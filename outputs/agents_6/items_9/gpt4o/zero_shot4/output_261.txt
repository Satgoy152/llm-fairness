Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16   2   4  15  19  31  38  52  65
1  41  59  72  89  31  75  62  86  36
2  39  78  49  85  26  99  33  29  26
3  42  60  27  65  43  20  95  59  69
4  26  56   8  90  39  71  48  58  93
5  46  84  33  93  40  39  85  33  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Considering there are 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will get more than one item.

We'll aim to distribute the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's an allocation strategy:

1. Assign the item with the highest valuation to each agent first.
2. Distribute remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations across all agents.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets item 8 (highest valuation among their items).
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (highest valuation among their items).
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (highest valuation among their items).
- Agent 3 gets item 6 (highest valuation among their items).
- Agent 4 gets item 7 (highest valuation among their items).
- Agent 5 gets item 1 (highest valuation among their items).

After each agent has at least one item, we allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 0, 2, 4
- Agent 5 can get item 4 (since they have the second highest valuation for it).
- Agent 3 can get item 2 (since they have the second highest valuation for it).
- Agent 0 can get item 0 (since they have the second highest valuation for it).

Thus, the allocation will be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```
