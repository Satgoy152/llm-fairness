Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  40  90  56  39   9   4  57  19
1  63  72  22   4  91  93  29  35  32
2  14  74  26  89  35  85  90  97  78
3  25  77  99   0  79  95   8  78  33
4  19  20  21  79  24  62   5  79  11
5  62  84  63  65  68  95  10  90   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Let's go through a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 highly (90). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 highly (93). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 7 highly (97). Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 highly, but it's already assigned. The next high-value items are 5 (95) and 1 (77). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 3 highly (79). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values items 5 and 1 highly, but both are already assigned. The next high-value items are 7 (90) and 4 (68). Assign item 4 to Agent 5.

Next, we need to assign the remaining items: 0, 6, and 8.

7. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 based on the second-highest preference (48) that is still available.
8. **Agent 1**: Assign item 8 based on the next available preference (32).
9. **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 based on the next available preference (90).

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of items according to their preferences and ensures that all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item based on their preferences.
