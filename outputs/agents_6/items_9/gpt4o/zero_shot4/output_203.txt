Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  20  42   1  68  62  56  39  13
1  93   6  30  22  27  91  47  10  49
2  47  87  74  82  78  76  94   6  38
3  82  34  56  53  97   0  63  30  17
4  72  63  42  57  22  75  37  62  90
5  39  71  68   1  59  74  51  16  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 0 (value 84)
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 5 (value 91)
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 6 (value 94)
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 4 (value 97)
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 8 (value 90)
6. Agent 5: Allocate item 1 (value 71)

Now, we still have three items (2, 3, 7) left to allocate. Let's allocate them to ensure a balanced distribution of items:

7. Agent 0: Allocate item 2 (value 42) - Total items for Agent 0: 2
8. Agent 3: Allocate item 3 (value 53) - Total items for Agent 3: 2
9. Agent 4: Allocate item 7 (value 62) - Total items for Agent 4: 2

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [8, 7],
    "5": [1]
}
```
