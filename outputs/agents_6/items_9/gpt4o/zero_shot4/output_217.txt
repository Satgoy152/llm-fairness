Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  32  81  43  65  82  58  44  93
1  87  88   3  99  20  41   8  84  49
2  65  28  14  90  32   8  98   7  69
3  28   1  93  55  71  99  22  97  63
4  75  17  28  84   3  33  66  54  20
5  80  83  79  33  42  37  58  16  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the six agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent is assigned items that maximize their total valuation. Given there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others due to the uneven number of items.

Let's start by identifying the highest value items for each agent and try to allocate them based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents starting with the highest value and ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Continue allocating until all items are assigned.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 8 the most (93).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (99).
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the most (98).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most (99).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the most (75).
6. Agent 5 values item 1 the most (83).

After allocating each agent one item, we have:

- Agent 0: [8]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [1]

Now, the remaining items are: 2, 4, 7.

Continue allocating remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 81).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (value 97).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 20).

So the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while trying to maximize the total valuation for each agent.
