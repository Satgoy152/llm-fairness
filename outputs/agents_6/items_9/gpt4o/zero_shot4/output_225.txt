Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  77   0  71  74  46  68  55  68
1  57  78  44  77  42  92  98   4  43
2  62  71  22  62   0  82  42  48  73
3  70  68  46  52  96  51  18  13  86
4  19  95  16   3  12  73  68  77  82
5  16  11   8   8  30  10  71  66  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (or the sum of valuations for each agent) is as balanced as possible. Each agent should receive at least one item, and we need to ensure that exactly 9 items are allocated.

To achieve this, we will follow a step-by-step method to allocate the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most among the remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item.
2. **Balance the Allocation**: After each agent has at least one item, distribute the remaining items by ensuring the total valuation for each agent is balanced.

Let's apply this strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 1 (value 77)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 6 (value 98)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 5 (value 82)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 4 (value 96)
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 1, but it's taken, so we select 8 (value 82)
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item is 6, but it's taken, so we select 7 (value 66)

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and each agent has at least one. We need to allocate 3 more items.

7. **Remaining Items**: 0, 2, 3
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 62)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 44)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 71)

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 9 items are distributed.
