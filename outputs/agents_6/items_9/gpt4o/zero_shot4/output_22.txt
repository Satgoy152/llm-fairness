Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  21  81   1  87  95  56  59   8
1  46  47   2  57  48  28  40  59  20
2  85   0  19  21  11  94  58  75  81
3  41  44  50  73  17  53  88   7  98
4  32  17  70  37  35  73  78  45   3
5  38  20  14  92  86  54  42  64  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. Below is a possible allocation based on the given table:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for this agent.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, which has a high valuation for this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, which is the highest value item for this agent.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 8 to Agent 3, which is the highest value item for this agent.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 6 to Agent 4, as it holds a high valuation for this agent.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 7 to Agent 5, as it holds a high valuation for this agent.

Now, we will allocate the remaining items to ensure each agent receives at least one item:

7. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (the second-highest available value for this agent).
8. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (the second-highest available value for this agent).
9. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 (the second-highest available value for this agent).

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [6, 2],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and we aim to provide a fair distribution based on the highest valuations.
