Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  52   5  57  85  67  12  93  47
1  48  99   9  74  28  90  28  55   4
2  74  78  88  84  38  56  93   1  42
3  57  81  40  89  95  18  16  29  39
4  68  10  18  80  51  74   9  69  82
5  49  95   3  71  34  41  60  31  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple heuristic that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. This involves assigning items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Look at each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most.
2. If an agent already has the maximum number of items possible (given that there are 6 agents and each should have at least one item, one agent will need to have 2 items), try to assign it to the next highest valuing agent.

Following this method:

- Item 0: Highest value is from agent 0 (83).
- Item 1: Highest value is from agent 1 (99).
- Item 2: Highest value is from agent 2 (88).
- Item 3: Highest value is from agent 3 (89).
- Item 4: Highest value is from agent 3 (95), but since agent 3 already has item 3, assign it to agent 0 (85).
- Item 5: Highest value is from agent 1 (90).
- Item 6: Highest value is from agent 2 (93).
- Item 7: Highest value is from agent 0 (93), but since agent 0 already has items 0 and 4, assign it to agent 1 (55).
- Item 8: Highest value is from agent 4 (82).

Thus, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly while maximizing the preferences of the agents.
