Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0   3   9  27  98  27  18  44  21
1   5  94  69  52  45  85  73  48  37
2  31  98  55  13  53   5   5   8  24
3  70   9  72  31   9  31  60  15  85
4  87  90   4  90  22  76  43  27   9
5  66  99  68  52  18  70  16  57  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is as fair as possible based on the valuations.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Sort agents based on their total valuations.
3. Start allocating items to agents based on their highest-valued items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 0 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 98 + 27 + 18 + 44 + 21 = 247
- Agent 1: 5 + 94 + 69 + 52 + 45 + 85 + 73 + 48 + 37 = 508
- Agent 2: 31 + 98 + 55 + 13 + 53 + 5 + 5 + 8 + 24 = 292
- Agent 3: 70 + 9 + 72 + 31 + 9 + 31 + 60 + 15 + 85 = 382
- Agent 4: 87 + 90 + 4 + 90 + 22 + 76 + 43 + 27 + 9 = 448
- Agent 5: 66 + 99 + 68 + 52 + 18 + 70 + 16 + 57 + 62 = 508

Agents sorted based on total valuation: 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 0.

Now, allocate items:

- Agent 1 has the highest total valuation, allocate their highest valued items: [1, 5].
- Agent 5 also has a high total valuation, allocate their highest valued items: [7].
- Agent 4, allocate their highest valued item: [3].
- Agent 3, allocate their highest valued item: [2].
- Agent 2, allocate their highest valued item: [0].
- Agent 0, allocate their highest valued item: [4].
- Remaining item [6] to agent 3 who has space for more.

Now all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and is relatively fair based on their valuations.
