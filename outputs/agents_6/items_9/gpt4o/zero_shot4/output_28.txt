Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  14   5  52  29  65  23  74  77
1  10  32  17   5  37  54   6  15  73
2  83  28  33   4  90  85   9  63  84
3   1  34  92  37  38  43  59  29  29
4  37  73  43  14  30  86  86  21   4
5  92  28  50  75  58  36  89  71  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. One approach is to use a method like maximizing the minimum satisfaction or simply distributing the items to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 6, 7, and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: Has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 0, 4, 5, and 8.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Has high valuations for items 1, 5, and 6.
6. **Agent 5**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 3.

Based on this, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2.

This allocation tries to balance the high valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed and each agent is considered.
