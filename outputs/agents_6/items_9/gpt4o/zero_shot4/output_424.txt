Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  32  37  38  67  32  92  60   6
1  44  11  78  65  87  67  65  26  75
2  49  47  55  93  94   0  76  29  25
3  40  10  44  42  41   4  30   8  73
4  50  16  37  28   5   0  96  54  65
5  67  77  35  20  57  43   6  52  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuations and aim to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction is maximized. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while also considering the total valuation.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the highest-valued item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Following this method, let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (67).
- Item 1: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (77).
- Item 2: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (78).
- Item 3: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (93).
- Item 4: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (87).
- Item 5: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (67).
- Item 6: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (96).
- Item 7: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (60).
- Item 8: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (90).

Now, let's ensure fairness and balance by checking if any agent has been allocated too many items. We can adjust allocations slightly to ensure a more balanced distribution if necessary. However, in this case, each agent should receive at least one item, if possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [7]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items []
- Agent 4: Items [6]
- Agent 5: Items [0, 1, 5, 8]

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 1, 5, 8]
}
```
