Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  65  14  96  54  63  65  23  35
1  33  94  25  25   2  80   0  59  64
2  83   0   5  71  98  67  72   5  41
3   7  74  59   8  63  83  25  61  57
4  74  67   9  40  32  59  27  21  41
5  73  52   6  75  16  56  91   7  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items so that the total value each agent receives is as equal as possible, given the constraint that each agent must get an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 4 and 6.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 5 and 7.
5. **Agent 4** has a relatively even distribution of value across items, but item 0 has a higher value.
6. **Agent 5** has high valuations for items 3 and 6.

Using this information, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocates item 3 (value 96).
- **Agent 1**: Allocates item 5 (value 80).
- **Agent 2**: Allocates item 4 (value 98).
- **Agent 3**: Allocates item 7 (value 61).
- **Agent 4**: Allocates item 0 (value 74).
- **Agent 5**: Allocates item 6 (value 91).

Now, for the remaining items 1, 2, and 8, we need to allocate these in a way to balance the distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Also take item 1 (value 65) to balance the allocation.
- **Agent 1**: Takes item 8 (value 64) to balance the allocation.
- **Agent 3**: Takes item 2 (value 59) to balance the allocation.

With these allocations, we ensure that all items are distributed, and each agent has a fair share based on their valuations. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6]
}
```
