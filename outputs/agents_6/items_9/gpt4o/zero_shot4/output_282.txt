Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  17  89  81  89  26  32  54  38
1   2   5  28  52  41  41  19  80  79
2  91  45  17  44  97  37   7   7  29
3  70  98  84   5  37  48  93  34  90
4  89  85  32   3  91  81  60  59  93
5  47  73  62  71  70  75  23  26  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. One way to approach this is by using a greedy algorithm, where we iteratively allocate items to the agent who values them most until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Identify the agent who values each item the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Continue until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 89.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 81.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
- Item 5: Agent 5 values it the most at 75.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 93.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most at 80.
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it the most at 90.

We need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, so let's adjust the allocation by balancing the distribution while maintaining high valuations.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: [1, 6]
- Agent 4: [8]
- Agent 5: [5]

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item and considers the highest valuations for the items.
