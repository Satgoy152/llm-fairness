Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79   3  30  62  38  63  54  71  73
1  83  56  57  75  89  77   9  61  12
2  15  16  66  50  11   2  55  45  16
3  51  44  68  22  66   8  37  22   7
4  24  25  97  10  24  67  56   4  65
5  40  97  91  85  57  98  16  15  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to distribute the 9 items such that each agent gets at least some value from the items they receive. Since the number of agents (6) is less than the number of items (9), not every agent will receive an item.

One way to approach this allocation is to ensure that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This can maximize the overall satisfaction among the agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuation by each agent for the respective items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 83, the highest among agents.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 5 values it at 97, the highest.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it at 97, the highest.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 5 values it at 85, the highest.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 89, the highest.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it at 98, the highest.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 54, the highest.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 71, the highest.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 73, the highest.

Using this approach, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets items based on their highest valuation, maximizing their satisfaction with the given items.
