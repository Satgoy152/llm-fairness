Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  51   0  76  91  86  52  66  66
1  40  59  64  61   3  98  18  26  21
2  10   1  16  54  16   5  35  38  56
3  18   7  64  96  15  36  88  27  11
4  42  75  67   4  31  36  25  11   2
5  65   7  29  45  17  64  16  82  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. The goal is to ensure each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4 (91), so we assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 5 (98), so we assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3 (96), so we assign item 3 to agent 3.
4. Agent 3 also has a high value for item 6 (88), so we assign item 6 to agent 3.
5. Agent 5 has a high value for item 7 (82), so we assign item 7 to agent 5.
6. Agent 1 has a high value for item 2 (64), so we assign item 2 to agent 1.
7. Agent 0 has a high value for item 1 (51), so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
8. Agent 4 has a high value for item 0 (42), so we assign item 0 to agent 4.
9. Agent 2 has a high value for item 8 (56), so we assign item 8 to agent 2.

Now all items have been allocated, and each agent has received an integer number of items.

The allocations in json format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7]
}
```
