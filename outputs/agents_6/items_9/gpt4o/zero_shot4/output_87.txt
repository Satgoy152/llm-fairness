Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  54  39  35  47  36   7  91  23
1   8  48  73  13   3  96  95  41  54
2  35  46   3  24  54  78  53  96  79
3  12   0   9  41  34  11  47  38  39
4  89  94  90  52  38  62  49  46  34
5  36  48  79  46  21  59   7  83  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations and aim to balance the total value of the items each agent receives. It may not always be possible to perfectly balance the values, but we can attempt to distribute the items as equitably as possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items 7, 0
2. Agent 1: Items 5, 6
3. Agent 2: Item 8
4. Agent 3: Items 3, 4
5. Agent 4: Item 1
6. Agent 5: Item 2

With this allocation, each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```
