Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  42   8  95  64   6  36  70  66
1  61  41   6  82  26  17  51   4  50
2  63  58  69  87  37  65  84  60  83
3  48  24   7  51  61  48  39  19  28
4  95  46  15  12  82  87  51  75  58
5  85  14  63  54  21  30  13  42  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61 41  6 82 26 17 51  4 50]
 [63 58 69 87 37 65 84 60 83]
 [48 24  7 51 61 48 39 19 28]
 [95 46 15 12 82 87 51 75 58]
 [85 14 63 54 21 30 13 42 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each receives at least one item. Let's examine the valuations and distribute the items to optimize the total value for each agent:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 0 and 3.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 5, 6, and 8.
4. Agent 3 doesn't have very high valuations, but item 4 and 5 are relatively higher for them.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0, 5, 6, and 7.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 0.

Now, we need to allocate these items to ensure each agent's total valuation is maximized, while each agent receives at least one item:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 80).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 82).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (valued at 69).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (valued at 87).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (valued at 24).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4 as well (valued at 51).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (valued at 61).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 5 (valued at 42).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (valued at 83).

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [7]
}
```
