Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  74  60  58   3  21  92  36  70
1  88  12  60  20  11  56  41  67  90
2  80  47  59  58  68  47  59  90  28
3   4   9  80  98  44  24  77  33  67
4  26  13  99  83  91  71  84  63  63
5  36  47  25  14  64   4  33  89  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the overall valuations and attempt to assign items such that the total valuation for each agent is balanced as much as possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0: Assign items that they value highly to maximize their overall valuation.
- Agent 1: Follow the same principle, maximizing their total valuation.
- Agent 2: And so on for each agent.

Let's attempt this allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (92), so assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 the highest (90), so assign item 8 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (90), so assign item 7 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (98), so assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (99), so assign item 2 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 8 highly as well (89), but since item 8 is taken, assign the next highest, item 7, but it's also taken, so assign item 5 to Agent 5 (highest available).
7. Assign remaining items by considering the next highest valuations:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (91).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (74).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (88).

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [8, 0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
