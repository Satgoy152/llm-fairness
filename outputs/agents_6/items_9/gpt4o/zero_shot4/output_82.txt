Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  43  47  76  38  90  61  11  69
1  75   2  20  64  63  20  65  61  84
2  94  60  11  90  29  12  88  43  97
3  42  76  76  92   6   6  13  77  97
4  76  20  31   9  49  19   3  11  10
5  96  72  63  27  89  39  96  55  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. First, find the highest value for each agent and allocate that item to them. This ensures each agent gets an item they highly value.

2. If two agents highly value the same item, allocate the item to the agent who values it more and consider the second agent's next highest valuation.

3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this approach:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 5 (90).
- **Agent 1** values item 8 the most (84).
- **Agent 2** values item 8 the most (97), but it's already taken by Agent 1. The next highest for Agent 2 is item 0 (94).
- **Agent 3** values item 8 the most (97), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3 (92).
- **Agent 4** values item 0 the most (76), but it's already taken by Agent 2. The next highest is item 4 (49).
- **Agent 5** values item 0 the most (96), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 6 (96).

Now, let's check unallocated items and assign them based on remaining highest valuations:

- Remaining items: 1, 2, 7
- Agent 0: Highest remaining is item 1 (43)
- Agent 4: Highest remaining is item 2 (31)
- Agent 3: Highest remaining is item 7 (77)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4, 2],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item they value relatively highly and all 9 items are allocated.
