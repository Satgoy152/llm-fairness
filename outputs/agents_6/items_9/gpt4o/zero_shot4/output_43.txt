Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  15  31  94  54  92  61  99  59
1  10  96  30   1  40  18  54  22  25
2  89  40  96  88  59  51  44  33  38
3  27  43  58   3  78  50  55  54  19
4  45  60  98  27  99  45  67  54   1
5  15  66   6  11  91  56  32  70   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Given there are 9 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally get at least 1 item, with some agents possibly receiving more than one if it leads to a more optimal allocation of value.

Let's start allocating items based on the maximum valuation each agent has for any item and proceed from there:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is 99 for item 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is 96 for item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is 96 for item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is 78 for item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is 99 for item 4, but since it's already chosen, the next highest is 98 for item 2, which is also taken. So we go with item 0 which is valued at 45.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is 91 for item 4, which is taken, so we give item 5 with value 56.

Now, some items are still unallocated. Let's allocate them to maximize the remaining values:

- Item 3 has not been allocated and has the highest value of 94 for agent 0.
- Item 6 has not been allocated and has the highest value of 61 for agent 0.
- Item 8 has not been allocated and has the highest value of 59 for agent 0.

Revisiting our initial allocations and ensuring all items are distributed, the allocations could be:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [3, 6, 8]
2. **Agent 1**: Item [1]
3. **Agent 2**: Item [2]
4. **Agent 3**: (no items left, so empty)
5. **Agent 4**: Item [0]
6. **Agent 5**: Item [5]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
