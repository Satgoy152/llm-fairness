Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  80  87  68   1  77  44  97  95
1  48  46  30  68   3  11  66  38  71
2  41   0  57  41  18  22  42  83  89
3  65  54   4  52  95  15  28  30  36
4  88  44  77  60  56  85  43   1  76
5  49   7  80  39  42  32  20  84  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. A possible approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item. If conflicts arise (an agent would receive more items than others), adjust by considering the next highest valuation.

Following this strategy, here is one set of allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (97), so assign item 7 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 8 the most (71), so assign item 8 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the most, but it’s already assigned. The next highest for agent 2 is item 7, but it's also assigned. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (57).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (95), so assign item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (88), so assign item 0 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 2 the most, but it’s already assigned. Assign item 1 to agent 5 (7).

Now, reassign unallocated items:

- Items 3, 5, and 6 are unassigned.
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (68) as it is the highest remaining unassigned valuation for them.
- Assign item 5 to agent 4 (85) because it's a high value for them.
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (66) based on their next highest preference.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [8, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair number of items based on their preferences while distributing all 9 items among the agents.
