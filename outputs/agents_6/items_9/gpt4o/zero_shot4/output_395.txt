Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  13  39  14  24  98  11  15  14
1  90  99  77  85  61  19  30  80  55
2  41  82  52  29  41  81   2  28   9
3  31  56  90  11  29  75  50  68  39
4  89  83  51  84  28  63  78  74  65
5  57  63  60  56  20  17  76  71  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations and constraints, one possible allocation is as follows:

1. Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 98).
2. Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 99).
3. Agent 2 gets item 7 (value 28).
4. Agent 3 gets item 2 (value 90).
5. Agent 4 gets item 0 (value 89).
6. Agent 5 gets item 6 (value 76).

This leaves us with items 3, 4, and 8. The remaining allocation could be done as follows to balance and maximize value:

7. Agent 3 gets item 8 (value 39).
8. Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 28).
9. Agent 5 gets item 3 (value 56).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, the total number of items allocated is 9, and it aims to maximize the value for each agent given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": [6, 3]
}
```
