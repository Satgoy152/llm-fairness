Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  66  72  12  93  16  18  95  47
1  69  62  34  55   7  12  30  74  43
2   7  19  92  83  27  32  39   0  78
3  72  32  17   3   6  22  24  94  99
4   4  13  59  44   9  55  96  77  19
5  38   8  15  69  98  94   9  61  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is roughly balanced, while also ensuring each agent receives at least one item (when possible) and every item is allocated to an agent.

Here is a possible allocation of the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 7 (Values: 97, 95)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (Value: 55)
3. **Agent 2**: Items 2 and 8 (Values: 92, 78)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4 (Value: 6)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 6 (Value: 96)
6. **Agent 5**: Items 1 and 5 (Values: 8, 94)

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and the distribution across agents is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
