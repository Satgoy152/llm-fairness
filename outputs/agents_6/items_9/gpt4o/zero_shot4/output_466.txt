Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33   1  53  44  91  64  60  73  28
1  94  68  33  92  97  82  80  77  54
2  35  20  40  36  34   6  64  45  26
3  15  88  74  88  27  79  58  99   8
4  50  50  66  35  56   8  40  21  87
5  35  12  79  67  49  54  85  83  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent receives items in such a way that their total value is approximately balanced. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of their preferred items, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate items that have relatively high value for this agent. For instance, item 4 is highly valued.
2. Agent 1: Focus on items with high value for this agent. Item 0 and item 4 are top preferences.
3. Agent 2: Allocate items that match this agent's preference. Item 6 has a relatively high value.
4. Agent 3: Allocate items based on high preferences, such as item 7 and item 1.
5. Agent 4: Allocate items based on this agent's preference. Item 8 is highly valued.
6. Agent 5: Allocate items with a focus on higher value. Item 2 and item 3 are suitable choices.

In this manner, we ensure that each agent gets items corresponding to their highest values while keeping the total allocation balanced.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
