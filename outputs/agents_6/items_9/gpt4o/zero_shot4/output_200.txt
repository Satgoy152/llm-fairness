Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  66   7  38  65  88  34  91  57
1  92   5  93  51  66  15  23  35  88
2  53  27  90  30  68  55  68  87   1
3  54  74  52  19  43  24  85  48  65
4  93  77  22  71  56  65  51  53  19
5   6  25  72  22  33  22  97  51  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we'll aim to distribute them based on the agents' valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here’s a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item is item 7 (value 91).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item is item 2 (value 93).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item is item 2, but it's already taken.
   - Next highest value item is item 7 (value 87), but it's already taken.
   - Allocate item 4 (value 68) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value item is item 6 (value 85).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value item is item 0 (value 93).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest value item is item 6, but it’s already taken.
   - Next highest value item is item 2 (value 72), but it's already taken.
   - Allocate item 8 (value 53) to Agent 5.

This leaves us with 3 items (1, 3, 5) unallocated. We need to ensure all items are allocated:

7. **Agent 0** can take item 1 (value 66).
8. **Agent 1** can take item 8 (value 88).
9. **Agent 3** can take item 5 (value 24).

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest values while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.
