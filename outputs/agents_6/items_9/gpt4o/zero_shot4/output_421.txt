Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  40  83  23  72  13   1  72  95
1  28  90  62  22  71  87   4  62   1
2  20  95  24   1  42  47  57  84  15
3  72  74   4  19  45  58  91  95  48
4  28  10  11  50  73  32   3  98  18
5  99  92  85  74  41  36  70  45  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, given there are 9 items and 6 agents. Here's one way to allocate based on maximizing each agent's valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 8 (95) and 2 (83), but 8 is more valued. Assign item 8 to agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 1 (90). Assign item 1 to agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 1 (95), but it's taken. Next highest is item 7 (84). Assign item 7 to agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 7 (95), but it's taken. Next highest is item 6 (91). Assign item 6 to agent 3.
   
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 7 (98), but it's taken. Next highest is item 4 (73). Assign item 4 to agent 4.
   
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 0 (99). Assign item 0 to agent 5.

Now, allocate the remaining items 2, 3, and 5 to ensure each agent gets at least one item and maximize their value:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (83) is also a high-value item for agent 0, but agent 0 already has item 8.
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (62) is next in value. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (1).
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 5 (36).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, while maximizing their individual valuations as much as possible.
