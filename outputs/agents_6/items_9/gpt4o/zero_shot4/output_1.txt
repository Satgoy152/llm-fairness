Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  95  23  74  27  32  33   7  32
1  70  57  68  77  41  80  29  55  58
2   7  78   5  62  17  74  92  50  84
3  70  67  80  70  98  86  98  57  61
4  33  94  59  31  59  73  74  99  49
5  24  35  54  92  52  29  26  22  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items based on each agent's valuations to ensure a balanced allocation. In this context, we try to give each agent some of their higher-valued items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are assigned.

Given the valuation matrix, we can start by selecting the highest-value item for each agent and then allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations while ensuring that each item is allocated only once and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Initially consider item 1 (highest value 95), then item 0.
2. Agent 1: Item 3 (77) and item 5 (80).
3. Agent 2: Item 6 (92).
4. Agent 3: Item 4 (98).
5. Agent 4: Item 7 (99).
6. Agent 5: Item 8 (86).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8]
}
```
