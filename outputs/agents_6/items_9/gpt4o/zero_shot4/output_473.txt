Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  17  47   9  19  47  43  48  64
1  25  92  89  15  90  25  35  68  52
2  34  22  52  39  63  95  74   4  84
3  56  21  65  58  55  46  32  82   9
4  95  61  17  78  41  28   3  78  34
5  56  92  36  97   5  13  68  72  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy of assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each agent gets the items they value highly, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Let's go through the items one by one and assign them to the agents:

- **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most at 95.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 92.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 89.
- **Item 3**: Agent 5 values it the most at 97.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 90.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 74.
- **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most at 82.
- **Item 8**: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```
