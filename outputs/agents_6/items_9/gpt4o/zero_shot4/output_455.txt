Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  57  95  60  60  16  67  21  21
1  31  49  91  36  12  33  84  23  74
2  81  88  21  13  91   6  17  51   1
3  30  84  90  53  56  25  57  99  92
4  97  39  87  93  18  24  39  22  10
5  89  51  99  38  89  46  24  22  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction based on the given valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation approach:
- Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

After evaluating the valuations, the following allocation can be made:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2] (valuations: 76, 95)
- Agent 1: Items [6] (valuation: 84)
- Agent 2: Items [4] (valuation: 91)
- Agent 3: Items [7, 8] (valuations: 99, 92)
- Agent 4: Items [3] (valuation: 93)
- Agent 5: Items [1, 5] (valuations: 51, 46)

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
