Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  80  18  20  82   2  93  96  30
1  92  83  48  84  55  88  67  40  54
2  14  54  94  55  55  21  61  42  78
3  61   9  34  23  57  34  55   1  26
4  93  78  38  65  51  79  11   4  81
5  48  24  75  35  23  58  56  73  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can follow these steps:

1. Each agent should ideally receive an equal number of items if possible. Given there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives.

2. Sort the valuations for each item across all agents and assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This method ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who finds it most valuable.

3. Check to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable distribution of items by adjusting allocations as necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items based on the above approach:

1. Item 0: Agent 4 values it most at 93.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it most at 80.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it most at 94.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it most at 84.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it most at 82.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it most at 88.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it most at 93.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it most at 96.
9. Item 8: Agent 4 values it most at 81.

Adjusting to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0 has 4 items (1, 4, 6, 7).
- Agent 1 has 2 items (3, 5).
- Agent 2 has 1 item (2).
- Agent 3 has 0 items.
- Agent 4 has 2 items (0, 8).
- Agent 5 has 0 items.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 8],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed while trying to maximize each agent's total valuation.
