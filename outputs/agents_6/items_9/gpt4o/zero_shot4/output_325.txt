Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  93  96  92  78  38  46  44  60
1  90   7  11  95  42   5  64  57  23
2  75  92  34  74  95  71   9  17  12
3  10  74  67  38  86  18  36  15  15
4  73  93  95   8  80  42  78  90   0
5  49  18  49  21  94  54  26  24  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90  7 11 95 42  5 64 57 23]

 [73 93 95  8 80 42 78 90  0]
 [49 18 49 21 94 54 26 24 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing the total value.

Let's consider a greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest valuation an agent has for an item until all items are assigned.

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for several items. Let's allocate items 0, 2, and 1 to Agent 0 because they have the highest values for those items.
2. Agent 1 can be allocated item 3, which they value at 95.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4, which they value at 95.
4. Agent 3 can be allocated item 5, which they value at 18.
5. Agent 4 can be given item 6, which they value at 78.
6. Agent 5 can be given items 7 and 8, which they value at 24 and 57, respectively.

This allocation strategy ensures that we distribute the items based on high valuations and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7, 8]
}
```
