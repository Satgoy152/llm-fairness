Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  49  96  74  88  11  13  94  41
1  43  46  34  17   7   8  15  78  19
2  20  92  19  15  15  29   5  45  95
3  22  45  17  87  83  76  97  36  95
4  87  99  34  39  13  77  86   2  90
5  24  35  21  65  94  10  76  77   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. However, since there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's assign items based on maximizing individual agents' values for those items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (97), 2 (96), 7 (94)
   - Allocate items 0, 2, 7 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items not yet allocated: 7 (78)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items not yet allocated: 8 (95)
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items not yet allocated: 6 (97)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value items not yet allocated: 1 (99)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest value items not yet allocated: 4 (94)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 5

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 3 more. Since Agent 3 and Agent 5 currently have only one item, we can give the remaining items to them based on their next highest valuations:

- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (87)
- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 5 (10)

This leaves us with item 3, as it was allocated twice in error. Correcting this, item 3 is assigned to Agent 3, and item 5 is reassigned to Agent 5. Now, allocate the last item:

- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 3 (65)

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items based on the highest valuations they have for the items, ensuring a fair distribution with the available items.
