Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  47  60  76  57  19  27   8  35
1  89  62  49  62  27   2   8  96  29
2  71  18  56  40  50  97  24  39  88
3  93  10  87  95  11  69  21  58  97
4  28   1   8  10  53  49  63  80  98
5  30   5   6  36  47  44  46   6  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents given their valuations, we can use a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, leading to a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation of items to agents:

1. Item 0 is most valued by agent 3 (value 93).
2. Item 1 is most valued by agent 1 (value 62).
3. Item 2 is most valued by agent 3 (value 87).
4. Item 3 is most valued by agent 3 (value 95).
5. Item 4 is most valued by agent 0 (value 57).
6. Item 5 is most valued by agent 2 (value 97).
7. Item 6 is most valued by agent 4 (value 63).
8. Item 7 is most valued by agent 1 (value 96).
9. Item 8 is most valued by agent 4 (value 98).

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2, 3],
    "4": [6, 8],
    "5": []
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent with the highest valuation for it, and all 9 items are allocated.
