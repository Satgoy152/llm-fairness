Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  54  80  40  55  13  93  76  17
1  91  58  90  13  86  87  51  58  81
2  58  65  27  76  49  76  25   2  16
3  40   1  11  91  46  87  40  50  47
4  96  44   8  31  25  89  36   9  42
5  80  73  19   7  10  41  68  80  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is relatively balanced, while ensuring that each agent has an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents with the goal of balancing the total valuations as closely as possible.

Let's go through the steps:

- Agent 0: [71, 54, 80, 40, 55, 13, 93, 76, 17] -> Total = 499
- Agent 1: [91, 58, 90, 13, 86, 87, 51, 58, 81] -> Total = 615
- Agent 2: [58, 65, 27, 76, 49, 76, 25, 2, 16] -> Total = 394
- Agent 3: [40, 1, 11, 91, 46, 87, 40, 50, 47] -> Total = 413
- Agent 4: [96, 44, 8, 31, 25, 89, 36, 9, 42] -> Total = 380
- Agent 5: [80, 73, 19, 7, 10, 41, 68, 80, 76] -> Total = 454

Allocate items as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 6] (Items with high value for Agent 0)
- Agent 1: [1, 2] (Items with high value for Agent 1)
- Agent 2: [3] (Select higher value item for Agent 2)
- Agent 3: [5] (Select higher value item for Agent 3)
- Agent 4: [4, 8] (Select higher value items for Agent 4)
- Agent 5: [7] (Select higher value item for Agent 5)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonably balanced total value, and all 9 items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 8],
    "5": [7]
}
```
