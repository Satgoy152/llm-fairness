Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  15  77  42  30  30  22   2  23
1  79  99  98  66  75  46  97  39  82
2  43  55  53  83  22   0  27  41  26
3   4  95   0  76  80  76  21  52  50
4  82  89  23  31  97  24  59  78  83
5  92  80  39   5  22   6  61  53  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method that ensures each agent gets at least one item, as there are 9 items and 6 agents. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations to ensure agents receive items they value more. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item first and then continue assigning based on remaining items and highest valuations until all items are allocated.

2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 77)
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 99)
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 83)
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (value 80)
- Agent 4 gets item 5 (value 24)
- Agent 5 gets item 0 (value 92)

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and 3 items are left to allocate. We can assign them based on remaining high valuations:

- Agent 1 also gets item 6 (value 97)
- Agent 4 also gets item 7 (value 78)
- Agent 0 also gets item 8 (value 23)

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [0]
}
```
