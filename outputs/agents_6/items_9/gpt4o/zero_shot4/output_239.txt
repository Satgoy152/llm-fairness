Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  59  71  71  51  41  26  31  53
1  84  26   2  27  41  37  24  30  52
2   0   6  47  12  13  35  46  18  28
3  69  69  78  22  73  13  17   1  13
4  54  33  92  89  80   1  14  26  94
5  95  89  52  13  50  19  12  57  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Additionally, all 9 items should be allocated.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Item 2 (highest value for agent 0)
2. **Agent 1:** Item 0 (highest value for agent 1)
3. **Agent 2:** Item 6 (highest value for agent 2)
4. **Agent 3:** Item 3 (highest value for agent 3)
5. **Agent 4:** Items 4 and 8 (highest values for agent 4)
6. **Agent 5:** Items 1, 5, and 7 (remaining items with relatively high values for agent 5)

This allocation ensures all agents receive at least one item, respects the highest valuations where possible, and ensures all items are allocated.

The allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 8],
    "5": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items based on the individual preferences of the agents while ensuring all items are assigned.
