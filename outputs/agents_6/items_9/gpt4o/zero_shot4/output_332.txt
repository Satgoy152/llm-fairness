Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  76  31  88   6  12  56  40  35
1  10  35   1  46  29  14  10  35   4
2  93  70  41  85  66  90   2  72  52
3  56  37  17  84  71   3  14  83  14
4  22  42  61  74  11  52  28  66  16
5  79  15  41  82  50   6  90  47  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. Additionally, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assigning items based on highest valuations for each agent.
2. Ensuring that each item is allocated to one agent only.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 1.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3, but it's already considered for agent 0.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 3.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 3 and 6.
- Agent 5 has high valuations for items 0, 6, and 8.

Considering these preferences and aiming for a fair distribution, the allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:

- Each agent receives at least one item (except agent 4, who receives a single item).
- All 9 items are allocated.
- The allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations each agent has for their items, given the constraints.
