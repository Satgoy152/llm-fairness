Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  61   0  77  20  13  33  65  99
1  35  80  28  29  75  51  23  75  18
2  24  79  56  74  59  78  67  53  33
3  19  85  48  81  52  99  21  32  86
4   0  48  30  31  31  61  40  59  90
5  88  11  23  62   2  86   3  38  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items amongst the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined.
2. Sort agents based on their total valuation.
3. Allocate items to maximize each agent's total value, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate total value each agent has:
   - Agent 0: 383
   - Agent 1: 414
   - Agent 2: 523
   - Agent 3: 523
   - Agent 4: 390
   - Agent 5: 367

2. Sort agents based on total valuation (descending order):
   - Agents 2 and 3 (523)
   - Agent 1 (414)
   - Agent 4 (390)
   - Agent 0 (383)
   - Agent 5 (367)

3. Allocate items:
   - Agent 2: Highest value items are 5, 3, 6
   - Agent 3: Highest value items are 5, 8, 3
   - Agent 1: Highest value items are 1, 4
   - Agent 4: Highest value item is 8
   - Agent 0: Highest value item is 7
   - Agent 5: Highest value item is 0

4. Adjust allocation to ensure each item is given only once:
   - Agent 2: [3, 5, 6]
   - Agent 3: [8]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4]
   - Agent 4: []
   - Agent 0: [7]
   - Agent 5: [0, 2]

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair distribution of items based on their valuation preferences, and each item is assigned only once.
