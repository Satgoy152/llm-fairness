Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  62  98  65  64  14   9  88  39
1  47  46  62  33  80  49  20  94  40
2  72  78  83  58  74  55   4   9   0
3  59  87  64  27  77  83  10  38  85
4  53  49  83  32  46  78  81  97  17
5  74  34  25  21  31   4  94  11  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is as balanced as possible based on the agents' valuations. Here's a suggested allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 2, 7
2. **Agent 1**: Items 4, 1
3. **Agent 2**: Items 0, 3
4. **Agent 3**: Item 8
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5
6. **Agent 5**: Item 6

This distribution aims to balance the overall value each agent receives based on their preferences, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
