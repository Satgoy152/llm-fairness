Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  48  62  47  95   2  44  89  32
1  93  46  48  91  18  42   5  54   6
2  43  90   2   1  40   1  75  36  36
3  55  15  24  95  85  16  91  35  60
4  31  68  58  87  38  64   8  26  81
5   8  14  91  50  29  73  65  25  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can consider each agent's highest-valued items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives some of their higher-valued items. This is an attempt to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (95), Item 7 (89)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (93), Item 3 (91)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (90), Item 6 (75)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (95), Item 6 (91)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (81), Item 1 (68)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (91), Item 5 (73)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate Item 4
- **Agent 1**: Allocate Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Allocate Item 1
- **Agent 3**: Allocate Item 3
- **Agent 4**: Allocate Item 8
- **Agent 5**: Allocate Item 2

We still have Items 5, 6, and 7 to allocate. Let's distribute them to balance the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Add Item 7
- **Agent 2**: Add Item 6
- **Agent 5**: Add Item 5

Now, each agent gets at least one high-valued item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
