Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  14  72  97  10  83  44  11  73
1  46  10  74  29  63  41  81  32  63
2  64  85  83  21   2  72  70  83  71
3  50  59  85  44  36  88  95  93  28
4  16  61  82  48  16   2  57  67   0
5  59  60  21  28  62  70   2  46  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the total value of the items for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are assigned.

One simple method is to allocate the items based on each agent's highest valuation while ensuring every item is allocated and that the allocations are as balanced as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0, 3, and 5 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 and 6 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 1, 4, and 7 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 8 highly and can be given item 3 as a reasonable choice.
5. Agent 4 can be given items with lower competition, as they have generally lower valuations.
6. Agent 5 can be given any remaining items with moderate value.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [1, 7]
- Agent 3: [8]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [4, 5]

With this allocation, each item is allocated, and each agent has a reasonable distribution of items based on their valuations. 

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures every item is distributed, and each agent's preferences are considered as much as possible given the constraints.
