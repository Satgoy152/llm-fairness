Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  57  67  26  30  74  27  59   5
1  81  96  13  21  23  39  56  88  42
2  11  15  35  80  47  66  91  53  39
3  75  94  55  88  65  68  69  64  94
4  42   9  73  59  13  32  78  46  29
5   3  73  38  13  77  35  26  38   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we'll consider giving each agent a number of items proportional to their total valuation across all items. This can help ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their preferences.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 77 + 57 + 67 + 26 + 30 + 74 + 27 + 59 + 5 = 422
- Agent 1: 81 + 96 + 13 + 21 + 23 + 39 + 56 + 88 + 42 = 459
- Agent 2: 11 + 15 + 35 + 80 + 47 + 66 + 91 + 53 + 39 = 437
- Agent 3: 75 + 94 + 55 + 88 + 65 + 68 + 69 + 64 + 94 = 672
- Agent 4: 42 + 9 + 73 + 59 + 13 + 32 + 78 + 46 + 29 = 381
- Agent 5: 3 + 73 + 38 + 13 + 77 + 35 + 26 + 38 + 8 = 311

The total valuation for all agents is 2682.

Next, we calculate the expected number of items each agent should receive based on their total valuation:

- Agent 0: (422 / 2682) * 9 ≈ 1.42
- Agent 1: (459 / 2682) * 9 ≈ 1.54
- Agent 2: (437 / 2682) * 9 ≈ 1.47
- Agent 3: (672 / 2682) * 9 ≈ 2.26
- Agent 4: (381 / 2682) * 9 ≈ 1.28
- Agent 5: (311 / 2682) * 9 ≈ 1.04

Since the agents can only receive whole items, we will round these values and ensure that the total number of items is exactly 9.

Assigning items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 3 has the highest total valuation and should receive the most items. Allocate items 3 and 8 to Agent 3, which are the highest valued for them.
- Agent 1 should receive the second most and will get items 1 and 7.
- Agent 0 will receive item 0.
- Agent 2 will receive items 6 and 5.
- Agent 4 will receive item 2.
- Agent 5 will receive item 4.

Let's ensure this allocation sums to 9 items total.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents while keeping their valuations in mind.
