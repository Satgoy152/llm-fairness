Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  22  29  62  68  64  86   5  35
1  65  24  87  24  87  15  34  61  45
2  67  82   3  41   7   9  65   4  85
3  65  89  29   1   2  40  29   2  92
4  90  64  87  11   8  45  84  91  50
5   4  24  60  21  97  12   7  45  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents based on their valuations, we can follow the algorithm of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We aim to distribute the 9 items among the 6 agents.

1. **Initial Allocation**: Assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. **Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 0 (value 99)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 2 (value 87)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 8 (value 85)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 1 (value 89)
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 0 (value 90), but it's already taken, so we choose item 2 (value 87)
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item is 4 (value 97)

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 3: Assign to Agent 0 (value 62)
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 0 (value 64)
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 4 (value 84)
- Item 7: Assign to Agent 4 (value 91)

Let's ensure each agent has at least one item and count all items:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [8]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [6, 7]
- Agent 5: [4]

All 9 items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [4]
}
```
