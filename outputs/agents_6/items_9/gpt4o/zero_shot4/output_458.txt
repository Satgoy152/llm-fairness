Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  68  95  80  75  55   2  68  70
1  97  30  63  43  94  31  54  25  12
2  99   0  16  75  16  76  79  74  24
3  17  65  43   7  81  91  38  97  35
4  21  10  49  82  75  42  29  60  17
5   3  83  74   3  97  91  37  67  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is balanced as much as possible. We can consider each agent's preferences and try to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible, given the constraints).

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They have high valuations across several items, but we can allocate some of the highest-valued items to others for balance.
2. **Agent 1**: They have high valuation for item 0 and item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: They have high valuation for item 0 and item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: They have high valuation for item 7 and item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: They have relatively lower valuations but can receive items not highly valued by others.
6. **Agent 5**: They have high valuation for item 1 and item 4.

Considering these observations, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 1] (valuations: 95, 68 for a total of 163)
- Agent 1 gets item [0] (valuation: 97)
- Agent 2 gets items [5, 6] (valuations: 76, 79 for a total of 155)
- Agent 3 gets item [7] (valuation: 97)
- Agent 4 gets item [4] (valuation: 75)
- Agent 5 gets item [3, 8] (valuations: 3, 53 for a total of 56)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is nine.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 8]
}
```
