Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  45  52   5  94  35  81   1   0
1  33  90  71  22  88   9   0  23  65
2   2  60  59  48  85  19  64  80  58
3  59  57  43  85  39  92  52  31  97
4  90  83  75  37  68  44  45  85  83
5  88  64  12  22  53  23  47  35  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's follow these steps to determine an optimal allocation:

1. **List and Rank Valuations**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. **Allocate High-Value Items**: Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most.
3. **Ensure Fairness**: Attempt to distribute items such that each agent has a fair share, considering their valuations.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations

- Agent 0: Total value = 69 + 45 + 52 + 5 + 94 + 35 + 81 + 1 + 0 = 382
- Agent 1: Total value = 33 + 90 + 71 + 22 + 88 + 9 + 0 + 23 + 65 = 401
- Agent 2: Total value = 2 + 60 + 59 + 48 + 85 + 19 + 64 + 80 + 58 = 475
- Agent 3: Total value = 59 + 57 + 43 + 85 + 39 + 92 + 52 + 31 + 97 = 555
- Agent 4: Total value = 90 + 83 + 75 + 37 + 68 + 44 + 45 + 85 + 83 = 610
- Agent 5: Total value = 88 + 64 + 12 + 22 + 53 + 23 + 47 + 35 + 92 = 436

### Step 2: Allocate Items

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (90)
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (90)
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (71)
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (85)
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (94)
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (92)
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (81)
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (80)
- **Item 8**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (97)

### Step 3: Final Allocation

Based on the above, here's a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 5, 8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value the most, while maintaining fairness and ensuring all 9 items are allocated. Agent 5 receives no items in this distribution given their lower relative valuations.
