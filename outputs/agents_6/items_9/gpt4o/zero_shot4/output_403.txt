Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  13   3  32  56  24  19  53  44
1  46   9  67  93  39  20  99  13  18
2   0  44  74   0  85  54  54  69  56
3  25  10  27   3  90  99  26  43  85
4  24  68  36  27  98  65  34  66  87
5  64  67  12  19  47  80  90  56  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 67 12 19 47 80 90 56 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their individual valuations. Here's a reasonable approach to this allocation problem:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent**: Start by assigning the item each agent values the most, ensuring no two agents get the same item initially.
2. **Iterate through remaining items**: Distribute the remaining items such that agents have an approximately equal number of items, and priority is given to agents for whom the remaining items have higher value.

Based on the table provided, let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (99).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (99).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (85).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (99).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (98), but it's already allocated, so choose next highest available: item 8 (87).
- Agent 5 values item 8 the most (94), but it's already allocated, so choose next highest available: item 6 (90).

Now we have items assigned as follows:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [8]
- Agent 5: []

Remaining items: 1, 2, 3, 7

Next, distribute the remaining items to ensure each agent has approximately the same number of items, starting with those who have fewer items.

- Agent 5 gets item 7 (56).
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (93).
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (74).
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (10).

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
