Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  31  81  40  96  39  21   3  40
1  31  31   5  61  58   7  89  75  80
2  98  15  82  55  11  57  25  75  10
3  31  17  89  30  20  87  40  20  64
4  85  63   8  14  38  73  90  78  78
5  90  71  82  55  93  10   0  99  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a number of items such that the total allocations equal 9. We'll aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are items 4 (96), 2 (81), and 0 (36).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are items 6 (89), 8 (80), and 3 (61).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are items 0 (98), 2 (82), and 3 (55).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are items 2 (89), 5 (87), and 8 (64).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuations are items 6 (90), 5 (73), and 1 (63).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuations are items 7 (99), 0 (90), and 4 (93).

A fair approach is to allocate items in a way that balances the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. However, since we have more agents than items, some agents may not receive any items. Here's one possible allocation based on balancing their values:

- **Agent 0:** [2, 4]
- **Agent 1:** [6, 8]
- **Agent 3:** [5]
- **Agent 4:** [1]
- **Agent 5:** [0, 3, 7]

Agent 2 will not receive any items in this allocation. The allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, except for Agent 2, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 3, 7]
}
```
