Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  39  13  64  29  18   9   4  86
1  66  13   6  82  73  93  24  26  27
2  48  25  99  18  61  15  81  49  66
3  21  13  28  18  29  45  86  80   6
4  87  41  84  59  85  26  41  59  51
5  23  91  82  67  68  24  94  65  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their perceived value. However, we also need to ensure that the total number of allocated items equals 9, as there are 9 items in total. 

One potential approach is to allocate the items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, while trying to balance the total number of items each agent receives. Below is one possible allocation:

1. Analyze the highest valuations for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it most, while ensuring that the number of items allocated to each agent is balanced.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (Value: 70), Item 8 (Value: 86)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (Value: 93)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (Value: 99), Item 6 (Value: 81)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (Value: 80)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (Value: 85)
- Agent 5: Item 1 (Value: 91), Item 3 (Value: 67)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items, with some agents receiving more items due to their higher valuations on specific items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
