Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  36   3  84  56  70  52  50  10
1  24  74  60  19  60  25  86  70  26
2  86  44  54  87  56   9  93  71  88
3   5  27  27  45  39  99  48  84  13
4  76  82  35  23  39  49  10  48  41
5  73  42  74  47  80  49  59  24  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy approach where each agent is allocated items based on their highest valuations. The goal is to ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent may get one or more items.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each agent and allocate accordingly.**
2. **Ensure that all items are allocated, and no item is allocated more than once.**

Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 3, as it has the highest value for agent 0.
- Agent 1: Allocate item 6, as it has the highest value for agent 1.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 3, but since it is already allocated, we choose the next highest value, which is item 6. However, since that is also taken, we allocate item 2.
- Agent 3: Allocate item 5, as it has the highest value for agent 3.
- Agent 4: Allocate item 1, as it has the highest value for agent 4.
- Agent 5: Allocate item 8, as it has the highest value for agent 5.

After this initial allocation, we need to ensure that all items are assigned. So, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 4, and 7.

- Agent 0: Allocate item 0.
- Agent 4: Allocate item 4.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 7.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, and no item being allocated more than once.
