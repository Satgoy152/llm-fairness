Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  83   4  38  20  17  90  87  97
1   1  35  54  42  72  26  99   3  24
2  14  97  82  49  68  86  46  30  42
3  72  21  76  76  19  59  68  42  32
4  81  72  58  94  79  85  35   6  72
5  60  73  17  50  98  87  21  47  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent gets at least one item while maximizing their total valuation. Here is one possible allocation:

Agent 0 values item 8 highly, so we can start by allocating item 8 to Agent 0. Agent 1 values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 1. Agent 2 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2. Agent 3 values item 2 highly, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3. Agent 4 values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 4. Finally, Agent 5 values item 4 and item 5 highly, so we allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 5.

Now, we have the following allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 8
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Items 4 and 5

We have allocated 7 items, so we need to allocate 2 more items. Let's allocate items 0 and 7 to Agents 0 and 4, respectively, as they are the highest valued remaining items for those agents.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 7],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, and all 9 items are distributed while maximizing agents' valuations.
