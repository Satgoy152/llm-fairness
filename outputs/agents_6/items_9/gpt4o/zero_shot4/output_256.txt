Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  22  17  36  27  33  69  83  24
1   5  11  82  86  57  81  35  32  84
2  61  56  96  87  23   6  38  42  10
3  37  92  89  95  78  82  46  79  71
4  81  36  89  29  59  53  87  38  23
5  92  26  44  72  26  45  60  49  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will aim for a balanced distribution of total valuation among the agents, while also ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent and that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items considering a balanced distribution of value:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 and 7 highly, so we'll allocate those to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values items 2, 3, and 8 highly, so we'll allocate those to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly, which is already taken, so we'll allocate item 0 to Agent 2 since it's the highest remaining valuation for them.
4. Agent 3 values items 1, 3, and 5 highly, so we'll allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 highly, which is already taken, so we'll allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 8 highly, which is already taken, so we'll allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Now let's ensure all items are allocated, and each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0
- Agent 3: Items 1
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Items 8, 5

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8, 5]
}
```

With this allocation, each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations.
