Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  90  70  68  48  83  17  31  65
1  20  12  70  62  71  88  80  39  29
2  14  34  23   5  92  70  71  49  46
3  48  76   9  29  89  35  65  28  64
4  43  99  11  18  32  49  86  39  35
5  72  15  52  98  50  17  67  56  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations while also considering that each agent must receive an integer number of items. Given that there are 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. One approach is to allocate items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 1 (value 90)
2. Agent 1: Items 2 (value 70), 5 (value 88)
3. Agent 2: Item 4 (value 92)
4. Agent 3: Items 3 (value 29), 8 (value 64)
5. Agent 4: Item 0 (value 43), 6 (value 86)
6. Agent 5: Item 7 (value 56)

    "5": [7]
}
