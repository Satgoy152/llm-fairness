Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  86  80  38  48  78  84  26  60
1  32   1  78  45  20  44   3  53  14
2  55  99  86  76  16  66  50  36  57
3   1  23  29  11  33  85  68  22  25
4  94  87  35  58  34   5  84  53  65
5  35  23  56  48  85  86  56  73   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations and ensuring that the distribution is balanced. We'll aim to give each agent at least one item and distribute them according to their preferences as much as possible.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest valuations: Items 0 (81), 1 (86), 6 (84)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: Items 2 (78), 7 (53), 3 (45)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuations: Items 1 (99), 2 (86), 3 (76)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valuations: Items 5 (85), 6 (68), 4 (33)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest valuations: Items 0 (94), 1 (87), 8 (65)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 4.

6. Agent 5:
   - Highest valuations: Items 5 (86), 4 (85), 7 (73)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 5.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 4 (second-highest valuation after Item 0).
- Allocate Item 7 to Agent 5 (highest remaining valuation after Item 4).
- Allocate Item 8 to Agent 0 (highest remaining valuation after Item 1).

Now we have allocated all 9 items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent is considered according to their preferences, and all items are distributed.
