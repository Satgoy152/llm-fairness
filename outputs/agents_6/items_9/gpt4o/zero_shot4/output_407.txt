Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58   3  90  57  47  26  44  67   3
1  42   9  48  73  29  60  83  53  20
2  92  16  44  23  30  32  47  33  31
3  18  81   6  32   0   9  98  26  28
4  70  78  88  59  53  24   7  25  20
5  32  72  52  88  36  89  59   1  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that aims to maximize the total value for each agent. We'll allocate each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 92.
Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 81.
Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 90.
Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 73.
Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 53.
Item 5: Agent 5 values it the most at 89.
Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 98, but Agent 3 has already received an item, so we consider the next highest, Agent 5 at 59.
Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 67.
Item 8: Agent 5 values it the most at 85, but Agent 5 has already received items, so we consider the next highest, Agent 0 at 3 (since all other agents have items).
Now, let's check the allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and exactly 9 items are allocated.

Allocations:

Agent 0: [2, 7]
Agent 1: [3]
Agent 2: [0]
Agent 3: [1]
Agent 4: [4]
Agent 5: [5, 6, 8]
Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6, 8]
}
```
