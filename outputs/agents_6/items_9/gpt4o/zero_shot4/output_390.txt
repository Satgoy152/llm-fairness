Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  53  34  69   9   2  80  94  60
1  58  18  46  27  99  39  81  93  41
2  32  40  40  13  53  75  94  17  51
3  41   5  25  33  48  55  53  93   8
4  63  94  12  36  47  46  71  14  93
5  64  72  17  69  72  27  16  56  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of all agents. One approach is to use a method that considers the valuations of each agent for the items and attempts to assign items where their valuation is the highest.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate that item to the respective agent if it's still available.
3. Continue this process until all items have been allocated or all agents have received a fair number of items.
4. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Following this approach, here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (94), so assign item 7 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (99), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (94), so assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (93), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5 (55), so assign item 5 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (94), so assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 8 the highest (73), so assign item 8 to agent 5.

Now, we have remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 9. Let's distribute these remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0, who values it highly (85).
- Assign item 2 to agent 1, with a good value (46).
- Assign item 3 to agent 4, as no other agent has a particularly high value for it.

After the allocation, each agent should have at least one item, and all items should be assigned. 

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": [8]
}
```
