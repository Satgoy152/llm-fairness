Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11   7  47  60  40  83  23  13  50
1  13  18  97  19  28  19  16   1  66
2  84  23  37  18  53  71  54  19  60
3   7  58  34   0  94  54  78  25  33
4  18  23  34  23  16  31  92  68   6
5  41  90  90  43  80  20  94  97   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [41 90 90 43 80 20 94 97  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Given the valuations matrix, we will try to allocate items to agents who value them the most while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 5** values item 7 at 97, and this is the highest valuation for any item by any agent. Assign item 7 to agent 5.

2. **Agent 1** values item 2 at 97, which is the highest remaining valuation for any item. Assign item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 3** values item 4 at 94, which is the next highest remaining valuation. Assign item 4 to agent 3.

4. **Agent 5** also values item 6 at 94. Assign item 6 to agent 5.

5. **Agent 2** values item 0 at 84. Assign item 0 to agent 2.

6. **Agent 0** values item 5 at 83. Assign item 5 to agent 0.

7. **Agent 5** values item 1 at 90. Assign item 1 to agent 5.

8. **Agent 4** values item 6 at 92, which was already allocated to agent 5. Next, agent 4 values item 7 at 68, but it was allocated to agent 5. So, assign item 3 to agent 4, which is the highest remaining value.

9. **Agent 4** also values item 8 at 6, which is the remaining unallocated item. Assign item 8 to agent 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 8],
    "5": [6, 7, 1]
}
```
