Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  98  67  41  45  84  75  92  66
1  25  25  68  72  60  81  85  44  22
2  57  30  83  43  95  12  69  41  17
3  67  66  61  81  45  51  36  65  88
4  59  33  13  14  33  90  22  31  46
5  50  82  17  88  78  86  80  37  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total sum of allocated items is exactly 9. One approach to achieve this is to assign the items in a way that considers the agents' valuations to maximize fairness.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [1, 7] (since they have high valuations for these items)
- Agent 1 gets items: [5, 6] (similarly, high valuations for these)
- Agent 2 gets items: [4] (high valuation for item 4)
- Agent 3 gets items: [3, 8] (items with reasonable valuations)
- Agent 4 gets items: [] (no items allocated, as other agents have higher individual valuations)
- Agent 5 gets items: [0, 2] (items with reasonable valuations)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly, considering the valuations of each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```
