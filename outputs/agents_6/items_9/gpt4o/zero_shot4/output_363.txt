Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  47  63  83  31  62  63  93  43
1  39  49   8  53  27  66  27  70  43
2  89  93  78  89  18  69  68  77  98
3  94  67  78  72  64   4  55  31  27
4  66  90  22  12  96  45  98  44  77
5  26  16  51  71  42  51  56  30  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that the total value that each agent receives is as balanced as possible. We will also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed among the agents. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value for each item for all agents and try to balance the distribution so that each agent has a fair share of value.
2. Assign items to agents by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring fairness.

Based on the valuations provided in the table, here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Items [8]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 5: Items [2, 5]

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 9. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
