Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41   8  36  30  77  98  96  23  29
1  14  11  49   6  26  44  44  23  11
2  93  88   4  78  93  28  79   1  26
3  22  23  28  21  49  15  81  65  50
4  91  28  22  50  40  78   0  48  95
5  18  15  34  42   3  77  91  98  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure each agent gets at least one item. This can be a complex optimization problem, but for simplicity, I'll distribute the items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
2. After this initial assignment, distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 8 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 7 the most.

After this initial assignment, we have the following items left: [1, 3, 4].

We can assign these remaining items based on the next highest valuation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (77).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (88).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (50).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's the final JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8, 3],
    "5": [7]
}
```
