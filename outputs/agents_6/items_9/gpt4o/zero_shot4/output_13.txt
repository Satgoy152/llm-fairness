Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  10  11  50  99  84  40  67   1
1  30  46  44  40  60  11  28  35  45
2  16  22  28  81  60   3  85  74  99
3   4  77  50  75  82  66  23  61  33
4  78  64  77  76  26  93  83  58  30
5  87  82  59  66  58  73  37  79   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total allocation consists of exactly 9 items. One possible approach is to assign items based on maximizing the total valuations for each agent.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Agent 0: Assign the item that has the highest value for Agent 0.
2. Agent 1: Assign items that have relatively high value for Agent 1.
3. Agent 2: Assign items that have relatively high value for Agent 2.
4. Agent 3: Assign items that have relatively high value for Agent 3.
5. Agent 4: Assign items that have relatively high value for Agent 4.
6. Agent 5: Assign items that have relatively high value for Agent 5.

Following this logic and ensuring a fair spread:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 99).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 44) and item 8 (value 45).
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (value 85) and item 7 (value 74).
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 77).
- Agent 4 gets item 5 (value 93).
- Agent 5 gets item 0 (value 87) and item 3 (value 66).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
