Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  21   4  70  81  98  17  91  65
1  11  36  24  66  79  96  65  86  64
2  80  40  85  69  17  20  68  94  23
3  71  97  16  16  78  17  42  59  54
4  90  99  80  98  50  67  17  50  26
5  94  85  26  78  95  75  10   0  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all 9 items are allocated. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Identify the highest value each agent places on the items and prioritize allocating those items to the respective agents.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item by considering the next highest available valued item for an agent who doesn't have any items yet.
3. Distribute the remaining items to optimize total value for each agent.

Let's allocate the items based on the above strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (98).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (96).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (94).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (97).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (99).
- Agent 5 values item 0 the highest (94).

Now, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets items 5 and 4 (value: 98 + 81 = 179).
2. Agent 1 gets items 8 and 6 (value: 64 + 65 = 129).
3. Agent 2 gets items 7 and 2 (value: 94 + 85 = 179).
4. Agent 3 gets item 1 (value: 97).
5. Agent 4 gets item 3 (value: 98).
6. Agent 5 gets item 0 (value: 94).

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [8, 6],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, each agent gets at least one item, and the total value is fairly distributed among the agents.
