Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43   1  67   0  75  44   7  76  29
1  11  38  12  86  30  60  17  34  80
2   1  90  68  44  53  58  17  68  83
3  26  61  82  92  33   6  69  61  93
4  46   4  66   2   2   3  49  26  32
5  45  93  44  58  39  65  63  30  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonably equitable share of the total value of items. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing value within the constraints of distributing all items.

Proceeding with this approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 has a strong preference for items 4, 7, and 2.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 8 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 7
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 8
- Agent 4: Items 6
- Agent 5: Items 0, 2, 5

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
