Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  17  17  92  97  14  92  91  11
1  83  56  74  46   4  13  23  81  91
2  26  49  93   9  16  50  37  29   6
3  15  63  41  42   9   7  79  45  76
4  57  91  68  63  61  12   5  73  99
5  66   4   9  67   7  91  19  39   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent is assigned an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Given that there are 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Select items that maximize Agent 0's value. Items 3, 4, and 6 are among the highest value for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Select items that maximize Agent 1's value. Items 0, 2, and 8 are valuable for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Select items that maximize Agent 2's value. Items 2 and 5 are valuable for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Select items that Agent 3 values highly. Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Select items that maximize Agent 4's value. Items 1 and 8 are valuable for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Select items that maximize Agent 5's value. Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 5.

After considering the above possibilities, below is the allocation that ensures all items are distributed and every agent gets a fair share:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 8.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives no items.
- Agent 4 receives items 1 and 7.
- Agent 5 receives items 5 and 6.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all 9 items are allocated, and the allocation attempts to maximize the valuation for each agent.
