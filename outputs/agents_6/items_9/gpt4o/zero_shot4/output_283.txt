Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  37  60  44  44  45  54  33  32
1  27  89  90  93  16  98  78   6  98
2  59  52  55  73  69  79  23  99  82
3  86  52  68  83  94  95  99  76   7
4  78  17  46  53  63  56   0  17  22
5  78  30  39  74  88  33   3  74  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [78 30 39 74 88 33  3 74 98]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim to distribute the items so that each agent has roughly equal total value. Here is one possible allocation:

Agent 0:
- Items: [0, 1] (Total value: 75 + 37 = 112)

Agent 1:
- Items: [2, 5] (Total value: 90 + 98 = 188)

Agent 2:
- Items: [3, 8] (Total value: 73 + 82 = 155)

Agent 3:
- Items: [6] (Total value: 99)

Agent 4:
- Items: [] (Total value: 0)

Agent 5:
- Items: [4, 7] (Total value: 88 + 74 = 162)

This distribution allows each agent to receive at least some value, except agent 4, who unfortunately does not have any items allocated. Now, I will present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 7]
}
```
