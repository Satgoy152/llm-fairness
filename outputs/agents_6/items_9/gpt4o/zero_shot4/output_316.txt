Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  91   5  51  96  64  51  80   3
1  27  69  97  98  63  39  98  92  42
2  15  11  36  82  21  21  55  39  79
3  97   1  13  70  17  22  93  77  53
4   8  28  68  46  71  24  30  30  54
5  62  15  55  25  47  23  66  91  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent or distribute items to balance the overall satisfaction among agents. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent at least one item if possible, based on their highest valuation for an unassigned item.
2. If there are remaining items, allocate them to agents who have the next highest valuation for any unassigned items.

Based on the table and aiming for a balanced allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 8.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4, but since Agent 0 already has it, Agent 4 can have item 2.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 7.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [8]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [1, 5]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
