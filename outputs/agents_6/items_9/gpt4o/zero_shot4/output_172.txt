Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  77  80  12  31  93  30  88  85
1   2  97  92  30  13  85  98  83  23
2  71   0   0  74  85  59  15  81   4
3  46  56  63  18  86  58  80  30   6
4  81  71   1  27  27  60  10  41  66
5  48  55  11  19  34  51  89  44  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuations each agent receives while ensuring each agent can get an integer number of items. Given that we have 9 items and 6 agents, not every agent will receive an item, but we must ensure a fair distribution based on their valuations.

Let's start by considering the maximum valuations for each item and allocating them to agents who value them the most, while also ensuring a fair distribution:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 81 (Agent 4)
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 97 (Agent 1)
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 92 (Agent 1)
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 74 (Agent 2)
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 86 (Agent 3)
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 93 (Agent 0)
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 98 (Agent 1)
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 88 (Agent 0)
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 85 (Agent 0)

Now, let's allocate the selected items to each agent while ensuring all 9 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 6]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [4]
- Agent 4: Item [0]
- Agent 5: No items

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents receive items they value the most. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7, 8],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": []
}
```
