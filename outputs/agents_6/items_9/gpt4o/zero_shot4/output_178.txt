Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  32  34  29  81  24  31  11  20
1  81  93  80  46  71   8  86  22  45
2  60  14  92  44   6  34  63  30  78
3  96  69  28  75  91  71  72  73  14
4  31  28  22  22  61  28  80  18  22
5  44  42  27  32  63  95   5  60  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets a reasonable share. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the item with the highest value to the agent who values it the most.
2. Continue this process while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Make sure the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Following these steps, let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (81).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (93).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (92).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (96).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (80).
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (95).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can also take item 3 (29) as it's one of the highest remaining values for them.
- Agent 3 can take item 7 (73) as it's the next highest value for them.
- Agent 5 can take item 8 (36) as it's the next best value available for them.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents.
