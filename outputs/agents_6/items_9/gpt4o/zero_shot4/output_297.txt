Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  89  10  85   9   4  10  97  82
1  31  43  51  77  83  68  29  59  32
2   0  79  29  38  30  40  99   5  56
3  19  47  35  77  60  65  79  27  28
4   5  13  32  69  30  35  22   6  95
5  36  76  25  90  65  50  75  19  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every agent receives at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation strategy, where we prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most, then proceed to allocate remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 7 (value 97)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (value 83)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 6 (value 99)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 (value 77)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 8 (value 95)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 (value 50)

Now, distribute the remaining items, focusing on maximizing the total value:

7. **Agent 0**: Item 1 (value 89)
8. **Agent 1**: Item 2 (value 51)
9. **Agent 5**: Item 0 (value 36)

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while trying to maximize each agent's valuation.
