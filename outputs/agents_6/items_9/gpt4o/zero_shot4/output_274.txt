Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  51   3   7  74   2  66  67  42
1   1  72   8  99  20  46  36  61  14
2   2  72  16  31  35  87  67  77  97
3   1  34  69   8  16  63  46  20  11
4  97  47  68  27  59  60  47  66  50
5  90  21  75  57  41  25  59  98  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items allocated. One approach is to try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while distributing the items as evenly as possible.

Let's go through a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5]  
   - Valuation: 58 (item 0) + 2 (item 5) = 60

2. **Agent 1**: Items [3]  
   - Valuation: 99 (item 3) = 99

3. **Agent 2**: Items [8]  
   - Valuation: 97 (item 8) = 97

4. **Agent 3**: Items [2]  
   - Valuation: 69 (item 2) = 69

5. **Agent 4**: Items [4]  
   - Valuation: 59 (item 4) = 59

6. **Agent 5**: Items [1, 6, 7]  
   - Valuation: 21 (item 1) + 59 (item 6) + 98 (item 7) = 178

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, ensures all 9 items are allocated, and balances the values reasonably.

Hereâ€™s the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
