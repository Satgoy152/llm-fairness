Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  14  91  82  72  25  98  61  58
1   1  73  97  31  28  63  36   0  59
2  59  62  51  62  76  25   6  94  95
3  45  33  97  16  81  19  37  16  87
4   6  66  60  96  70  12  28  35  87
5  24  89  10  23  51  92  10  79  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring every item is allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy that considers the agents' preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 6, so we allocate it to them.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 2, so we allocate it to them.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 8, so we allocate it to them.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 2, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 4 to them, which is their next best.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values item 3, so we allocate it to them.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent highly values item 5, so we allocate it to them.

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated. We have allocated 6 items so far, so 3 remain: items 0, 1, and 7. Let's allocate them:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (next highest value after item 6)
- **Agent 1**: Item 7 (next highest value after item 2)
- **Agent 5**: Item 0 (next highest value after item 5)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, and it attempts to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible.
