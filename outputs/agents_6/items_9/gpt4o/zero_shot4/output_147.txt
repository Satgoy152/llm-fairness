Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  55  10  52  85  81  84  30  41
1  56  52  78  20  38  91   3  83  98
2  20  34  12  46  30  43  51  67  25
3  88  76  87  18  95  25  64  35  20
4  88  64  28  98  64  28  58  10  80
5  42  97  77  31  85  10  93  63  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated exactly once.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Items 0, 6  
   - Valuation: 88 (Item 0) + 84 (Item 6) = 172

2. **Agent 1:** Items 5, 8  
   - Valuation: 91 (Item 5) + 98 (Item 8) = 189

3. **Agent 2:** Items 3, 7  
   - Valuation: 46 (Item 3) + 67 (Item 7) = 113

4. **Agent 3:** Item 4  
   - Valuation: 95 (Item 4) = 95

5. **Agent 4:** Item 2  
   - Valuation: 28 (Item 2) = 28

6. **Agent 5:** Item 1  
   - Valuation: 97 (Item 1) = 97

This allocation ensures that each item is given to an agent, maximizing the total value for each agent. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
