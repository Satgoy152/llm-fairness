Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  55   1  86  23  50  55  93  23
1  42  63  79  78  58  62  56   5  27
2  58  21  16  13  25  46   4  93  38
3  83  51  50  68  16  74  83  96  35
4  33   3  17  38  72  17  46  86  40
5  85  22  16  13   2  89  47  43  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a similar total value based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation of 93 for item 7, and decent values for items 3 and 1. Allocate items 7, 3, and 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 and a decent valuation for item 8. Allocate items 0 and 8 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Has a high valuation for item 6 and also values item 4 decently. Allocate items 6 and 4 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Has a high valuation for item 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Has no items allocated yet, and we have already allocated 9 items, leaving agent 5 with no items.

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [6, 4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and, as much as possible, maximizes their total valuation with a fair distribution of items.
