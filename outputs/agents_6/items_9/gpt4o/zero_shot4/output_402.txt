Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  42  49  24   8  69  22  77  45
1  81  91  61  63  49  26  55  79  94
2  99  82  14  44  24   3  61  66  33
3  37   3  63   7  11  29  30  47   2
4  90  54  49  71  49  93   8  32  27
5  53  12  83  63  10   0   1  11  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and aim for a distribution that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Each agent should ideally receive 1 or 2 items since there are 9 items and 6 agents. 

2. We can start by allocating the items with the highest values to each agent and then distribute the remaining items to balance the allocation.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Highest values are items 0 (80) and 7 (77).
- Agent 1: Highest values are items 8 (94) and 1 (91).
- Agent 2: Highest values are items 0 (99) and 1 (82). Since item 0 is already taken, we allocate item 6 (61).
- Agent 3: Highest value is item 2 (63).
- Agent 4: Highest value is item 5 (93) and 3 (71).
- Agent 5: Highest value is item 2 (83). Since item 2 is already taken, we allocate item 3 (63).

Now, let's adjust to ensure each agent gets items and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [0, 7]
- Agent 1: [8, 1]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [5, 4]
- Agent 5: [3]

This ensures that all 9 items are allocated fairly. Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
