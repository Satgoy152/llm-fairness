Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5   3  11  41  53  76  32  39  43
1  94  84  35  80  85  31  17  20  14
2  27  49  43  40   4  33  36  32   7
3  40  85  10   3  21  63  95  77  65
4  22  56  48  31  22  11  28  18  15
5  60  33  22  94  91  93  93  64  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Since there are 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will have more items than others.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

After analyzing the table:

- Agent 0 can be given items with moderate to high value for them.
- Agent 1 tends to have higher valuations across several items.
- Agent 2 has relatively lower values, so fewer or less valued items should be allocated to them.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for specific items.
- Agent 4 has moderate valuations.
- Agent 5 has high valuations for certain items too.

Here's a fair allocation based on the above analysis:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures every item is assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Note that agents 2 and 4 receive no items, which is permissible under the constraints provided.
