Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  31  41  48  67  57  76  93  55
1  65  73  59  71   7  49  13  77  62
2  93  77  58  74  33  61  12  77  47
3  89  26  90  14  41  44  28  58  92
4  66  56  13  48  46  27  89  25  63
5  77  57  80  52  58  85  23  78  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuations each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 6 agents and 9 items, not every agent will receive an item. 

First, let's evaluate the possible allocations based on the given valuations to maximize the overall satisfaction:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest value items: 7 (93), 6 (76)
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value items: 1 (73), 3 (71)
   
3. Agent 2:
   - Highest value items: 0 (93), 3 (74)
   
4. Agent 3:
   - Highest value items: 2 (90), 8 (92)
   
5. Agent 4:
   - Highest value items: 6 (89), 4 (46)
   
6. Agent 5:
   - Highest value items: 5 (85), 2 (80)

Now, considering these preferences and ensuring fair distribution, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [7]
- Agent 1: Items [1]
- Agent 2: Items [0]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 8]
- Agent 4: Items [6]
- Agent 5: Items [3, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures every item is assigned to one agent, and it maximizes the agents' valuations based on their highest preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
