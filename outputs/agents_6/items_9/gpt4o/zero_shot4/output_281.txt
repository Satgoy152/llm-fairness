Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  75  85  57  84  55   5  37  13
1  97  87  39  96  84  69  96  92   0
2  74  60  19  31  44  44  19  69  21
3  27  53  41  90  30   5  91   0   4
4  15  52  49  63  24   4  84  88  54
5   6  19  37  67  46  11  66  64  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations for each item and aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Allocate high-value items first:** Begin by assigning the highest-valued items to the agents who value them most.
2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item:** If possible, distribute items so that each agent receives at least one item, though this may not always be feasible depending on the distribution of valuations.
3. **Maximize total valuation:** Try to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their total valuation, considering the constraints.

Considering the above strategy, here's a suggested allocation:
- Agent 0 values items 2, 1, and 4 highly.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2's highest value is for item 0.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 3 highly.

Based on these observations, the allocation could look like this:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation by Agent 0)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation by Agent 1)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest valuation by Agent 3)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (highest valuation by Agent 4)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation by Agent 0)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation by Agent 1)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5 (highest available valuation for Agent 5)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (second-highest valuation by Agent 4)
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (highest available valuation for Agent 2)

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7, 6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents based on the highest possible valuations for each item by the respective agents.
