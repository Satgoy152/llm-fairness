Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32   6  29   5  30  80   1  61   6
1  63  81  34  90   3  31  11  53  11
2  83  77  63  13  56  23  81  89  79
3  29  35  37   2  78  73  25  87  22
4  62  40  61  86  18  98  33  61  50
5   2  78  32  11  71  80  56  11   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's approach it by assigning items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is maximized, while also ensuring each item is assigned only once and each agent gets a roughly equal number of items.

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Assign items to agents by maximizing the value of the items assigned to each agent.

Using this approach, here are the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [7]
- Agent 3: Items [5]
- Agent 4: Items [2, 8]
- Agent 5: Items [6]

Now, I'll present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 8],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
