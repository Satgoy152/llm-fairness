Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  64  70  48  51  18  97  27  56
1  74  51  98  13  94  82  64  51  64
2  81  72  57   3  38  97  26   6   0
3  70  69  91  99  41  97  34  88  29
4  43   2  60  60  97  83  39  29  59
5  51  18  82   0  37  38  78  52  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and exactly nine items are allocated overall. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 the highest at 97.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the highest at 98.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 the highest at 97.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the highest at 99.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 4 the highest at 97.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 6 the highest at 78, but item 6 is already assigned. The next highest value is item 2 at 82, but itâ€™s already assigned to agent 1. The next highest value is item 7 at 52.

Now, let's allocate the remaining unassigned items:

- Items 0, 1, and 8 need to be assigned. We will allocate them to agents based on their next highest valuations.
  
  - **Agent 0**: Assign item 0, valued at 35.
  - **Agent 1**: Assign item 1, valued at 51.
  - **Agent 3**: Assign item 8, valued at 29.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents with each agent receiving at least one item.
