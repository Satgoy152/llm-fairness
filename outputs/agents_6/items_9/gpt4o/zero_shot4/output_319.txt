Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  86  50  21  45  11  13  47  52
1  18  86  77  33  40  10  55  52  86
2  41  92  67  63  57  73  73  70   3
3  87  73   6  50  65  76  56  97  23
4  97  17  99  62  57  58  21  90  89
5  14  71  69  34  80  40  86  22  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that they value highly, and all items are allocated. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive one item, and others will receive two items.

Here is a possible allocation based on the agents' valuations:

- Assign items to the agent who values them the most, keeping track of the number of items each agent receives.
- If there's a tie, or if an agent has already received the maximum number of items they can have, consider giving the item to the next highest valuing agent who has not reached their limit.

Here's an allocation that satisfies these criteria:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 0]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives item 1, as they value it quite highly compared to other items they could receive.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 8, maximizing their overall valuation.
- Agent 2 gets items 5 and 6, which they value reasonably well.
- Agent 3 is given item 7, which they value very highly.
- Agent 4 receives item 4, which they have a decent valuation for.
- Agent 5 gets items 3 and 0, making it a fair distribution of items.

This allocation ensures all 9 items are allocated across the 6 agents in a way that reflects their preferences as much as possible.
