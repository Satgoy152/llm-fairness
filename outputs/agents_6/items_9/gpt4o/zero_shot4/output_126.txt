Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  91  38  39  68  28  82  54   0
1  17  74  57  91   0  15  80   8  52
2   4  86  81   4  82   7  75  90   1
3  92  93  47  11  74  21  37  83  46
4  69  84  35  77  23  64   7  36  81
5  44  62  64  43  93  40  16   5  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent gets, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (since we have 9 items and 6 agents). One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items based on the highest valuation an agent has for an unallocated item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value: 93, highest single valuation).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value: 91, next highest valuation).
3. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value: 90, next highest valuation).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 5 (value: 93, next highest valuation).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value: 81, next highest valuation).
6. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value: 82, next highest valuation).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 4 (value: 64, next highest valuation).
8. Assign item 8 to agent 5 (value: 89, next highest valuation).
9. Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value: 92, next highest valuation).

This ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4, 8]
}
```
