Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  73  38  67  80  49  34  25  26
1  34  42  30  37  27  22   0  93  12
2  66  37  95  98  61  43  50  38  60
3  39  64  54  44  54  28  68  75  13
4   2  82  13  92  78  20  63  88  37
5  29   5  76  11  80  55  53  85  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to ensure that each agent receives the items they value the most, while keeping the total number of allocated items exactly at 9. Let's evaluate the agents' valuations and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: 14, 73, 38, 67, 80, 49, 34, 25, 26
   - Highest values: 80 (item 4), 73 (item 1)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: 34, 42, 30, 37, 27, 22, 0, 93, 12
   - Highest value: 93 (item 7)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: 66, 37, 95, 98, 61, 43, 50, 38, 60
   - Highest values: 98 (item 3), 95 (item 2)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: 39, 64, 54, 44, 54, 28, 68, 75, 13
   - Highest value: 75 (item 7)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Values: 2, 82, 13, 92, 78, 20, 63, 88, 37
   - Highest values: 92 (item 3), 88 (item 7)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Values: 29, 5, 76, 11, 80, 55, 53, 85, 45
   - Highest values: 85 (item 7), 80 (item 4)

From these evaluations, we make decisions to allocate items to agents while ensuring no item is allocated more than once:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as a second choice.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (highest value).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 as a second choice.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (highest available value).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5 (second-highest choice after item 7, which is assigned to Agent 1).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (best available choice).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3 (next best available choice).

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
