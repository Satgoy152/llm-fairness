Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  34  35  75  88  57   0  26  82
1  68  14  70  41  60  14  59  15  74
2  57  45  49  67  92   6  50  59  71
3  45   3  24  10  45  38  40  20  90
4  10  28  28  92   9  44  24  19  22
5  52   5  75   2  35  95  52  67  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and only nine items are allocated in total. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to maximize satisfaction.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's consider the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4, so we can give them these items.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2, so they can receive this item.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly, but since it's already taken, we can give them item 8, which they also value highly.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 8, but since it's already taken, we can give them item 3 or 7, which they value moderately.
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly, but since it's already taken, we can give them item 6, which they value moderately.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly, so they can take this item.

After considering these allocations and ensuring every agent receives at least one item, we can finalize the allocations as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all nine items are distributed.
