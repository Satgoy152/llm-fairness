Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  69  70  67  91  56  52  18  45
1   4  94  60  85  11  15  53  86  69
2  80  42  89  14  85  74  43  60  42
3  44  77   5  45  35  69  65  74   0
4   4  85  92  48  25  60  73  48   4
5  21  24  70  28  58  41  19  43  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Based on the valuations provided, we can follow these steps to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 4 (91) and 2 (70).
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 1 (94) and 3 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 2 (89) and 4 (85). However, since item 2 is already taken by Agent 0, we can assign item 5 (74) instead.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a relatively high valuation for item 7 (74).
5. **Agent 4**: Has high valuations for item 2 (92) but since item 2 is already taken by Agent 0, we can assign item 6 (73).
6. **Agent 5**: Should get the remaining items as evenly as possible.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [4, 2]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 3]
- **Agent 2**: [5]
- **Agent 3**: [7]
- **Agent 4**: [6]
- **Agent 5**: [0, 8]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
