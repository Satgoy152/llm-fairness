Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  29  57  85  47  52   1  47  52
1  92  50  90  49  57  51  74  65  65
2  73  41  72  76  63  15  60  31  18
3  34  35  71  91  43   5  21  49  87
4  18  60  71  43  67  15  47  60   2
5  51   6  32  99  71  90  65  25  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocations maximize the total value for each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Distribute items to agents to maximize their individual total value while ensuring every item is allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 very highly (85) compared to other items. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 very highly (92). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (72). Assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 8 highly (87). Assign item 8 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly (67). Assign item 4 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly (90). Assign item 5 to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and we need to allocate 3 more items. Let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has item 3, but can also take item 1, which they value second highest (29).
- Agent 1 has item 0, and can take item 6, which they value (74).
- Agent 5 can take item 7, which they value (25).

Now, all 9 items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```
