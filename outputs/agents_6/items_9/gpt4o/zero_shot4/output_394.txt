Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  14  94  63  24   8  76  88  50
1  93  22  94  56  85   2  89  25  46
2  52  79  44  63  71  92  85  27  41
3  17  89  67  10  52  51  14  13  42
4  19  12   7  24  79  85  16  13  79
5  37  19  45  85  50  68  36  14  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Given there are 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. However, we will try to ensure that the overall allocation is as fair as possible.

One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible, and then distributing the remaining items in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (Value: 93)
   - Item 1: Agent 3 (Value: 89)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (Value: 94)
   - Item 3: Agent 5 (Value: 85)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (Value: 85)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (Value: 92)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (Value: 89)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (Value: 88)
   - Item 8: Agent 4 (Value: 79)

2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, and redistribute if necessary:
   - Agent 0: [2, 7]
   - Agent 1: [0, 4, 6]
   - Agent 2: [5]
   - Agent 3: [1]
   - Agent 4: [8]
   - Agent 5: [3]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents receive items they value highly.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [3]
}
```
