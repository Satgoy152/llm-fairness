Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  84  46  83  86  78  71  76  45
1  81  79  91  42  82  25  44  86  68
2  48  80  59  88  98  22  13  59  66
3  93  33  75  57   5  37  99   5  94
4   8  65  99  26  37   5  41  72  54
5  68  61   0  39   1  54  18  47   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's approach this by maximizing the total value assigned to each agent, considering their respective valuations for each item. We'll try to assign items based on the highest individual valuation first, ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (98).
2. **Item 6**: Highest valuation by agent 3 (99).
3. **Item 8**: Highest valuation by agent 3 (94).
4. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by agent 4 (99).
5. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (88).
6. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (84).
7. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by agent 3 (93).
8. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (78).
9. **Item 7**: Next highest valuation by agent 1 (86).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Items 0, 6, 8
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: No items

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 6, 8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents while maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their highest available valuations.
