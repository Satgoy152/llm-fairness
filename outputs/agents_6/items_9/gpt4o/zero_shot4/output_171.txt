Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46   0  44  87  60  73  51  82  89
1  49  20  18  78   2  14  78  98  43
2  64   2  38   9  61  55  23  45  25
3  27   8  58  41  51  72  72  94  44
4   9  52  99  41  77  55  46   7  41
5  90   9  46  66   9  57  27  84  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 8 (value 89) and item 3 (value 87) for a total value of 176.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7 (value 98) and item 6 (value 78) for a total value of 176.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (value 64) for a total value of 64.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 (value 72) for a total value of 72.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 (value 99) for a total value of 99.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 1 (value 9) and item 4 (value 9) for a total value of 18.

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is fairly balanced based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```
