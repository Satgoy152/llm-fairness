Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  66  72  81  92  42  96  78  83
1  89  56  52  80  40  67  32  69  82
2  36  99   4  29  77  58  17  73   2
3  62  77  65  46  23  90  50  72  19
4  74  30  93  76  83  41   3  51  47
5  74  60  80  29  54  74   7   1  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuations first. Each item should be assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: `[99, 66, 72, 81, 92, 42, 96, 78, 83]`
   - Highest values: Item 0 (99), Item 6 (96)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: `[89, 56, 52, 80, 40, 67, 32, 69, 82]`
   - Highest value: Item 3 (80)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: `[36, 99, 4, 29, 77, 58, 17, 73, 2]`
   - Highest value: Item 1 (99)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: `[62, 77, 65, 46, 23, 90, 50, 72, 19]`
   - Highest value: Item 5 (90)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values: `[74, 30, 93, 76, 83, 41, 3, 51, 47]`
   - Highest value: Item 2 (93)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Values: `[74, 60, 80, 29, 54, 74, 7, 1, 66]`
   - Highest value: Item 8 (66)

Now, we need to ensure that all 9 items are allocated. We have already allocated 7 items, so we need to allocate 2 more items.

- Item 4: Highest remaining value is by Agent 0 (92)
- Item 7: Highest remaining value is by Agent 0 (78)

Now, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
