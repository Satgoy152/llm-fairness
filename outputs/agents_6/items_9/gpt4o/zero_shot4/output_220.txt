Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  43  47  88  99  18  77  87  45
1  64  64  49  41  78  73  54  98  57
2  11  17  14   6  84   5  65   4  29
3  91  74  45  38  56  67  35  71  78
4  92  67  64  82   3  81  36  36  26
5  30  60   1  42  45  21  89  76   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for a balanced distribution. One common method for such allocation is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (92).
2. Item 1: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (74).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (47).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (88).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (84).
6. Item 5: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (81), but since Agent 4 already has an item, Agent 1 has the next highest valuation (73).
7. Item 6: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (89).
8. Item 7: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (98).
9. Item 8: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (78).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9. Additionally, it respects the preference of each agent by generally assigning items to the agent who values them the most.
