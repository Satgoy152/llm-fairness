Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  14  61  12   3  70  64  62  99
1  84  38  78  41  34  10  40  67  75
2  61  81  78  59  64  55  94  93  65
3  81   2  74   2  63  12  25  50  54
4  58  17  19  27  90  51  54  49  71
5  62  19  76   4  20  21  54  13  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 9 items distributed in total. We will aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness across allocations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Highest value item is 99 (item 8).
2. Agent 1: Highest value item is 84 (item 0).
3. Agent 2: Highest value item is 94 (item 6).
4. Agent 3: Next available high-value item is 81 (item 3).
5. Agent 4: Highest value item is 90 (item 4).
6. Agent 5: Highest value item is 76 (item 2).

Now, to ensure all items are allocated:

- Reallocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 81 for Agent 2).
- Reallocate item 5 to Agent 0 (value 70 for Agent 0).
- Reallocate item 7 to Agent 1 (value 67 for Agent 1).

This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated fairly.
