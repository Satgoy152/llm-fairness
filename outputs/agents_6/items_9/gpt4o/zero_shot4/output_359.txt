Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29   0  68  20  74  58  18  15  32
1  27  52  38  24  83  28  47  50  81
2  29  38  75   8  49  13   8  68  35
3  67  22  58  18  84  18  42   9  44
4  57  86  68  31  36  50  33  22  35
5  61  72   0  81  81  32  56  42  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We have 9 items and 6 agents, so some agents will get more items than others. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (74), 2 (68)
   - Allocate items [4, 2] to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (83), 8 (81)
   - Allocate items [4, 8] to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (75), 7 (68)
   - Allocate items [2, 7] to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (84), 0 (67)
   - Allocate item [4] to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued item: 1 (86)
   - Allocate item [1] to Agent 4

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (81), 4 (81)
   - Allocate items [3] to Agent 5
   
Now, let's look at the allocation and ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. 

However, we might have duplicates in the above allocation, and we should ensure that no item is allocated to more than one agent. Let's finalize the allocation to make sure each item is assigned once and all 9 items are allocated:

- Allocate items based on the highest valuation that hasn't been allocated to another agent yet.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: [4, 2]
- Agent 1: [8]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [3, 5, 6]

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
