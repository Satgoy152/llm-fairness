Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  35  93  94  33  43  59  32  66
1  37  89  97  74  11  99  52  60  13
2  55  42   6  11  71  34  79  32  78
3  20  54  63  25  72  82  81  44  25
4  79  82  59  87   8  13  91  34  82
5  30  21  40  61  35   8  67  96  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated, we can aim for a distribution that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Here's one such fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Gets items with the highest values for them.
- Agent 1: Similarly, gets items that they value highly.
- Agent 2, 3, 4, 5: Same strategy applies.

One possible fair allocation could be as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 5, 1
- Agent 2: Item 8
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 4, 7
- Agent 5: Item 0

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [0]
}
``` 

This allocation should fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations.
