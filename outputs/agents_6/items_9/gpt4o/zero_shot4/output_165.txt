Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91   0  31  13  17  39  24  35   4
1  86  12  75  91  92  58   4  31  63
2  51  66  91  41  41  85  90  69  42
3  61  52  91  68  50  81  62  46  18
4  90  71  60  75  71  65  83  70   5
5   1   4  42  98  60  63  34   0  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all 9 items are allocated. Below is a possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent their highest-value available item one by one.
2. Continue assigning the highest remaining value items to agents until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Start by giving each agent their highest value item:
  - Agent 0: Item 0 (Value: 91)
  - Agent 1: Item 4 (Value: 92)
  - Agent 2: Item 6 (Value: 90)
  - Agent 3: Item 2 (Value: 91)
  - Agent 4: Item 0 (Value: 90)
  - Agent 5: Item 3 (Value: 98)

- Now, reassign items that have been allocated to multiple agents:
  - Reassign Item 0 to Agent 0 (as it’s their highest, and Agent 4 has other high-value items available).
  - Agent 4 can get Item 1 (Value: 71), which is next highest and not allocated yet.

- Each agent has one item now. Allocate remaining items based on highest remaining values:

  - Remaining items: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
  - Agent 0 has Item 0; assign them no more items.
  - Agent 1 has Item 4; assign them no more items.
  - Agent 2 has Item 6; assign them Item 5 (Value: 85, next highest).
  - Agent 3 has Item 2; assign them no more items.
  - Agent 4 has Item 1; assign them Item 7 (Value: 70, next highest).
  - Agent 5 has Item 3; assign them Item 8 (Value: 25, remaining item).

Here’s the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed fairly, maximizing the total value for each agent.
