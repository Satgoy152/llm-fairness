Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72   0  74  41  55  57  29  26   2
1  59  57  64  83  91  40  72  96   5
2   8  86  92  86  49  96  30  12  24
3   3  49  47  99  33   1  99  34  23
4  68  53  13  53  78  46  53  80  52
5   0  56   5  99  76  84   6  24  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. However, given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated, this requires a strategic approach to balance high-value allocations among agents.

Let's attempt a fair and balanced allocation based on the given table:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value item 2 highly.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 7.
3. **Agent 2** values items 5 and 2.
4. **Agent 3** values items 3 and 6.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 3.

Taking these into account, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: [2] - Allocating item 2 as it has the highest value for agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: [4, 7] - Allocating items 4 and 7 based on high values.
- **Agent 2**: [1, 5] - Allocating items 1 and 5 based on high values.
- **Agent 3**: [3, 6] - Allocating items 3 and 6 based on high values.
- **Agent 4**: [0] - Allocating item 0, as it is a reasonable value.
- **Agent 5**: [8] - Allocating item 8, as it is less valued by others.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8]
}
```
