Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  22   9  16  35  34  71  24  65
1   5  39  72  48  48  40  10  94  94
2  21  67  36  95  20  90   9  99   2
3   0  99   1  91  61  56  32  19  32
4  43  96  12  21  89  53  54  74  42
5  68  46  62  29  24  95  25  36  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 6 agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation maximizes their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets approximately the same number of items. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive 2 items and others will receive 1 item.

Here's an allocation strategy:

1. Identify key high-value items for each agent.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated, respecting the total of 9 items.
3. Try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Below is a proposal for allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 8. (Values: 34, 65)
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 7. (Values: 48, 94)
- Agent 2 receives item 6. (Value: 9)
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 4. (Values: 99, 61)
- Agent 4 receives item 0. (Value: 43)
- Agent 5 receives item 2. (Value: 62)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Total value = 99
- Agent 1: Total value = 142
- Agent 2: Total value = 9
- Agent 3: Total value = 160
- Agent 4: Total value = 43
- Agent 5: Total value = 62

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```
