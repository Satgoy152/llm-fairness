Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  37  35  86  82  75  69  77  34
1   3   4   4  48  78  55  18  77   7
2  70  39  83   7  46   0  76   4  98
3  64  10  27  20  50  83  37  67  90
4   9  91  70  62   8  46  75   8  99
5  42  29  58  45   8  98  67  38  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is balanced based on the values provided. Our goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has a high value for item 3 (86).
2. **Agent 1** has a high value for item 4 (78).
3. **Agent 2** has a high value for item 8 (98).
4. **Agent 3** has a high value for item 5 (83).
5. **Agent 4** has a high value for item 1 (91).
6. **Agent 5** has a high value for item 6 (67).

Now we have to allocate the remaining items 0, 2, and 7.

7. **Agent 0** also has a good value for item 0 (26).
8. **Agent 4** also has a good value for item 7 (8).
9. **Agent 2** also has a good value for item 2 (83).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [8, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is 9.
