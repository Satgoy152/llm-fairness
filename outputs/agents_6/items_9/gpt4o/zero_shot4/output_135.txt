Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77   5  51  58  50  81  42   8  54
1  94  46  95  64  45  83  82  35  85
2  54  57  51   0  93   1  72  68  14
3  23  37  15  30  41  24   2   4  32
4  17  70  96   8  27  62  51  86  23
5  27  96  77  88  80   0  88   3  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed.

Based on the provided valuations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 8.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 3 does not have high valuations but can take item 6, which is relatively low-valued for others.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 7.
- Agent 5 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.

This leads to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
