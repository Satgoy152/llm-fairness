Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  89  13  56  99  49   3  70  36
1  35  32  41  98  93  85  44  66  66
2  84  31  75  82  31  13  23  49  61
3  48  48  28  64  84  71  56  14  96
4   2  11  44   9  79  65  86  88   2
5  90  34  23  38  48  81  28   1  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We should aim to distribute items such that each agent gets a reasonable share considering their valuations.

Let's start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent receives an integer number of items. We can try to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Continue this process, trying to ensure that each agent receives one item before any agent receives two, and so on, while maximizing individual agent value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value is item 4 (99).
- Agent 1: Highest value is item 3 (98).
- Agent 2: Highest value is item 0 (84).
- Agent 3: Highest value is item 8 (96).
- Agent 4: Highest value is item 6 (86).
- Agent 5: Highest value is item 0 (90), but it's already taken, so next highest is item 5 (81).

After the first pass, agents 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have one item each. Now let's allocate the remaining items (0, 2, 7) with a focus on balancing value:

- Agent 0: Next highest is item 1 (89).
- Agent 4: Next highest is item 7 (88).
- Agent 5: Next highest is item 2 (23).

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated:

1. Agent 0: [4, 1]
2. Agent 1: [3]
3. Agent 2: [0]
4. Agent 3: [8]
5. Agent 4: [6, 7]
6. Agent 5: [5, 2]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item, with an emphasis on maximizing individual agent values.

The allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [5, 2]
}
```
