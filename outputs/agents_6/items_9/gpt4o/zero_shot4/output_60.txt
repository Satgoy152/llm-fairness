Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  36  81  49  69  11  78   9  12
1  37  77  62  11  72  82  89  33  84
2  24  65  53  14  15  68  48  12  36
3  45  61  67  90   3  89  15   0  76
4   7  29  85  58  90  78  32  57  89
5  37  14  14   9  95  89  55  55  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent ends up with at least some items. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll try to ensure fairness by distributing items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to agents who value them most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
3. Distribute the remaining items in such a way that balances the overall satisfaction.

Below is a fair allocation based on the provided table:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution attempts to maximize the agents' valuations per item assigned.
