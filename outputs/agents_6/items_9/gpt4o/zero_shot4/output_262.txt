Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  35  69  38  19  26  27  26  99
1  72  51   0  11  54  38   1  13  22
2  21  64  29  46  90  26  37  35  13
3  39  38  28  21  74  49  87  13  84
4  80  65  84  15  95  10   4  13  80
5  27  47  71  87  86  25  33  29  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent should ideally receive an equal or nearly equal number of items, given there are 6 agents and 9 items. This means some agents will receive one item, while others will receive two items. We'll also try to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent to ensure a fair distribution based on preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations for items: [21, 35, 69, 38, 19, 26, 27, 26, 99]
   - Highest value items: 8 (99), 2 (69)

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations for items: [72, 51, 0, 11, 54, 38, 1, 13, 22]
   - Highest value items: 0 (72), 1 (51)

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations for items: [21, 64, 29, 46, 90, 26, 37, 35, 13]
   - Highest value items: 4 (90), 1 (64)

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations for items: [39, 38, 28, 21, 74, 49, 87, 13, 84]
   - Highest value items: 6 (87), 8 (84)

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations for items: [80, 65, 84, 15, 95, 10, 4, 13, 80]
   - Highest value items: 4 (95), 2 (84)

6. **Agent 5**: Valuations for items: [27, 47, 71, 87, 86, 25, 33, 29, 25]
   - Highest value items: 3 (87), 4 (86)

Now, we'll allocate items by selecting the highest value items for each agent, ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent.

- Allocate item 8 to Agent 0 (99)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (69)

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (72)

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (90)

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 (87)

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 4 (65)

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 5 (87)

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We have 3 more items to allocate: [5, 7, 9]. Let's distribute these among agents to ensure everyone gets at least one item:

- Allocate item 5 to Agent 5
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0
- Allocate item 9 to Agent 4

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items: [2, 8, 7]
- Agent 1 gets items: [0]
- Agent 2 gets items: [4]
- Agent 3 gets items: [6]
- Agent 4 gets items: [1, 9]
- Agent 5 gets items: [3, 5]

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```
