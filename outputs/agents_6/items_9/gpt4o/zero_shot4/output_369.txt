Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  26  14  10  72  35  83  48   7
1  42  40  15  58  26  64  54  55   6
2  37   8  60  25  25   1  48   3  62
3  26  13  87  22  63   4  46  43  46
4  15  35  17  83  44  18  30   3  77
5  29  63  73  26  60  54  77  17  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to ensure an equitable distribution. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally get 1 or 2 items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest valuations for each item and try to allocate those items to the respective agents.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least 1 item, if possible, and try to balance the distribution based on valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6 (highest valuations: 83, 42)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (highest valuation: 64)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 8 (highest valuations: 60, 62)
- Agent 3: Items 3, 4 (highest valuations: 83, 63)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (highest valuation: 3)
- Agent 5: Item 1 (highest valuation: 63)

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
