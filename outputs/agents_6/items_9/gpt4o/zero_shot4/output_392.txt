Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  31  72   5  48   2  85  90   0
1  39  69   5  64  28  68  57  31  93
2  62  86   8  67  55  93  15   3  87
3  12  31  59  16  89   4  86  89  59
4  70  86  81  13  74   8  78  38  50
5   7  25  87  73  70   0  48  12  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach to assign items to agents. We'll allocate items based on the highest valuation first and ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 7 (value 90)
2. Agent 1: Item 8 (value 93)
3. Agent 2: Item 5 (value 93)
4. Agent 3: Item 4 (value 89)
5. Agent 4: Item 2 (value 81)
6. Agent 5: Item 3 (value 73)
7. Agent 2: Item 1 (value 86)
8. Agent 4: Item 0 (value 70)
9. Agent 0: Item 6 (value 85)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 0],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation strategy tries to maximize fairness by considering the highest value assignments first and ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
