Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  61   9  36  75  76  72  67  61
1  89  11  10  45  54  85   0  60  69
2  70  38  17  54  73  57  62  15  56
3  84  40  38  38  10  37  54  33  58
4  23  39  87  86  56  99  43  91  78
5  10  73  36  35  40  56  77  51  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 11 10 45 54 85  0 60 69]
 [70 38 17 54 73 57 62 15 56]

 [23 39 87 86 56 99 43 91 78]
 [10 73 36 35 40 56 77 51 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent is assigned an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. One approach is to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring fairness. Here's one possible allocation based on the values in the table:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 4 and 5.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 would value item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 can take item 8.
- Agent 4 can take item 2 and item 7.
- Agent 5 can take item 1 and item 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
