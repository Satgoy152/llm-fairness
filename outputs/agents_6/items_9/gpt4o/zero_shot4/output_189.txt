Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  49  58  86  31  55  70  38  50
1  49  91  87  73  11  38  35  10  34
2  45  30  98  25  28  14  66  62  70
3  29   2  64  97  28  89  61  33  20
4  13  35  94  51  93  91  20  43  11
5  24  74  32  74  96  77   5  45  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 6 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, and others will receive only one.

Let's begin by allocating items to the agents based on maximizing their valuations:

1. **Agent 2** is assigned item 2 (value 98) and item 8 (value 70). Agent 2 highly values these items.

2. **Agent 4** is assigned item 4 (value 93). This is the highest-valued item for Agent 4.

3. **Agent 3** is assigned item 3 (value 97). This is the highest-valued item for Agent 3.

4. **Agent 1** is assigned item 1 (value 91). This is the highest-valued item for Agent 1.

5. **Agent 5** is assigned item 5 (value 77) and item 6 (value 5). Agent 5 highly values item 5.

6. **Agent 0** is assigned item 0 (value 40) and item 7 (value 38). These items ensure Agent 0 receives a fair share.

This allocation fairly distributes the items and ensures each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
