Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18   8  14  29  27  18  98  72   4
1  58  26  98   1  33  66  37  29  55
2  69  83  70  32  27   7  41  91  42
3  85  46  42  66  35  27  85  29  40
4  36   6  32  40   8  94  70  89  11
5  58  46  77  43  76  71  84  37  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Since there are more agents than items, some agents will inevitably receive no items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to the agents first.
2. Try to distribute items such that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 98.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 98.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most at 91.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most at 85.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most at 94.
- Agent 5 values item 8 the most at 81.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has item 6, assign item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest value for them).
- Agent 1 has item 2, assign item 1 to Agent 2 (next highest value for them).
- Agent 4 has item 5, assign item 4 to Agent 5 (next highest value for them).

Following this logic, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [8, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and tries to distribute the items fairly based on the highest valuations.
