Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  92  79  77  89  84  82  43  36
1  31  72  98  89  56  53  63  53  24
2  79  96  52  92  36   6  76  10  86
3  48   3  96  95  58  92  79   1   6
4  34  17  32  86   0   0  47  15  92
5  63  60  40  78  86  58  56  39  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction across agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this scenario, each agent will be satisfied based on their valuations of the items they receive.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations by each agent, ensuring no item is assigned more than once and each agent gets an integer number of items.
2. Ensure all 9 items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2.
- Agent 2 values item 8 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 3 and 6.
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly.

Given these observations, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns each item to exactly one agent and uses all 9 items. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation respects the agents' preferences as closely as possible within the constraints.
