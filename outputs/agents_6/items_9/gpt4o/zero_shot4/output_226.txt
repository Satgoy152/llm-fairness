Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  80  67  27  72   8  48  57   4
1  55  62  70   8  94  52  57  88  40
2  23   6  77  76  77  82  44  46  56
3  80  72  64  70  91  73  99  45   9
4  19  80  94  88   8  99  10  53  80
5  40  26  55  38  42  43   6  13  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that have relatively high values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that have relatively high values for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that have relatively high values for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that have relatively high values for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items that have relatively high values for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate items to Agent 5 if there are any items left that are relatively better valued by them.

Considering the valuations provided, an allocation could be as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 2, 7
- Agent 5: Item 1, 3, 8

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [1, 3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents while aiming to respect the valuations provided.
