Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  84  13  43  77  80  64  86  99
1  46  81  97  61   4  88   0  19  31
2  88  96  91  63  32  94  40  40  88
3  10  50  51  86  64  76  14  83  76
4  77  27   2  13   1  27  89  66  45
5  17  66  31  96  66  99  94  77  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Values items 0, 1, 5, 7, and 8 highly. We can assign items 0 and 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 2 the highest at 97. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Values items 1, 5, and 2 highly. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 3 and item 7 highly. We can assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 6 the highest. Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5:** Values item 4 and item 7 highly. Assign items 4 and 7 to Agent 5.

By ensuring each agent gets items they value highly, we create a fair allocation. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 4, 7]
}
```
