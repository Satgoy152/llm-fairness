Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  45  29  11  54  63  82  42  79
1  28  86  97  93  51  22   2  64  82
2  91  19  57  69   7  85  85  86  81
3  16  65  95  84  59  56   0  19  16
4   4  18  18   5  39  84  48  15   7
5  36  97  27  40  51  68  15  79  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets a reasonable share of items based on their valuations. One such method is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated. This is a simple approach that maximizes individual satisfaction for each item.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (91).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by agent 5 (97).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by agent 1 (97).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by agent 1 (93).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (54).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (63).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (82).
8. **Item 7**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (86).
9. **Item 8**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (79).

Now, let's allocate the items based on this criterion:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6, 8],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and a total of 9 items are allocated.
