Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60   2  73   8   9  83  26  61  59
1  81  28  55  82  90  76  45  54  58
2  70  96  20  46   7  95  14   5  86
3  68  18  27  52  52  38  76  50  70
4  20  99  53  14  62  29  19  39  84
5  56  54  23  98   6  23  26  42  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. We'll take into account the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute them accordingly. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation strategy:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it most with 81.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it most with 99.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it most with 73.
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it most with 98.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it most with 90.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it most with 95.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it most with 76.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it most with 61.
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it most with 86.

Now, let's put this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated once, all 9 items are distributed, and the allocation respects the highest valuations by each agent for those items.
