Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98   5   9  44  89  87  35  87   3
1  64  41  67  30   0   4  41  57  49
2  93  17  95  13   0  37   5  58   6
3  77   9  51  77  65  87  81  64  70
4  63  69  87  61  21  41  69  38  84
5  50  84  38  17  28  62  43  17  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [50 84 38 17 28 62 43 17 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total value while distributing items as evenly as possible among agents. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Analyze each agent's top choices based on their valuations.
2. Attempt to distribute items so that each agent gets approximately equal value, taking into account their preferences.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets: [0, 4]
- Agent 1 gets: [2, 7]
- Agent 2 gets: [5]
- Agent 3 gets: [3, 6]
- Agent 4 gets: [8]
- Agent 5 gets: [1]

This distribution gives each agent a share of items considering their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1]
}
```
