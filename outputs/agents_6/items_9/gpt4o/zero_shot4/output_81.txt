Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14   3  74  98  60  86  27  67  31
1  60  61  67  42  82  87  69  47  10
2   3   5  29  92  51  45  66  57  78
3  38   7  17  56  39  51  68  61  56
4  42  76  15  52  98  98   8  15  10
5  50  26  90  76   8  89  23  91  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations each agent has for them. A simple approach is to go through each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items to the extent possible.

Below is a fair allocation of items to agents based on their valuations:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (60), so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (76), so allocate item 1 to agent 4.
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (90), so allocate item 2 to agent 5.
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (98), so allocate item 3 to agent 0.
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (98), so allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (89), so allocate item 5 to agent 5.
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (68), so allocate item 6 to agent 3.
8. Item 7: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (91), so allocate item 7 to agent 5.
9. Item 8: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (78), so allocate item 8 to agent 2.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [2, 5, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item and all 9 items are allocated.
