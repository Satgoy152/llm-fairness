Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  83  85  27  42  37  92  15  10
1  49  55  60  25  75  18  94  67  14
2  85  36  57  61  53  44  55  61  12
3  23  50  52  69  51  82  25   7   7
4  73  27  49   7  94  59  20  35  22
5  37  39  29  17  58  79  91  64  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is somewhat balanced based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign the item with the highest preference value to each agent.
2. If there are remaining items, continue assigning based on the next highest preference value until all items are allocated.

Let's compute this step-by-step:

1. Agent 0: Highest valued item is 6 (value 92).
2. Agent 1: Highest valued item is 6 (value 94), already taken by Agent 0, so next highest is 4 (value 75).
3. Agent 2: Highest valued item is 0 (value 85).
4. Agent 3: Highest valued item is 5 (value 82).
5. Agent 4: Highest valued item is 4 (value 94), already taken by Agent 1, so next highest is 0 (value 73).
6. Agent 5: Highest valued item is 6 (value 91), already taken by Agent 0, so next highest is 8 (value 86).

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We still need to allocate 3 more items. Continuing based on the next highest value:

7. Agent 0: Next highest is item 2 (value 85).
8. Agent 2: Next highest is item 7 (value 61).
9. Agent 5: Next highest is item 5 (value 79), already taken by Agent 3, so next highest is 4 (value 58), already taken by Agent 1, so next highest is 1 (value 39).

Now we have allocated all 9 items. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [8, 1]
}
```
