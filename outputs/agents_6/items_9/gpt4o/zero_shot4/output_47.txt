Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  45  44  76  57  39  19   8  77
1  46  19  21  89  54  96  79  70  52
2  48  16  10   8  47  23  48  50  89
3  91  76  92  45  94  94  39  96  14
4  71  50  28  84  12   3  85  22  11
5  98  21  73  72  72   3  30  53  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust the allocation to maintain fairness while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 3 is most valued by agent 1 with a value of 89.
2. Item 0 is most valued by agent 5 with a value of 98.
3. Item 8 is most valued by agent 0 with a value of 77.
4. Item 6 is most valued by agent 4 with a value of 85.
5. Item 7 is most valued by agent 3 with a value of 96.
6. Item 1 is most valued by agent 3 with a value of 76.
7. Item 2 is most valued by agent 3 with a value of 92.
8. Item 4 is most valued by agent 3 with a value of 94.
9. Item 5 is most valued by agent 1 with a value of 96.

After allocating the items based on maximum valuations, we need to ensure each agent gets a fair share. However, given the constraints, some agents may end up with no items, while others might have more. Let's adjust the allocation slightly to balance it better:

- Agent 0: Items [8]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 2: No items ([])
- Agent 3: Items [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 4: Item [6]
- Agent 5: Item [0, 7]

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 7]
}
```
