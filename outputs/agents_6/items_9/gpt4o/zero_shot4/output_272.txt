Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  63   1  52  58  51  57  52  52
1  99  28  18  93  18  94  40  30   9
2  62  10  68  99  97  12  88  59  47
3   2  83  23  47  21  84  35  90  15
4  20  70  89  23   8   4  37  73  47
5  91  13  42  66   8  64   8  49  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, I'll aim to distribute the items based on the valuations provided in the table. This involves making sure that each agent has a reasonable share of the total value of the items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has a high valuation for item 1, so they'll be allocated item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a very high valuation for item 0, so they'll be allocated item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high valuation for item 3, so they'll receive item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 7 highly, so they'll be allocated item 7.
5. **Agent 4**: Since agent 4 has a high valuation for item 2, they'll receive item 2.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent can have item 8, which they value highly.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 3** can also take item 5, as they have a high valuation for it.
- **Agent 5** can take item 4, which they have a reasonable valuation for.
- **Agent 2** can take item 6, which they value reasonably.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible, and that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [7, 5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8, 4]
}
```
