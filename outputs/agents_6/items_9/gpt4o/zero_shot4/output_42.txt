Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  15  56  88  35  28  18  18  25
1  50  73  49  33   2  34  20  56  42
2  77  29  47  33  34  99  46  49  89
3  10  58  63  37  39  97  47  43  79
4  21  34  60  20   8  98  53  68   0
5   1  69  43  80   6  85  59  35  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 3.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 5.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 5 but it can be assigned item 2 instead to keep the allocation fair.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 7.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 3 but can be assigned item 8 instead.

Now, allocate the rest of the items based on the next highest valuations, ensuring all items are assigned:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 0 (since they have significant value for item 3 and some value for item 0)
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 6 (since they value item 1 highly, and have a moderate value for item 6)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (since they highly value it)
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 4 (as they have a reasonable value for item 4, and item 2 is high-valued)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (since they highly value it)
- Agent 5: Item 8 (since they have a moderate valuation for it)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent has some level of value in what they receive.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8]
}
```
