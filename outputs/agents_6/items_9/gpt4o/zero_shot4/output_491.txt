Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  46  23   7   0  17  92  31  64
1  57  73  90  84  23  51  49  18  91
2  99   0  80  23  78  66  42  84  35
3  11  77  92  28  42  22  57  44  34
4  51  27  17  48  61  69  91  61  25
5  88  55  27  71  62  95  58  46  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will attempt to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair number of items, as close to balanced as possible. Given there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 can be assigned item 6 because it has the highest value for it.
2. Agent 1 can be assigned item 2 because it has the highest value for it.
3. Agent 2 can be assigned item 0 because it has the highest value for it.
4. Agent 3 can be assigned item 1 because it has the highest value for it.
5. Agent 4 can be assigned item 7 because it has the highest value for it.
6. Agent 5 can be assigned item 5 because it has the highest value for it.

Now, for the remaining items (3, 4, 8):
- Item 3 can be given to Agent 1, who values it highly (84).
- Item 4 can be given to Agent 5, who values it (62).
- Item 8 can be given to Agent 1, who values it (91).

This ensures all items are allocated and tries to balance the allocations fairly among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3, 8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5, 4]
}
```
