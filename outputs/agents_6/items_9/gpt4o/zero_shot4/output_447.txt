Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  35  58  35  82  91  76   9  83
1  97  33  88  41  50  95  27  82  58
2  50  50  46  95  45  79  76   5  88
3  78   1  55  65  59  17  45  67  49
4   1  54   0  80   2  76  61  26  48
5  75  41  34  50  75  19  23  10  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item. Given there are 9 items and 6 agents, one or more agents may receive more than one item, but we should aim to distribute them as fairly as possible.

Here's a possible fair allocation approach:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent one by one until each agent has at least one item.
2. Distribute any remaining items to maximize the total valuation.

Based on the table provided, let's assign items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is 91 for item 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is 97 for item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is 95 for item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is 78 for item 0, but since item 0 is taken, next highest is 67 for item 7.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is 80 for item 3, but since item 3 is taken, next highest is 76 for item 5, but since item 5 is taken, next highest is 61 for item 6.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is 75 for item 0, but since item 0 is taken, next highest is 75 for item 4.

Now, we have utilized 6 items and need to allocate the remaining 3 items.

Continuing the allocation based on remaining highest valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest available is item 8 with a value of 83.
- **Agent 1**: Next highest available is item 2 with a value of 88.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest available is item 1 with a value of 50.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
