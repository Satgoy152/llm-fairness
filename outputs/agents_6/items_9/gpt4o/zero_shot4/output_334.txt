Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  56  53  24  80  37  51  15  96
1   5  20  72  65  40  34  81  20  65
2  23  11  71  61  37  51  61  67  60
3  62   5  83  62   5   9  43  62  85
4  99  96  35  61  51  33  24  88  69
5   1  13  13  78  93  13  76  88  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach considering each agent's valuation for the items. One way to approach this is to sequentially give each agent their highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet, and then move to the next agent and repeat until all items are allocated. This way, each agent gets a chance to receive an item they value highly. Let's implement this approach:

1. Create a list of items for each agent, initialized as empty.
2. Track which items have been allocated.
3. Iterate over agents, assigning the highest-valued non-allocated item to each agent in turn.

Let's do this:

1. Initialize an empty allocation list for each agent.
2. Use a loop to allocate items based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 gets item 8 because it has their highest value (96).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 because it has their highest value (72).
- Agent 2 gets item 7 because it has their highest value (67).
- Agent 3 gets item 3 because it has their highest value (62).
- Agent 4 gets items 0 and 1 because they have high values for them (99 and 96).
- Agent 5 gets items 4, 5, and 6 because they have relatively high values for them (93, 13, 76). 

This way, all items are allocated, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
