Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  58  41  46  84  94  34  42   0
1  56  22  63  55   4  12  82  76  73
2  12  90  30  61  82  71  37  46  47
3  69  33  47   2  68  84  62  81  12
4  63  30  24  93  53  72  89  29  61
5  11  64   9  34  51  75  89  70  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to assign items to the agent that values them the most. Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 at 69.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 at 90.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 at 63.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 at 93.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 at 84.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 at 94.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 at 89.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 at 81.
9. **Item 8**: The highest valuation is by agent 5 at 90.

After assigning based on the highest value for each item, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and only 9 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 0, 7
- Agent 4: Items 3, 6
- Agent 5: Item 8

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [8]
}
```
