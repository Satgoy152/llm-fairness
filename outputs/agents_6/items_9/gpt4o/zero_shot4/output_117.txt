Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  30  28  46  87   0  56  15  77
1  73  25  95  56  72  16  21  29  18
2  46  82  24  50  59  94  23  33  89
3  45  45  63   7  57  24  65  98  65
4  40  64   8  22  84  37  52  52  71
5  73  18   3  85  25  16  22   0  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items in decreasing order of value until all items are assigned.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Sort all the values in descending order with their respective agent and item indices.**

   Sorted values with agent and item indices:
   - (98, 3, 7)
   - (97, 5, 8)
   - (95, 1, 2)
   - (94, 2, 5)
   - (91, 0, 0)
   - (89, 2, 8)
   - (87, 0, 4)
   - (85, 5, 3)
   - (84, 4, 4)
   - (82, 2, 1)
   - (77, 0, 8)
   - (73, 0, 0)
   - (73, 1, 0)
   - (72, 1, 4)
   - (71, 4, 8)
   - (65, 3, 6)
   - (65, 3, 8)
   - (64, 4, 1)
   - (63, 3, 2)
   - (59, 2, 4)
   - (57, 3, 4)
   - (56, 0, 3)
   - (56, 1, 3)
   - (52, 4, 6)
   - (52, 4, 7)
   - (50, 2, 3)
   - (46, 0, 3)
   - (46, 2, 0)
   - (45, 3, 0)
   - (45, 3, 1)
   - (40, 4, 0)
   - (37, 4, 5)
   - (33, 2, 7)
   - (30, 0, 1)
   - (29, 1, 7)
   - (28, 0, 2)
   - (25, 1, 1)
   - (25, 5, 4)
   - (24, 2, 2)
   - (24, 3, 5)
   - (23, 2, 6)
   - (22, 4, 3)
   - (22, 5, 6)
   - (21, 1, 6)
   - (18, 1, 8)
   - (18, 5, 1)
   - (16, 1, 5)
   - (16, 5, 5)
   - (15, 0, 7)
   - (8, 4, 2)
   - (7, 3, 3)
   - (3, 5, 2)
   - (0, 0, 5)

2. **Allocate items to agents following the sorted order without repeating items and ensuring each item is given to one agent only.**

   The allocation could be as follows:

   - Agent 3 gets item 7 (value 98)
   - Agent 5 gets item 8 (value 97)
   - Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 95)
   - Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 94)
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 91)
   - Agent 2 gets item 8 (value 89)
   - Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 87)
   - Agent 5 gets item 3 (value 85)
   - Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 64)

3. **Prepare the final JSON allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and all 9 items are distributed.
