Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  49  78  94  87  85  30  55  69
1  35  38  88  66  79  83  23  11   0
2  50  36   9  43  77  78  41  33  49
3  84  63  87  65   4  29  41  96  41
4  77  25  55  46   0  71  25  36  22
5  67  71  12  22  60  32  76  35  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

To achieve this, we'll follow a greedy approach, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most and ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 84).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by agent 5 (value 71).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 78).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 94).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by agent 1 (value 79).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 85).
7. Item 6 is valued highest by agent 5 (value 76).
8. Item 7 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 96).
9. Item 8 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 69).

With this allocation, we ensure each item goes to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
