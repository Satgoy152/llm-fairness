Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  87   5  19  61  55  84  55  54
1  78  34  15  84  72  51  34  14  90
2  36  72   7  49   2  40  57  11  30
3  41  62  69  56  23  64  83  61  25
4  32  89  34  71  39  27  66  88  40
5  67  73  98  43  97  37  55  25  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent. Below is one possible fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's total value:

- Agent 0: Given the highest value for item 1.
- Agent 1: Given the highest value for item 8.
- Agent 2: Given the highest value for item 1.
- Agent 3: Given the highest value for item 6.
- Agent 4: Given the highest value for item 7.
- Agent 5: Given the highest value for item 2, 4, and 5. 

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items that they value highly.
