Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  51  85  58   2  43  99  37  69
1  60  97  66  88  75  53  67  82  84
2  36  13  26  18  81  14  45  96  36
3  11  47  86  37  46  74  12  21  36
4  19  57  20  88  74  63  77  61  35
5  18  16  96  76  71  84  75  80  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we aim to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 99, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 97, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 7 the most at 96, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 86, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 3 the most at 88, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 2 the most at 96, but it is already allocated. Next highest is item 5 at 84, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

At this stage, we have allocated 6 items, and we need to fairly distribute the remaining 3 items among the agents while considering their valuations. The remaining items are 0, 4, and 8.

7. **Unallocated Items**:
   - **Item 0**: Highest valuation is from Agent 1 at 60, but next best unallocated is Agent 0 with 26. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 4**: Highest valuation is from Agent 2 at 81. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 8**: Highest valuation is from Agent 1 at 84. Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

Thus, each agent gets a fair share, and all items are allocated. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```
