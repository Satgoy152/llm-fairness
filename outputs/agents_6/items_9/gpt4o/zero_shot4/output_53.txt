Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  44  34  92  33  25  78  10  75
1  49  45   7  35  34  95  10  83   1
2  44  51  25  88  47   9  37  20  12
3  57   1  51  52  44  48  64  42  27
4  61   2  83  70  77  13   8  34  54
5  17  42  51  94   1  64  31  45   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives items that have relatively high values for them compared to others.
2. Agent 1 receives items that have relatively high values for them and are not strongly preferred by others.
3. Continue this process for all agents to ensure fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 6 (values: 92 and 78)
- Agent 1: Items 5 (value: 95)
- Agent 2: Items 1 (value: 51)
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 8 (values: 51 and 27)
- Agent 4: Items 4 and 7 (values: 77 and 34)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (value: 17)

Now, let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [0]
}
```
