Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  92  11  57  82  80  21   3  45
1  68  84   9  12  29  87  99  15  93
2  25  80   6  50  59  36  41  19  26
3  20  64  85  15  18  51   3  87  18
4  76  20  13  37  73  79  23  89  52
5  22  14  84  98  77  85   6  42  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 80  6 50 59 36 41 19 26]

 [22 14 84 98 77 85  6 42 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, not every agent will receive an item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation while distributing the items as evenly as possible among the agents.

Here's a suggested allocation based on maximizing the value for each agent while ensuring fairness:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 92).
2. Assign item 6 to agent 1 (value 99).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 59).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value 85).
5. Assign item 7 to agent 4 (value 89).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 5 (value 98).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 80).
8. Assign item 8 to agent 1 (value 93).
9. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (value 76).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7, 0],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items fairly while also considering the value each agent places on the items they receive.
