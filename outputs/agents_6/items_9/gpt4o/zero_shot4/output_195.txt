Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35   1  11  70  94  99  40  39  88
1  82  57  60  51  40  79  38  94  74
2  28  49  60  75  53  45  67  67  38
3   1  11  26  65  29  44  66  74  53
4  54  13  15  21  54  78  83  81  17
5  24  62  95  78  28  18  45  58  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider a strategy where each agent receives a different number of items, aiming to maximize individual valuations while ensuring fairness. A straightforward approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that no item is assigned more than once, and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 5, 4, and 3. Assign items 5 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 0, 7, and 8. Assign items 0 and 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 3, 2, and 6. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 7, 6, and 3. Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 6, 7, and 5. Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest values are for items 2, 3, and 8. Assign items 8 and 2 to Agent 5.

Let's check the allocations to ensure that all items are uniquely assigned and that exactly 9 items are allocated. 

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [5, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 7]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [8, 2]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8, 2]
}
```
