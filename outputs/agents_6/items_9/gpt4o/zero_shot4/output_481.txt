Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  55  46  30  37  67  32  32  53
1  57  13  24  66  98  38  25  67  89
2  99  90  19  50  46  40  20  91  84
3  33  12  88  65  24  74  99  20  13
4  83  22  30  96  73  81  85  12  49
5  46  61  62  30  20  86  42  46  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation across all agents. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items to identify which items are most valuable to each agent.
2. Assign items to agents, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Valuations are relatively low compared to others, but has a high valuation for item 5.
- **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 4, 8, and 3.
- **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 7.
- **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
- **Agent 4**: Has high valuations for items 3, 5, 6.
- **Agent 5**: Has a moderate distribution across items but not significantly high in any particular category.

Based on these observations, a possible allocation might be:

- **Agent 0**: [5]
- **Agent 1**: [4, 8]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 1]
- **Agent 3**: [2, 6]
- **Agent 4**: [3]
- **Agent 5**: [7]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed. Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7]
}
```
