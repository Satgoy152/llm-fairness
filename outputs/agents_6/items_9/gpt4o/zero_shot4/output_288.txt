Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  31  81  78  98  12   6   7  63
1  37   8  43  30  41  25  52  30  48
2   5  89  79  18  58  58  33  74  72
3  48  50  71  92  89  38  63  39  15
4  34  27  42  49  68  49   3  63  20
5  64  84  22  42  29  51  24  87  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations such that each agent receives a fair share of the total value. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 1.5 items on average. However, since each agent must receive an integer number of items, some agents will receive 1 item and others will receive 2 items.

Let's try to allocate based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Based on the table given:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 4 and 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 6 and 8.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 3 and 0.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 4 and 7.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 7 and 8.

We'll try to allocate the highest valued items first while ensuring each agent gets an item:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 7.
- Agent 5 gets item 8.

Next, we need to allocate the remaining 3 items:

- Agent 0 can get item 2, as it has a high value for it.
- Agent 2 can get item 5, as it is next highest for them.
- Agent 5 can get item 0, as it is their next highest item after the ones already allocated.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8, 0]
}
```
