Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  55  93  80  44  27  86  55  29
1  68  51  44  30  19  21  48  35   8
2   1  26   8  43  40  96  30  40  61
3  17  45  29  34   5   6  27   1  91
4  77   9  61  59  25   8  35  34  62
5  67  94  81  52  51  61  27  23   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to give each agent a share of the items that maximizes their individual satisfaction. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but overall, the distribution should account for the valuations provided.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 0.
2. Agent 1 has a moderate preference for item 0.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5.
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 8.
5. Agent 4 has a preference for item 0.
6. Agent 5 has a high value for item 1.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Items [8, 3]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 5: Item [1]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated equals 9.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [8, 3],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [1]
}
```
