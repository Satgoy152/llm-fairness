Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  42  35  76   1  88  42  51  32
1  53  67  82  32   0  90   4   5  49
2  92   7  52  83  94  67  18  89  28
3  48  38  47  31  75   6  13   9  49
4  95  82  26   2  15  83  47  11   9
5  30  29   0  64  83  45  43  24  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
3. If some agents have no items, adjust allocations by swapping to ensure fairness while maintaining high overall valuations.

Following this approach:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (95)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (82)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (82)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (83)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (94)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (90)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (42)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (89)
- Item 8: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (68)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 7
- Agent 3: No items, swap item 6 from Agent 0
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1
- Agent 5: Item 8

After adjustment:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 4, 7]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [0, 1]
- Agent 5: [8]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 4, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": [8]
}
```
