Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  50  18  90  92  79  28  37  23
1  35  24  17  80  79  32  83  22  72
2  87  13  15  95   6  81  93  70  72
3  71  86  62  13  47  88  39   6  85
4  40  94  74   4   9  48  81   0  95
5  81  56   8  12  65  27  93  83   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. An equitable approach would be to allocate items such that each agent gets a similar level of satisfaction based on their valuations. 

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (90), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly (83), so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the least, but itâ€™s among the highest remaining, so we allocate item 8 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly (86), so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 8 highly (95), so we allocate item 4 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 7 highly (83), so we allocate item 7 to agent 5.

Now, we will allocate the remaining items based on relative valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (87), so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Item 5: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (88), so we allocate item 5 to agent 3.
- Item 2: Agent 4 has a higher valuation (74) than other unallocated agents, so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.

With this allocation strategy, each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [4, 2],
    "5": [7]
}
```
