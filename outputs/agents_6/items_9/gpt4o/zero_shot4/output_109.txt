Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  62  65  52  60  58  54  80  49
1  15  44  46  25   4  37   4  88  58
2  22  52  32  42  24   1  53  38  32
3  50  18  16  26  19  80  54  82  39
4  82  44  35  40  82  82  91   3  92
5  76  83  58  79   6  34  15  72  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is balanced. We also need to ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent can receive at least one item if possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Best items based on valuation: [7, 2, 1]
   - Allocation: [7]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Best items based on valuation: [7, 8, 2]
   - Allocation: [8]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Best items based on valuation: [1, 6, 3]
   - Allocation: [1]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Best items based on valuation: [5, 7, 6]
   - Allocation: [5]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Best items based on valuation: [8, 6, 0]
   - Allocation: [0, 6]

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Best items based on valuation: [8, 1, 3]
   - Allocation: [3, 2, 4]

Allocating in this manner ensures that each item is allocated, and agents receive items based on their highest valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [3, 2, 4]
}
```
