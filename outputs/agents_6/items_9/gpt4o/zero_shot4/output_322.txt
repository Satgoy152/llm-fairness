Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  26  12  85   0  38  39  39  93
1  44  56  84  40  58  68  76  91  54
2  51  97  24  24   8  73  68  29  29
3  35  41  91   7  97  55  23  81  23
4  75  93  89  83   1  92  58  67  57
5  81  42  53  49  62  58  94  91  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets a balanced allocation based on their preferences. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, we can give some agents more items than others due to the odd total number of items. Here’s a proposed allocation:

1. Start by finding the highest valued items for each agent to ensure they get something they value highly.
2. Try to distribute items evenly, considering both the number of items and the total value each agent receives.

After reviewing the table, here’s a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the highest, so we allocate item 8 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, so we allocate item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest, so we allocate item 5 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 6 the highest, so we allocate item 6 to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 out of 9 items. The remaining items are 0, 3, and 7. We will allocate these to balance the number of items each agent receives.

- Allocate item 0 to agent 5, as agent 5 values item 0 relatively high.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 values item 3 highly.
- Allocate item 7 to agent 4, to balance item distribution.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [6, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and that all 9 items are allocated.
