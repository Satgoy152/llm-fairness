Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  49  73  76  55  51   4  53  58
1  14  59  40  71  40  33  84  60  74
2  32  88  38   8  58  46   5  80  12
3  98  26  48  60  11  49   4  67  56
4  95  51  71  95  93  37  59  82  21
5  35  50   1  15  67  83  81  53  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed. Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation based on the valuations given:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3] - Total value = 75 + 76 = 151
2. **Agent 1**: Items [6, 8] - Total value = 84 + 74 = 158
3. **Agent 2**: Items [1] - Total value = 88
4. **Agent 3**: Items [2, 5] - Total value = 48 + 49 = 97
5. **Agent 4**: Items [4] - Total value = 93
6. **Agent 5**: Items [7] - Total value = 53

This allocation aims to distribute the items such that agents receive items that they value highly, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7]
}
```
