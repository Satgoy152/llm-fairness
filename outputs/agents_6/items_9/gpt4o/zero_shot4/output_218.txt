Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  81  14  94  88  54  33   5  78
1  88  28  64  91  85  43  51  67  36
2  54  64  59  42  46  44  59  53  17
3  35  52  73  65  77  23  83  29  57
4   5  97  42  49  22  85  94  59  20
5  72   7  44  13  26  62  75  38  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88 28 64 91 85 43 51 67 36]
 [54 64 59 42 46 44 59 53 17]

 [ 5 97 42 49 22 85 94 59 20]
 [72  7 44 13 26 62 75 38 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. Since there are more agents than items, some agents may not receive any items. We'll aim to maximize the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation that achieves this:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 94).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 88).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 97).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value 73).
5. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 94).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5 (value 62).
7. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 88).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value 67).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 3 (value 57).

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent who values it highly, maximizing total value.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [5]
}
```
