Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  92  54  65  19  88  22  80  39
1  28  44  86  79  76  85  86  80  26
2  57  56  89  31  70  55  22  62  24
3  97  13  61  59  73  84  92  22  74
4  89  39  23  77  45  49  53  54  88
5  92  92  77  59  21  84  45  92  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the total value of the items as evenly as possible among the agents. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

Let's compute the total values for each agent:

- Agent 0: 65 + 92 + 54 + 65 + 19 + 88 + 22 + 80 + 39 = 524
- Agent 1: 28 + 44 + 86 + 79 + 76 + 85 + 86 + 80 + 26 = 590
- Agent 2: 57 + 56 + 89 + 31 + 70 + 55 + 22 + 62 + 24 = 466
- Agent 3: 97 + 13 + 61 + 59 + 73 + 84 + 92 + 22 + 74 = 575
- Agent 4: 89 + 39 + 23 + 77 + 45 + 49 + 53 + 54 + 88 = 517
- Agent 5: 92 + 92 + 77 + 59 + 21 + 84 + 45 + 92 + 48 = 610

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Assign items to the agents in a way that maximizes their value while balancing the total value received.

Here's one possible allocation that aims to balance the distribution of total values:

- Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [8]
- Agent 5: [4, 7]

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives as evenly as possible.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [4, 7]
}
```
