Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  51  27  25  58  88  68  59  44
1   5  97  66   4  56  29  88  14  77
2  16  38  12  87  14  64  91  37  40
3  33  43  70  73  36  68   4  38  39
4  72  13  91  91  10  61  44  86  28
5  82  81  62  37  49  70  58  42  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can follow a straightforward approach of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Assign item 5 with a value of 88.
   - Assign item 6 with a value of 68.

2. Agent 1:
   - Assign item 1 with a value of 97.
   - Assign item 2 with a value of 66.

3. Agent 2:
   - Assign item 3 with a value of 87.

4. Agent 3:
   - Assign item 0 with a value of 33.

5. Agent 4:
   - Assign item 4 with a value of 10.

6. Agent 5:
   - Assign item 7 with a value of 42.
   - Assign item 8 with a value of 24.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7, 8]
}
```
