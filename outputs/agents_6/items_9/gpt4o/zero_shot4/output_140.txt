Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  53  16  49   3  35  57  86  55
1  90  81  54  70   7  86  68  86  99
2  97  35  56  56  66  80  84  95  91
3  38  28  45  69  73  20  47  22   2
4  77  77  42  65  48  36  19  56  54
5  78  64   7  97  82   4  73  26  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's preferences are considered, and the total value across all agents is maximized. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, one possible strategy is to assign items based on each agent's highest valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where feasible.

Let's allocate the items in a way that tries to maximize the sum of values for each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (86).
2. Agent 1 values item 8 the highest (99).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (97).
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (73).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 and 1 equally (77), but item 0 is already taken by agent 2. Therefore, assign item 1.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest (97).

Now that each agent has one preferred item, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2: Most valued by Agent 2 (56), but Agent 2 already has an item. The second-highest valuation is by Agent 1 (54), but Agent 1 also has an item. We can assign it to Agent 4, who valued it at 42.
- Item 5: Most valued by Agent 2 (80), but already has an item. The next highest is Agent 1 (86), already assigned. Agent 0 values it at 35 and is available.
- Item 6: Most valued by Agent 2 (84), already taken. Agent 5 values it at 73 and is available.

Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations.
