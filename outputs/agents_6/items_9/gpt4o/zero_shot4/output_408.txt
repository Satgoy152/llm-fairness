Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  53  59  14  67   6  69  13  93
1  18   6  56  43  74  56  23  85  95
2  45  72  59   1  10  30  70  54  73
3  51  10  16  63  19  36  28  10  56
4  51  34  87  25  24  74  88  33  89
5  86  45  23  89  34  21  78   7  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest valuation each agent has for the items and allocate those items first.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
3. Distribute any remaining items by considering the next highest valuations while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the most (93), so assign item 8 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 8 the most (95), but since it's already taken, assign their next highest, item 7 (85), to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (72), so assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (63), so assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 8 the most (89), but since it's already taken, assign their next highest, item 2 (87), to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most (89), but since it's already taken, assign their next highest, item 8 (95), to agent 5.

Since some items have been allocated to more than one agent due to conflicts, let's adjust:

- Reassign item 8 to agent 5 as it is their highest, and it was not the highest for agent 0. Assign item 6 (69) to agent 0.
- Assign item 5 (74) to agent 4 since it is their next highest unallocated.
- Assign item 0 (25) to agent 3 as their next highest unallocated.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their preferences.
