Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72   6  74  97  61  71  10  68  74
1   6  41  71  22  17  30  63   0  19
2  77  76  84   6  96  30   8  38   7
3   0  46  15  59  13  47  39   3  90
4  47  97  43  34  75  41  24  41  66
5  39  28  70  24  79  66  49  12  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 28 70 24 79 66 49 12 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Given that we have 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive only one item, while others will receive two items. 

Let's aim to allocate the items such that the total value for each agent is approximately balanced. Here's how we can distribute the items:

1. Agent 0 is assigned items with high valuations for them: `[2, 3]`
2. Agent 1 is assigned items where they have relatively higher valuations compared to other agents: `[1, 6]`
3. Agent 2 is assigned items with relatively higher valuations for them: `[0, 4]`
4. Agent 3 is assigned one high-value item: `[8]`
5. Agent 4 is assigned one item where they have a good valuation: `[7]`
6. Agent 5 is assigned one item where they have a decent valuation: `[5]`

This allocation attempts to provide a balanced distribution of total values across agents, considering their individual valuation preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
