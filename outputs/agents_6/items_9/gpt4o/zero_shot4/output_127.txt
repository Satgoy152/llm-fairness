Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  91  84  76  96  41  88  72  11
1  41  45  17  16  16  95  87  96   5
2  98  14  23  31  22  43  76  10  90
3  60  39  72   6  45  21  69  85   8
4  17  15  69  90  35  23  17  60   3
5  21  40  25  52  82  46  37  75  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, and 4. Let's allocate items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 and 7. Let's allocate items 5 and 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 0, but since it's already taken, we'll look for the next best options. Items 8 and 6 have relatively high values for Agent 2. Let's allocate items 8 and 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 7, but it's already taken, so we can allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 3, but it's already taken, so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** can receive item 1, as it hasn't been allocated yet.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [8, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
``` 

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.
