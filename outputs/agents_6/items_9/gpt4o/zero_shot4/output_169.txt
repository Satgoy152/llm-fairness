Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  23  57  94   6  94  62  49  65
1  55  93  30  46  52  53   6  40  13
2  88  29  89  99  92  21  37  18  83
3   8  51  11  89  20  66   4  22  48
4  71  27  81  89  71  90  64  44   0
5  34   8  30  91  83  63  30   3  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, the goal is to balance the total value of items each agent receives as much as possible. Considering the valuation matrix provided, here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each unallocated item while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

2. Ensure all items are allocated.

Following these principles, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 (94), 5 (94)
- Agent 1: Items 0 (55), 4 (52)
- Agent 2: Items 2 (89)
- Agent 3: Items 7 (22), 8 (48)
- Agent 4: Items 6 (64)
- Agent 5: Item 1 (8)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```
