Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  88  86  24  75   8  90   5  48
1  17  31  81  83   5  20  19  77  62
2  65  68  95  56  16  49   3  84  83
3  70  28  85  74  19  91  40  70  66
4  35  97  14  19  23  90  14  86  70
5   7  88  94  87  39   1  87  21  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an allocation that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations, while also ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one way to do this:

1. Sort all the agent-item pairs by their valuation in descending order.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, provided the agent hasn't already received an item.

Following these steps, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (Value: 90)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (Value: 81)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (Value: 68)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (Value: 91)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (Value: 86)
- Agent 5: Item 8 (Value: 76)
- Agent 0: Item 0 (Value: 73)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (Value: 83)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (Value: 16)

Now, let's represent these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8]
}
```
