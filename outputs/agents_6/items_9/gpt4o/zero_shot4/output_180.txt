Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  85  83  26  97  63  22  71  70
1  43  96  31  74   6  34  47  10  68
2  13  77  62  79  86  81  43  99  77
3  89  33  47  13  81  53  90   0  18
4  34  69  67  78  49  99  95  35  87
5  31  36  20   7  20  23  96  73  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This method ensures that each item is assigned optimally to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 at 43, Agent 2 at 13, Agent 3 at 89, Agent 4 at 34, and Agent 5 at 31. The highest value is 89 by Agent 3. Therefore, assign Item 0 to Agent 3.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 96, Agent 2 at 77, Agent 3 at 33, Agent 4 at 69, and Agent 5 at 36. The highest value is 96 by Agent 1. Therefore, assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 at 31, Agent 2 at 62, Agent 3 at 47, Agent 4 at 67, and Agent 5 at 20. The highest value is 83 by Agent 0. Therefore, assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 at 74, Agent 2 at 79, Agent 3 at 13, Agent 4 at 78, and Agent 5 at 7. The highest value is 79 by Agent 2. Therefore, assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 at 6, Agent 2 at 86, Agent 3 at 81, Agent 4 at 49, and Agent 5 at 20. The highest value is 97 by Agent 0. Therefore, assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 at 34, Agent 2 at 81, Agent 3 at 53, Agent 4 at 99, and Agent 5 at 23. The highest value is 99 by Agent 4. Therefore, assign Item 5 to Agent 4.

7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 47, Agent 2 at 43, Agent 3 at 90, Agent 4 at 95, and Agent 5 at 96. The highest value is 96 by Agent 5. Therefore, assign Item 6 to Agent 5.

8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 at 10, Agent 2 at 99, Agent 3 at 0, Agent 4 at 35, and Agent 5 at 73. The highest value is 99 by Agent 2. Therefore, assign Item 7 to Agent 2.

9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 68, Agent 2 at 77, Agent 3 at 18, Agent 4 at 87, and Agent 5 at 89. The highest value is 89 by Agent 5. Therefore, assign Item 8 to Agent 5.

With this allocation strategy, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the total value distributed among all agents. Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6, 8]
}
```
