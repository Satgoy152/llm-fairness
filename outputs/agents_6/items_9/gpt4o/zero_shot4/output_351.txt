Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  89  89  59  83  55  45  85  84
1  21  12  66  43  61  46  17  38  78
2  29  14   8  73  76   5  17  39  99
3  28  29  44  31  85  47  36  71  92
4  32  59  31  82  14  83  98  91   7
5  31  85  63  61  14  19  51  33  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. A fair allocation can be achieved by considering the valuations provided by each agent for each item and attempting to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0 and 1. 
2. **Agent 1** has a high value for item 8. 
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly. 
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly. 
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 highly. 
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 highly. 

By assigning items based on these preferences, we can attempt a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 8
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Items 2, 5, and 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
