Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  51   4  94  26  16  20  76  66
1  72  43  71  85  45  36  64  14  69
2  34   0  36  49  21  73  31  83  80
3  66  50  36  27  82  29  13  61   5
4  24  79  93  46  87  68  51  77  87
5  95  34  22  14  57  44  89  50  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item to the extent possible, but since there are only 9 items, some agents may not receive any.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated:

1. Agent 0: Items 0, 3
2. Agent 1: Item 2
3. Agent 2: Item 7
4. Agent 3: Items 4, 6
5. Agent 4: Items 1, 8
6. Agent 5: Item 5

Now let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [1, 8],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, aiming for a fair distribution based on their valuations.
