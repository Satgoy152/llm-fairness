Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  91  81  85  56  28  88  40  31
1  79  34  25  99   5   8  40  56  33
2  56  80   1  60  22  72  84  42  94
3  68  71  52  16   4  28  83  80  66
4  99  91  65  16   8  16  15  74  20
5  66  93  17   3   1   2  97  64  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [66 93 17  3  1  2 97 64 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

One possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items and assign them:

1. For item 0, the highest valuation is by agent 4 (99).
2. For item 1, the highest valuation is by agent 5 (93).
3. For item 2, the highest valuation is by agent 0 (81).
4. For item 3, the highest valuation is by agent 1 (99).
5. For item 4, the highest valuation is by agent 0 (56).
6. For item 5, the highest valuation is by agent 2 (72).
7. For item 6, the highest valuation is by agent 5 (97).
8. For item 7, the highest valuation is by agent 0 (40).
9. For item 8, the highest valuation is by agent 2 (94).

Now, let's compile these allocations into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also distributing the items among the agents as fairly as possible.
