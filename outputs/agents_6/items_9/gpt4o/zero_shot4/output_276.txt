Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  86  23   1  73  47  57  81  51
1  28  61  54  93  63  54  74   0  77
2  64  38  45  56  42  70  78  47  19
3  34  21  69   9  81  54  67  95  98
4  42  31  63  55  37  32  14  34  10
5  79   3  55  30   8  12  49  29  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method where we attempt to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring every agent gets at least one item, where possible, and the total number of items allocated equals 9. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest value for each agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and no items are left unallocated.

Here's a fair allocation based on the table provided:

- Agent 0 gets the item with the highest value for them: item 1.
- Agent 1 gets the item with the highest value for them: item 3.
- Agent 2 gets the item with the highest value for them: item 6.
- Agent 3 gets the item with the highest value for them: item 8.
- Agent 4 gets the item with the highest value for them: item 2.
- Agent 5 gets the item with the highest value for them: item 0.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 can also get item 7 (second highest value for them).
- Agent 3 can also get item 4 (second highest value for them).
- Agent 1 can also get item 5 (second highest value for them).

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8, 4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
