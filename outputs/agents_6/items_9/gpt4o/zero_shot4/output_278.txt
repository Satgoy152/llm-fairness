Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  16  50  71  70  88  31  18  71
1  89  58  39  68  63  89  50  42  78
2   7   1  49   3  39   5   5  95  56
3  25  92  66  25  72  17  79  66  15
4  47  83  31  72  96  80  17  29  34
5  33   6  98  18  21  60  51  65  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that every item is assigned and no agent is left without consideration. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's go through the items and assign each to the agent with the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 1 (89)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 3 (92)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 5 (98)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 0 (71)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 4 (96)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 0 and agent 1 (89), assign to agent 0 to balance allocations
- Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 3 (79)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by agent 2 (95)
- Item 8: Highest valuation by agent 1 (78)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
