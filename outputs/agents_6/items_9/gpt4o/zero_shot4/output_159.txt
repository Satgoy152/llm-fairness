Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  45   7  18  68  53  15  36  13
1  27  14  27  83  14   5  58  61  63
2  14   7  30  85  94  88  74  97  34
3  18  62  47  61  46  14  56  45  43
4  84  93  82  37  24  66  40  58  87
5  47  46  61  67  67  98  90  49  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we strive to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every agent gets roughly the same number of items. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive 1 item while others will receive 2 items. We'll attempt to balance the total value across agents as much as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning one item to each agent based on the highest value they have for any item.
2. Then allocate the remaining items to the agents who will benefit the most from them, trying to maintain balance.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 90)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 83)
- **Agent 2**: Item 7 (value 97)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 62)
- **Agent 4**: Item 8 (value 87)
- **Agent 5**: Item 5 (value 98)

After each agent has one item, the remaining items are 2, 4, and 6. Let's allocate these to maximize the overall value and balance:

- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 5 (value 61, highest remaining preference)
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 94, highest remaining preference)
- **Item 6**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 58, highest remaining preference)

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives either one or two items, and the distribution aims to maximize the total value for each agent.
