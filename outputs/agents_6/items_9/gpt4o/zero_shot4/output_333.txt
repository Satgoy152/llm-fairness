Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  83  56  77  19  97  40  91  86
1  99  39  68  29  45  70  38  53  23
2  84  61  80  65  15  77   0  33  64
3  29  49  49   9  59  91  16  84  35
4  41  20  73  21  78  12  53  44  26
5   4  68  46  97  23  17  23  29  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for the items. A potential method to achieve this is by assigning items to agents such that the overall satisfaction of all agents is maximized. We will try to ensure that each agent gets approximately the same number of items.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value: 97).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value: 99).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value: 80).
4. Assign item 7 to agent 3 (value: 84).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value: 78).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 5 (value: 97).
7. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value: 83).
8. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value: 53).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 2 (value: 64).

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and it attempts to distribute items in a way that provides each agent with items they value highly.

The JSON output for this allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [3]
}
```
