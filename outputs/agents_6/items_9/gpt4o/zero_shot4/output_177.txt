Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  79  83  83  42  82  25  12  52
1  54  56  16  21  34  86  59  92   9
2  51  51  74  52  22  93  69  44  70
3   5  40  29  34  31  23  47  34   9
4  82  18  85  30  35  34  64  64  81
5  88  72  40  50  26  90  62  62  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach such as attempting to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (since there are 6 agents and 9 items). Here's how we can proceed:

1. Calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure that all 9 items are distributed.

Based on this approach, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Values item 1 the most (79), so assign item 1.
- Agent 1: Values item 7 the most (92), so assign item 7.
- Agent 2: Values item 5 the most (93), so assign item 5.
- Agent 3: Values item 3 the most (34), so assign item 3.
- Agent 4: Values item 2 the most (85), so assign item 2.
- Agent 5: Values item 0 the most (88), so assign item 0.

After the initial allocation, 3 items (4, 6, 8) remain unallocated. Distribute them to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Assign item 6 (valued at 25).
- Agent 4: Assign item 4 (valued at 35).
- Agent 5: Assign item 8 (valued at 59).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [0, 8]
}
```
