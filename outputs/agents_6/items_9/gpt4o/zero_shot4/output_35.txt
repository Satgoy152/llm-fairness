Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  29  58  37  66   4  46  56  87
1  99  48  25  15  67  63  22  85  83
2   0   2  49  13  68  17  67  99  34
3   6   3  62  47   9  39  14  55  47
4  59  68  95  18  86  37   2   3  17
5  53  23  52  84  58  36  11  74  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's one possible approach:

1. Calculate the value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with 99.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most with 68.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most with 95.
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it the most with 84.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with 66.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most with 63.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most with 67.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most with 99.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most with 87.

Now let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item by adjusting the allocations slightly if necessary:

- Agent 0: [4, 8] (total value: 66 + 87)
- Agent 1: [0, 5] (total value: 99 + 63)
- Agent 2: [6, 7] (total value: 67 + 99)
- Agent 3: [3]    (total value: 47)
- Agent 4: [1, 2] (total value: 68 + 95)
- Agent 5: []     (No initial allocation)

Since Agent 5 has no allocation, we need to adjust to ensure fairness. We can shift one item from an agent with multiple items:

- Agent 5 takes Item 3 from Agent 3, who will now need another item.
- Agent 3 takes Item 2 from Agent 4.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [4, 8]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [6, 7]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [3]

Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```
