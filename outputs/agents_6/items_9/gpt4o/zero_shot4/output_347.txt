Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  96  26  38  59  63  47  28   7
1  79  64  62  18   8  78  81  24  12
2  93  68  83  85  95  23  94  65  70
3  60  61  35  23  86  32  71  95  86
4  80  16   4  19  98  22   2  48   1
5  22  67  72  13  94  75  29  97  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated and every agent has an integer number of items. Let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has high valuations across several items. Allocate item 4 (value 95), item 6 (value 94), and item 2 (value 83) to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 7 (value 95) and item 8 (value 86) to Agent 3. Agent 3 values these items highly.

3. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 5 (value 75) and item 1 (value 67) to Agent 5. These are among the highest available values for remaining items.

4. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 0 (value 79) to Agent 1. This is a high-value item for Agent 1.

5. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 (value 38) to Agent 0. This is the highest-valued remaining item for Agent 0.

6. **Agent 4**: No items are allocated to Agent 4 because all items have already been allocated.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 6, 2],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, all 9 items have been distributed among the agents, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
