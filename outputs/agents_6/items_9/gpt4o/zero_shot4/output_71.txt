Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  52  81  78   8  36  17   6  57
1  88  54   3  22  49   5  80  32  80
2  72  82  41  80  25  72  56  51  68
3  65  52  10  67  81  95  99  33  83
4  93  76  85  66  53   6  16  27  86
5  75  13  53  10  56  26  37  81  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach that tries to maximize the value each agent gets while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, we can start by ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and then distribute the remaining items based on maximizing the total value for each agent.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. Assign an item to each agent based on their highest valuation for an unassigned item.
2. Repeat the process for the remaining items until all items have been allocated.

Here's the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (81).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (88).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (82).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6 (99).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 8 (86).
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 7 (81).

Now each agent has one item. We have allocated 6 items so far, and there are 3 items left to allocate (3, 4, 5).

Let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 3: Agent 2 has the second highest valuation (80), so it goes to Agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 3 has the next highest valuation (81), so it goes to Agent 3.
- Item 5: Agent 3 also has the highest valuation (95) for this item, so it goes to Agent 3.

After these allocations, the final distribution of items is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [6, 4, 5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.
