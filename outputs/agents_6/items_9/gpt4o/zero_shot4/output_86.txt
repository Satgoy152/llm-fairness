Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  40  65  83   7  23  96  88  79
1  70  89  70  73  17  21  32  93  66
2  51  80  31  14  75  71  48  55  61
3  78  66  29  83  68  89  14   6  48
4  39  35  21  76  75  88   5  79  48
5   1  80  48  61  71  76  92  87  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to balance the total value of items each agent receives. This can be achieved by examining the valuations and attempting to distribute items such that each agent receives a similar total value. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Begin by calculating the total valuation for each item across all agents to identify items with universally high values.
2. Assign items to agents aiming to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 6 and 7 (Values: 96, 88)
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 3 (Values: 89, 73)
- Agent 2: Items 4 and 5 (Values: 75, 71)
- Agent 3: Items 0 (Value: 78)
- Agent 4: Items 8 (Value: 48)
- Agent 5: Items 2 (Value: 48)

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent gets items of significant value according to their individual valuations.

Now, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [2]
}
```
