Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  80  46  36  26  95  10  69  73
1  22  58  71   0  16  73  79  44  81
2  52  61  48  15   6  37  92   2  89
3   4  19  38  44  91  88  77  51   0
4  84  83  82  74  55  96  33  51  35
5  50  31   3  21  31  81  14  96   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, each agent should ideally receive either 1 or 2 items (since there are 6 agents and 9 items). We aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Assign the items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item while also ensuring a fair distribution in terms of the number of items allocated to each agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
