Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  78  18  78   9  41  21   2  18
1   6  81  72  50  12  95  46  10  45
2  38   6  66   7  58  41  76  51  85
3  53  60   2  44  38  82  13   5  46
4  36  59  72  90  20  51  74  15  37
5  89  50  92  46   4  29  26  33  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we will consider each agent's valuation of the items. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 3 (both 78). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 5 (95). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 8 (85). Let's allocate item 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 5 (82), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 1 (60), but that's taken too. Let's allocate item 3 (44) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (90), but it's taken. The next highest is item 2 (72). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Has high valuations for items 2 (92) and 0 (89), but item 2 is taken. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated the following items:
- Item 0: Agent 5
- Item 1: Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 4
- Item 3: Agent 3
- Item 5: Agent 1
- Item 8: Agent 2

Remaining items to be allocated: 4, 6, and 7.

Let's allocate the remaining items based on the highest available valuations:

- **Item 4**: Agent 2 has the highest available valuation (58). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 has the highest available valuation (76). Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 has the highest available valuation (51). Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 6, 7, 8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 6 agents, respecting the individual valuations as closely as possible.
