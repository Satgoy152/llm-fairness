Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  91  85  31  72  62  10  19  94
1  84  49  18  64  50  94  13  91  84
2   1  14  66  93  71  44  40  24  98
3  71  28   1   1  56  85  94  92  64
4  90  66  51  66  15  13  38  64  54
5  56   0  39  82  49  65  78  85  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets at least one item, ensuring all 9 items are distributed. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning each agent at least one item based on their highest value.
2. Then, allocate the remaining items by considering agents' second-highest values for the remaining items.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the highest at 94.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 94.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the highest at 98.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest at 94.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest at 90.
- Agent 5 values item 8 the highest at 95.

Considering that item 8 is highly valued by multiple agents, we need to ensure fairness:

- Assign item 8 to Agent 2, as it is their highest value.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 5.

The remaining items (2, 3, 4) need to be allocated:

- Agent 0 can take item 2.
- Agent 1 can take item 3.
- Agent 5 can take item 4.

Now, the allocation is complete, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly among the agents, considering their valuations.
