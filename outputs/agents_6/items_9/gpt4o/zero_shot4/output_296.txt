Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  33  24  70  91  67  76  50  90
1  61   2  95  48  44   1  70   9  87
2   5  70  63  45  66  48  60  63  65
3  94  44  93  71  40  88  10  74  89
4  22  23  46  48  22  55  83  44  91
5  93  42  20  78  29  37  75   8  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives. We can approach this problem by selecting the highest value items for each agent and ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 6.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 3.

After assigning each agent their highest valued item, we can allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed:

7. Assign item 8 to Agent 3, as it has a high valuation and Agent 3 has room for another item.
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 4, considering a balanced allocation.
9. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, which balances out the allocations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [3]
}
```
