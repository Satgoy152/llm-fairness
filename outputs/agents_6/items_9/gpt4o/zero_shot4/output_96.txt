Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  99  88  48  89  29  24  92  77
1  49  83  56   6  87  35  57  58  54
2  32  58  96  75  51  35  62  71  87
3  19  50  80  37  66  61   0  22  30
4  90  94  77  54  20  29  90  39  29
5  44  52   6  64  52  37  20  66  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's how we can achieve that:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items** and then assign the items to agents in a way that maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Allocate items greedily**: Give each agent the item they value the most that hasn't been allocated yet.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

- **Initialization**: Each agent starts with no items.
- **Allocation**:
  - Agent 0: Assign item 1 (valuation: 99)
  - Agent 1: Assign item 4 (valuation: 87)
  - Agent 2: Assign item 2 (valuation: 96)
  - Agent 3: Assign item 5 (valuation: 61)
  - Agent 4: Assign item 0 (valuation: 90)
  - Agent 5: Assign item 3 (valuation: 64)
  
- **Distribute remaining items**: 
  - Remaining items: 6, 7, 8
  - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation: 92)
  - Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation: 87)
  - Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation: 90)

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [3]
}
```
