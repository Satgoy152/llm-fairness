Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  48  88  28  45  62  71  81   9
1  21  24  89  42  68  68  54  24   8
2  20  81  66  53  81  83  63  67  34
3  22  68  11  41  82  26  38  30  67
4  23  32  53  53  76  36   3  45  85
5  20   2  33  48  37  11  70  30  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 48 88 28 45 62 71 81  9]
 [21 24 89 42 68 68 54 24  8]
 [20 81 66 53 81 83 63 67 34]
 [22 68 11 41 82 26 38 30 67]
 [23 32 53 53 76 36  3 45 85]
 [20  2 33 48 37 11 70 30 63]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 6 agents, we can attempt to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible given the constraints). Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the highest valuation each agent has for any item and prioritize assigning those items.
2. Ensure all items are assigned.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, keeping the total number of items allocated to 9.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (88).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2, but it's taken, so we assign item 4 (68).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 1 and 4 (81), but item 4 is taken, so we assign item 1.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4, but it's taken, so we assign item 8 (67).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 8, but it's taken, so we assign item 3 (53).
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 6 (70).

Now, we have assigned 6 items. We still have items 0, 5, and 7 to be allocated. We can assign these to agents with fewer items based on their remaining highest valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (25).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (83).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (81).

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
