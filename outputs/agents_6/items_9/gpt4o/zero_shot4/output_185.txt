Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  95  46   3  57  61  32  88  22
1  57  81  41  68  97  82  23  42  26
2  68  41  86  12  81  77  77  17  59
3  84  66  87  87  21  90  15  77  22
4  74  64  55  24  73  12  53  88  50
5  29  63   0  26  89   7  43   2  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 9 items are allocated overall. We can use a simple greedy approach by selecting the highest value items for each agent in turn until all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.
3. Verify that exactly 9 items are allocated.

Following this method, we have:

- Item 0: Assigned to agent 3 (84)
- Item 1: Assigned to agent 0 (95)
- Item 2: Assigned to agent 3 (87)
- Item 3: Assigned to agent 3 (87)
- Item 4: Assigned to agent 1 (97)
- Item 5: Assigned to agent 3 (90)
- Item 6: Assigned to agent 2 (77)
- Item 7: Assigned to agent 0 (88)
- Item 8: Assigned to agent 2 (59)

Now, let's verify:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 7.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets items 6 and 8.
- Agent 3 gets items 0, 2, 3, and 5.
- Agent 4 gets no items.
- Agent 5 gets no items.

This distribution ensures that all 9 items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [0, 2, 3, 5],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
