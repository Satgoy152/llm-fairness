Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  34  28  13  29  74  76  81  32
1  67  81   1  67  85  19  77  34  21
2  48  85  12  50  67  61  51  82  98
3   4  96  38  44  37  33  39   1  90
4  33  54  69  68  14  75  40  21  49
5  57  46  40  64  50  66  93  59  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers the preferences each agent has for different items. One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation from agents until all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value is 74 by agent 0.
- Item 1: Highest value is 96 by agent 3.
- Item 2: Highest value is 69 by agent 4.
- Item 3: Highest value is 68 by agent 4.
- Item 4: Highest value is 85 by agent 1.
- Item 5: Highest value is 75 by agent 4.
- Item 6: Highest value is 93 by agent 5.
- Item 7: Highest value is 82 by agent 2.
- Item 8: Highest value is 98 by agent 2.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 7, 8
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Items 2, 3, 5
- Agent 5: Item 6

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 3, 5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
