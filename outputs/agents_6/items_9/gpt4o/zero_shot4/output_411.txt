Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  21  53  21  49  88  20  85  97
1  51   6  76  45  23  29  37  21  97
2  36  21  81  31  11   8  58  27  19
3  83  30  47  33  59  85  23  12  59
4  40  66   1  42  91  97  88  53  47
5  46   0  47  31  69  83  22  42  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach where each agent is assigned items that they value highly, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Select Initial High Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 8 the highest (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 8 the highest (97) but it's already taken, so next highest is item 2 (76).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (81) but it's already taken, so next highest is item 6 (58).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (83).
   - Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (97).
   - Agent 5 values item 5 (83) but it's already taken, so next highest is item 4 (69).

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate remaining items to agents who have lesser valued items or are missing items.
   - Ensure fairness by attempting to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: [8, 5] (Items 8 and 5 are highly valued by agent 0 and 4 but are allocated to maximize fairness)
- Agent 1: [2, 7] (Item 2 is highly valued by agent 1; item 7 is next available)
- Agent 2: [6] (Item 6 is highly valued by agent 2)
- Agent 3: [0] (Item 0 is highly valued by agent 3)
- Agent 4: [4] (Item 4 is allocated to agent 4)
- Agent 5: [1, 3] (Items 1 and 3 are allocated to agent 5 to balance out the distribution)

Here is the allocation in the requested json format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed.
