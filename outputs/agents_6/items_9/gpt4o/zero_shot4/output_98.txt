Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  63  53  57  95  60  20  59  69
1  61  49  61  56  10  56  11  47   2
2  19  77  93  74  34  97   7  33  51
3  54   0  15   7  69  66  49  12  64
4  54  69  34  24  32  10  18  45  79
5  94  49  27  45  96  43  40  45  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. We'll consider the values each agent places on the items and attempt to distribute them evenly based on their preferences.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocated items that maximize their total value.
2. Agent 1: Allocated items that maximize their total value.
3. Agent 2: Allocated items that maximize their total value.
4. Agent 3: Allocated items that maximize their total value.
5. Agent 4: Allocated items that maximize their total value.
6. Agent 5: Allocated items that maximize their total value.

Considering these points and the values in the table, hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [2, 6]
- Agent 3: [8]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [0, 7]

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 7]
}
```
