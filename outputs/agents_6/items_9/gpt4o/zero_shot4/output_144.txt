Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  95  59   7  11  47  83  31  23
1  11  72  69  65  31  29  69  54  80
2  53  23  78  54  75  19  98  89  60
3  56  65  14  10   3  57  89  23  22
4   3  63  15  90  90  31  25  94  39
5  63  73  24   5  36  50  51  64  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent's allocation maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's go through the process of allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (95), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 the most (80), so we allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the most (98), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 the most (89), but since it's already allocated to Agent 2, we look at the next highest value, which is item 5 (57), and allocate it to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values items 3 and 4 the most (90 each), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 the most (73), but since it's already allocated to Agent 0, we allocate their second highest value item, which is item 0 (63).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 2, 4, and 7. 

- Agent 2 has already received one item, but let's allocate item 7 to Agent 2 as they value it highly (89).
- Agent 4 will receive item 4 as it is one of their highest values (90).
- Lastly, Agent 3 can receive item 2 (14), which is better than their remaining unallocated options.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item based on their valuations, and all 9 items are distributed.
