Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  10  71  30  16  15  80  91  57
1  15  23  41  16  42  36  29   3  17
2  11  98  93  84  43  75   3  93   1
3  18  64  92  94  37  87  51  42  30
4  13  99  84  94  58  59  62  18  83
5  83  15  75  55  88  80  39  19  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valuation is for item 6 (value 80). Assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** The highest valuation is for item 2 (value 41). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** The highest valuation is for item 1 (value 98). Assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** The highest valuation is for item 3 (value 94). Assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** The highest valuation is for item 1 (value 99), but it is already taken. The next highest is item 3 (value 94), but it is also taken. The next highest is item 2 (value 84), but it is also taken. The next highest is item 8 (value 83). Assign item 8 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5:** The highest valuation is for item 0 (value 83). Assign item 0 to agent 5.

Now, 6 items have been allocated. We need to allocate 3 more items to ensure fairness and that all items are distributed.

- **Remaining items:** 4, 5, 7

Continue allocation based on remaining highest valuations:

7. **Agent 0:** The highest remaining valuation is for item 7 (value 91). Assign item 7 to agent 0.
8. **Agent 5:** The highest remaining valuation is for item 5 (value 80). Assign item 5 to agent 5.
9. **Agent 4:** The highest remaining valuation is for item 4 (value 58). Assign item 4 to agent 4.

Now every agent has at least one item and all items are allocated.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8, 4],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```
