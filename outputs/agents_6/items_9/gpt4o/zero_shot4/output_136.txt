Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  88   7   0  89  78  98   7  88
1  34  52  92  46  49  18  69  32  22
2   4  48   1  56  45  74  10   9  46
3  25  41  48  16   7  40  72  86  15
4  24   7  37  46  45  53  33  94  38
5  83  39  77  12   4   4  77  13  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute items such that each agent receives items with values that maximize their satisfaction, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has for a given item.
2. Ensure that each item is only allocated once and each agent receives a fair share.

Based on this approach, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the most, but since it's already taken, assign them item 8.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items while considering fairness:

- Agent 0 can also take item 1 (second highest valuation).
- Agent 1 can take item 4 (next highest available valuation).
- Agent 3 can take item 3 (next highest available valuation).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7, 3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving items based on their valuations as fairly as possible.
