Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5   1  26  45  22  33  36  56  88
1  94  88  42  51   2  88  33   9  56
2  78  82  36  76  39  96  25  60  21
3  88  15  20  43  76  68  32  89  79
4  33  13  75  46  36  90  73  64  16
5  41  66  48  91  20  22   5  81  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute them such that each agent receives a roughly equal total value from their allocated items. Given the valuations provided, an approximate approach is to assign items to agents based on their preferences, ensuring no agent is left with too little value compared to others.

One way to achieve this is through a greedy allocation strategy, where we assign items to agents who value them the most, while keeping track of the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 8.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the most.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the most.

Next, we distribute the remaining items by trying to balance the total valuation received by each agent:

- Agent 0 also receives item 6.
- Agent 1 also receives item 4.
- Agent 2 also receives item 1.
- Agent 3 also receives no additional items.
- Agent 4 also receives item 9.
- Agent 5 also receives no additional items.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, all 9 items have been distributed among the agents, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
