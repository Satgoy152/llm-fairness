Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  57  17  44  16  64  69  25  71
1  95  50  33  45  71  62  57  33  41
2  14   1  16  54  76  43  45   7  28
3  32  33  43  74  99  85  21  29  51
4  93  23  53  22  68  98  72  14  34
5  72  11  96  62  10  43  47  73  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and exactly 9 items are allocated in total. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each agent and assigning that item to them if it's not already taken.
2. Continue assigning the remaining items to the agents based on their next highest valuation until all items are allocated.

Upon reviewing the table and valuations, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 (96) the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 0 (95) the highest, but since item 0 is taken, we give them item 4 (71).
- Agent 2 values item 4 (76) the highest, but since item 4 is taken, we give them item 3 (54).
- Agent 3 values item 4 (99) the highest, but since item 4 is taken, we give them item 3 (74), but since that is also taken, they get item 5 (85).
- Agent 4 values item 5 (98) the highest, but since item 5 is taken, we give them item 6 (72).
- Agent 5 values item 2 (96) the highest.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3, which is their next highest valuation after their initial allocation.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 5, which is their next highest valuation after their initial allocation.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 0, which is their next highest valuation after their initial allocation.

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```
