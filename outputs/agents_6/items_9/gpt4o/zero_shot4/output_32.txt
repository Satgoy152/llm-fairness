Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  96  14  30  16  22  76  97  35
1  85  60  25  59  61  45  25  47  77
2  97  53  30  37  79  34   8  68  43
3  17  18  53  77  89  38  40  18   8
4  71  87   4  18  87  75  48  87  75
5  38   2  74  42  11  87  44  94  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach by analyzing the values each agent has for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction (valuation) of all agents. Since we have 9 items to allocate among 6 agents, some agents may receive more items than others, but we will aim for a distribution that maximizes fairness based on the given valuations.

Here's one way we can allocate the items:

1. Start by looking at the highest valuations for each item and assign the item to the respective agent.
2. Ensure that each agent ends up with at least one item, if possible, to maintain a fair distribution.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Item 0 has the highest value (97) for agent 2, so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.
2. Item 1 has the highest value (96) for agent 0, so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
3. Item 2 has the highest value (74) for agent 5, so we allocate item 2 to agent 5.
4. Item 3 has the highest value (77) for agent 3, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Item 4 has the highest value (89) for agent 3, but since agent 3 already has item 3, we look for the next highest value, which is 87 for agent 4. So, we allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. Item 5 has the highest value (87) for agent 5, but since agent 5 already has item 2, we look for the next highest value, which is 75 for agent 4. So, we allocate item 5 to agent 4.
7. Item 6 has the highest value (76) for agent 0, so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
8. Item 7 has the highest value (97) for agent 0, but since agent 0 already has items 1 and 6, we look for the next highest value, which is 94 for agent 5. So, we allocate item 7 to agent 5.
9. Item 8 has the highest value (77) for agent 1, so we allocate item 8 to agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, and each agent is considered in the distribution process.
