Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  19  12  80   9  38  14  35  73
1  93  77  55  70  48  37  65  90   9
2  94  18  60  59  76  54  39  69  43
3  99  85  61  57  69  55  67  47  39
4  52  80  13  31   0  57  25   1  28
5  20  92  51  75  59  73   6   7  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's look at a fair allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item.
2. Assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no item is left unallocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value = 94).
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most (value = 90).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (value = 76).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value = 85).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (value = 57).
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most (value = 75).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 8 (value = 73).
- Agent 1 can take item 6 (value = 65).
- Agent 5 can take item 2 (value = 51).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. 

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3, 2]
}
```
