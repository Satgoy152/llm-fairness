Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  69  70  27  78  80  32  82  44
1  11  12  60  14  20  95  31  71  25
2  54  44  13  72  71  82  85  91  67
3  94  28  12  47  95  90  87  16  86
4  55  87  43  42  46  97  13  30  11
5  29  60  93  37  84  90  68  30  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value, while also ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is a proposed allocation based on maximizing the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0 seems to have high valuations for items 0, 5, and 7.
- Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 7 and 6.
- Agent 3 values items 0 and 4 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 2 highly.

Taking these observations into account, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Gets items 0 and 7.
- Agent 1: Gets item 1.
- Agent 2: Gets item 6.
- Agent 3: Gets items 4 and 8.
- Agent 4: Gets item 5.
- Agent 5: Gets items 2 and 3.

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```
