Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  97   8  59   4  24  83  84  53
1  97  49  17  11  53  88  96   7  89
2  91  18  82  26  36  22   4  61  71
3  93  41  11  74   0  97  12  18  71
4  93  85  46   9  57  45  81  45  47
5  50  20   2  20  20  49  34  46   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives, while ensuring that all 9 items are distributed. Here's one way to achieve an allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. If some agents get no items, consider reallocating items from agents with multiple items to maintain fairness.
3. Check the total valuations to confirm a balanced distribution.

Following this approach, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1 (total valuation = 193)
- Agent 1 gets items 6, 8 (total valuation = 185)
- Agent 2 gets items 2, 7 (total valuation = 143)
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (total valuation = 97)
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (total valuation = 57)
- Agent 5 gets item 3 (total valuation = 20)

This distribution attempts to balance the allocations based on the highest valuations and ensures that all 9 items are assigned. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
