Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25   2  13  49  37  30  43  14  32
1  47  23  86  71  37  56  88  45  92
2  64  70  26  74  29  16  60  26  87
3  49  76  95  99  67  23  96  43  79
4  98  84  93  18  57  33  21  29  81
5   1  77  86  75  22  63  70  87  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider a simple strategy where we try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will inevitably receive more than one item, while others may receive only one or none, depending on the allocation strategy.

Let's aim to maximize the total value each agent receives:

1. Calculate the maximum value each agent can gain from the items.
2. Allocate the highest valued item to each agent, ensuring every item is allocated only once.
3. Adjust and ensure each agent has items proportional to their potential maximum value.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values: [25, 2, 13, 49, 37, 30, 43, 14, 32]
- Agent 1 values: [47, 23, 86, 71, 37, 56, 88, 45, 92]
- Agent 2 values: [64, 70, 26, 74, 29, 16, 60, 26, 87]
- Agent 3 values: [49, 76, 95, 99, 67, 23, 96, 43, 79]
- Agent 4 values: [98, 84, 93, 18, 57, 33, 21, 29, 81]
- Agent 5 values: [1, 77, 86, 75, 22, 63, 70, 87, 17]

To start, let's allocate items based on the maximum value each agent has:

1. Agent 4 gets item 0 (value 98).
2. Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 99).
3. Agent 1 gets item 8 (value 92).
4. Agent 5 gets item 7 (value 87).
5. Agent 2 gets item 1 (value 70).
6. Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 43).

The remaining items 2, 4, and 5 can be allocated based on the remaining highest values:

7. Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 86).
8. Agent 3 gets item 4 (value 67).
9. Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 63).

This allocation ensures each item is assigned only once and maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```
