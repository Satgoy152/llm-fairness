Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  33  16  67  87  19  60  77  38
1   7  68  77  47   4  16  83  67  86
2  13  61  38  19   0  29  55  91  58
3  61  26  67   9  11  60  57  20  43
4  58  76  33  88  94  13  58  73  51
5  12  49  26  54   0   9  96  52  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be done by iteratively assigning items to agents who value them the most until all items are allocated. Here's how we can achieve this:

1. For each item, identify the agent who values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
4. Continue until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 0 (value 57).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 4 (value 76).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (value 77).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 4 (value 88).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 4 (value 94).
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 3 (value 60).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 5 (value 96).
- Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 2 (value 91).
- Item 8 is valued highest by Agent 1 (value 86).

Now we ensure each agent receives at least one item. Adjustments may be needed to create a fairer distribution:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 8.
- Agent 2 receives item 7.
- Agent 3 receives item 5.
- Agent 4 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 5 receives item 6.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 3, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 9 items are distributed fairly based on the value each agent places on them.
