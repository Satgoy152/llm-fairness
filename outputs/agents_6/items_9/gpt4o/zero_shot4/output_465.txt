Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  69  90  47  92  89  75  36  25
1  55  14  62  52  42  73  69  73  61
2  54  66  20  90  59  64  54  40  90
3  47  17  46  73  11  60  26  70  82
4  10  95  56   6  74  48  54  45  25
5  40  41  31   6  25  86  79  73  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed.

First, let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure all items are allocated.

Looking at the table:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 55 (highest)
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it at 95 (highest)
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 90 (highest)
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 90 (highest)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 92 (highest)
- Item 5: Agent 5 values it at 86 (highest)
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it at 79 (highest)
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 73 (highest, tied with Agent 5)
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it at 90 (highest, tied with Agent 0)

Now, let's distribute the items while ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 7
- Agent 2: Items 3, 8
- Agent 3: No items (since no highest valuations)
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Items 5, 6

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
