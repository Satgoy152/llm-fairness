Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78   7  25  28  19  50  17  60   8
1   0  70  83  55  86  55   7  38  85
2  83  48   7  59  41  46  71  21   0
3  70  77  13  59  66  45  81  65  58
4  78  97  27  13  16  81  80  54  52
5  11  29  86  51  51  25  39  99  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on the given valuations. Here's a possible allocation that considers the agents' preferences:

1. First, we need to analyze the valuations and find a fair way to allocate the items. We can start by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. This helps ensure each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

2. Next, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none.

3. Make sure that the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.

Here's a possible allocation based on these considerations:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 4, 8]
- Agent 2 gets items [2]
- Agent 3 gets items [6]
- Agent 4 gets items [3]
- Agent 5 gets items [7]

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item (except agent 4), and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9, fulfilling the requirements.
