Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  89  83  95  80  95  24  93  40
1  10  95  25  61  66  28   0  88  96
2   5  37  80  35   1  63  50  46  74
3  15  51  19  75  36  13  57  86  14
4  76  61  46  69  10  18  78  70  37
5  83  47   5  54  16   8  26  54  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for each agent to receive an allocation that reflects a balance between their preferences and the overall distribution of items. Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's the allocation based on the table data:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 85.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 95.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 80.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 95.
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most with a value of 36.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 95.
7. Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 78.
8. Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most with a value of 86.
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 96.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible and adjust accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [2]
- Agent 3: Items [7]
- Agent 4: Items [6]
- Agent 5: Items [4]

This allocation ensures each agent gets items based on their highest valuations while distributing all 9 items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
