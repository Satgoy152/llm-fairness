Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  84  92  17  58  58   4  18  10
1  50  62   2   5  43  66   9  43  44
2  75  58  22  87  87  51  22  28  72
3   5  52  90  34  81   1  40  62  87
4  75  42  52   6  93  18  55  26  63
5  56  31  21  65  57   2  57  99  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring that exactly 9 items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a suggested allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a moderately high valuation for item 5. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 2, 4, and 8. Let's allocate item 8 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 4 and 0. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has a very high valuation for item 7. Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and we need to allocate 3 more. We'll allocate these remaining items while trying to balance the total value received by each agent:

7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it.
8. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as they have a moderate valuation for it.
9. Finally, allocate item 6 to Agent 1, as they have a moderate valuation for it.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
