Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  89  22  55  62  62  70  60  98
1  98  71  85  84  11  95  71  68  68
2  59  73  12  29  47  87  82  29  55
3  71  47  90  23  34  92  19  29  88
4  24  94  49  86  16  49  49  66  24
5  96  97  89  11  14  61  43  30  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. For each item, identify the agent who has the highest valuation for that item.
2. Assign that item to the identified agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.
4. If there are any conflicts (i.e., an agent is assigned more than one item when others have none), redistribute to ensure fairness.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (value = 98)
- Item 1: Agent 5 (value = 97)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (value = 90)
- Item 3: Agent 4 (value = 86)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value = 62)
- Item 5: Agent 3 (value = 92)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (value = 82)
- Item 7: Agent 4 (value = 66)
- Item 8: Agent 0 (value = 98)

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 8]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [6]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 7]
- Agent 5: Item [1]

Now, let's format the allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [3, 7],
    "5": [1]
}
```
