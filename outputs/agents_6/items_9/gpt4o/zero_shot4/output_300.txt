Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  86  97  80   5  66  98  90  56
1  59   2  93  26  91  83  19  28  53
2  44  71  31  32  98   2   0  87  78
3   9  78   0  83  72  15  40  11  25
4  44  94  25   4  64  44  53   8   6
5   8   9  78  44  22  34   5  69  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 86 97 80  5 66 98 90 56]
 [59  2 93 26 91 83 19 28 53]
 [44 71 31 32 98  2  0 87 78]
 [ 9 78  0 83 72 15 40 11 25]
 [44 94 25  4 64 44 53  8  6]
 [ 8  9 78 44 22 34  5 69 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each individual item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 98) and item 2 (value 97).
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 91).
- Agent 2 gets item 7 (value 87).
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 83).
- Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 94).
- Agent 5 gets items 0 (value 8), 5 (value 34), and 8 (value 27).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 5, 8]
}
```
