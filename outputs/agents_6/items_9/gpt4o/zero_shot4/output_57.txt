Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  80  67  65  80  24  34  44  11
1  39  49  80  82  81  69  28  46  70
2  62  83  47  69  75  66  48  43  43
3  77  25   4  52  20  56   3  16  35
4  22  45   6   5  42  43  69  64  34
5  60  33  69  99  24  76  17  72  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items. One way to do this is to iterate through the items and assign them to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring every agent gets a chance to receive items. Here's a suggested allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 1 (value 80), and item 2 (value 67).
2. Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 82).
3. Agent 2 receives item 0 (value 62).
4. Agent 3 receives item 5 (value 56).
5. Agent 4 receives item 6 (value 69).
6. Agent 5 receives item 4 (value 24), item 7 (value 72), and item 8 (value 81).

This allocation considers high-value items and attempts to distribute them fairly among the agents, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item when possible. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 7, 8]
}
```
