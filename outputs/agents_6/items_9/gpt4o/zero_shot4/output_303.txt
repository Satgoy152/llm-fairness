Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  51  92  49  91  15  78  76  78
1  98   8  80  96  12   1  52  75  59
2  55  37  68  41  65   7  26  69  44
3  42  37  24  60  66  15  45  78  50
4   0  49  13  55  31  74  83  10  69
5  36  30  50   4  44  36  69  10  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given that we have 9 items and 6 agents, we'll need to distribute the items such that some agents get more items than others, but overall, the allocation should be fair based on the valuations.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first.
2. After each agent has one item, assign the remaining items to maximize total valuation.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (92), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (98), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (55), but it's already taken, so we allocate item 1 (37) to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (78), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (83), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 6 the highest (69), but it's already taken, so we allocate item 8 (57) to Agent 5.

Now, we have assigned 6 items, with 3 more to allocate. We'll assign them based on remaining high valuations:

- Agent 0 can benefit from item 4 (91), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 3 can benefit from item 3 (60), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 1 can benefit from item 5 (1), but it's very low, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3 since Agent 3 benefits most next.

Now, all 9 items have been allocated. Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7, 3, 5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [8]
}
```
