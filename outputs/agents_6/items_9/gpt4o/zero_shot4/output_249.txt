Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  67  55  70  74  48  68  83  66
1  44  36  37  74  38  38  35  27  21
2  84  31  68  36  37  30  10  30  88
3  89  19  68  71  11  64  47  72  45
4  17  22  95  88  47  29  12  32  30
5  35  30  41  12  16  33  70  32  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that every agent receives at least one item if possible, while maximizing the total valuation.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, as long as no item is duplicated.
2. If any items remain unallocated, assign them to agents who would benefit the most from them in terms of valuation.

Let's perform the allocation based on the given matrix:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 8.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0, but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 3, but that's also taken, so we assign item 2.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2, but it's taken, so assign item 3, which is taken, then item 4.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 8, but it's taken, so assign item 6.

Checking remaining items: 1, 5, 7

Allocate remaining items based on the next highest valuation:

- Agent 0 will take item 1.
- Agent 2 will take item 5.
- Agent 3 will take item 7.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total valuation. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8, 5],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
This allocation satisfies the condition that every item is allocated and each agent receives at least one item.
