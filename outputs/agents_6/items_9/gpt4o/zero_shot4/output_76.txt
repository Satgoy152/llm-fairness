Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  80  21  52  27  69   2   4  34
1  55  56   1  99  80  75  95  19  66
2   8  18  47  96   3  35  78  14  58
3  94  99  98  77  46  60  59   9  57
4  65  56  80  84  14  18  22  11  30
5  23  53  96  23  58  12  87  28  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and that no agent receives fractional items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Sort each agent's valuations for the items and determine which items they value the most.
2. Allocate items one by one, trying to give each agent at least one item they highly value.
3. Adjust to ensure all items are allocated and minimize the difference in total valuation between agents.

Following this strategy, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 8]
- Agent 1 receives items [3]
- Agent 2 receives items [2, 5]
- Agent 3 receives items [1]
- Agent 4 receives items [4]
- Agent 5 receives items [6, 7]

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6, 7]
}
```
