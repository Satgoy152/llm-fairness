Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  16  88  88  61  86  45   9  93
1  22  72  58   7  98   3  77  48  19
2  84  38  21  31  71  72  82  23  99
3  75  91  23  93  93  93  26  19  23
4   9  67   3  86  90  66   6  77  46
5  49  52  99  21  68  24  52  37   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that strives to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will get more than one item.

Let's proceed with an allocation approach:

1. **Assign the item with the highest value for each agent first**, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
2. **Allocate remaining items** based on the highest remaining value to any agent without exceeding the total number of items.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0's highest-valued item is item 0 (96).
- Agent 1's highest-valued item is item 4 (98).
- Agent 2's highest-valued item is item 8 (99).
- Agent 3's highest-valued item is item 3 (93).
- Agent 4's highest-valued item is item 4 (90), but since it's taken, choose next highest: item 7 (77).
- Agent 5's highest-valued item is item 2 (99).

Now, each agent has at least one item. Let's allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 1, 5, 6
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (91) (highest valuation left for item 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (86) (highest valuation left for item 5).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (77) (highest valuation left for item 6).

Now each agent has at least one item, and all items have been assigned.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2]
}
```
