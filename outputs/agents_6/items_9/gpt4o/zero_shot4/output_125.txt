Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  13  90  82   7  48  61  22  93
1  47  51  45  57  13  61  84  92  70
2  15  25  51  40  67  75  16  24  67
3  48   0  51  61  48  20  30  74  69
4  27  77  96  82  58  94   9   9  91
5  20  83  55   5  71  82  81  19   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate each agent's highest valuations for items.
2. Prioritize assignments based on these highest valuations.
3. Ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

Let's go through the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 8 highest (93).
- Agent 1 values item 7 highest (92).
- Agent 2 values item 5 highest (75).
- Agent 3 values item 3 highest (61).
- Agent 4 values item 2 highest (96).
- Agent 5 values item 1 highest (83).

Now, allocate the remaining items while considering the second-highest and subsequent valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (90) is the next best.
- Agent 4: Item 5 (94) is the next best.
- Agent 3: Item 7 (74) is the next best.
- Agent 2: Item 8 (67) is the next best.
- Agent 1: Item 6 (84) is the next best.
- Agent 5: Item 4 (71) is the next best.

Through this allocation method, we ensure that all items are allocated fairly, taking into consideration the highest valuations and distributing items accordingly. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while taking into account the highest preferences of each agent.
