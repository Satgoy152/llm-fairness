Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  30  59  89  32  12  26  20  85
1  26  36  64  99  58  82  51  23  91
2  34  83  57  51   7  12  48  80  83
3  94   7  82  11   7  33   3  68  29
4  29  18  82  99  36  15   3  94  99
5  51  65  44  20  57  84  14  72  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. A fair allocation typically attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring no agent is significantly disadvantaged.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (89), Item 8 (85)
   - Assign items: [3, 8]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (99), Item 8 (91)
   - Assign items: [5] (since Item 3 and 8 are taken, next highest is Item 5)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: Item 1 (83), Item 8 (83)
   - Assign items: [1, 7]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (94), Item 2 (82)
   - Assign items: [0, 2]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value items: Item 3 (99), Item 8 (99)
   - Assign items: [4] (since Item 3 and 8 are taken, next highest is Item 4)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (84), Item 7 (72)
   - Assign items: [6]

Finally, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
