Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  45  40  99  71  92   7  17  71
1  12   1  45  77  72  58  61  88  53
2  46   0  80  81  77  79  12  78  14
3  98  22  60  62  35  67  52  88  10
4   0  89  85  63  44  67   3  63  59
5  53  64  35  78  95  96  50  29  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** First, compute the total valuation each agent has for all items. This helps us understand which agent values the items most and should potentially get more.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:** Start by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most.

3. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item:** To ensure fairness, check if any agent has no items and reassign the least valued items from other agents to those without any items.

4. **Finalize Allocation:** Ensure that all 9 items are allocated and adjust as necessary to fulfill all constraints.

Let's proceed with these steps for allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 3 (98)
   - Item 1: Agent 4 (89)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (80)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (99)
   - Item 4: Agent 5 (95)
   - Item 5: Agent 5 (96)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (61)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (17)
   - Item 8: Agent 5 (97)

2. **Allocate Items to Agents:**
   - Agent 0: [3, 7]
   - Agent 1: [6]
   - Agent 2: [2]
   - Agent 3: [0]
   - Agent 4: [1]
   - Agent 5: [4, 5, 8]

3. **Ensure All Agents Have at Least One Item:**

   In this allocation, each agent has at least one item.

4. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the six agents and each agent receives at least one item.
