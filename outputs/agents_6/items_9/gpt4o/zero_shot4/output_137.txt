Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  76  37  22  78  88  34  50  29
1  10  75  97  12  82  47  37  71   1
2  88  76  75  73  85  39   2  20   5
3  67  89  54  67   9  92  55  49  36
4  36   5  87  39  13  51  11  87  25
5  38  75  76  68  51  17  91  58  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider both the number of items each agent receives and their valuations for the items. A fair allocation could aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent at least one item where possible, prioritizing items with higher valuations for each agent.
2. Distribute any remaining items to maximize fairness in terms of value.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly, so give item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly, so give item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 highly, so give item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly, so give item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly, so give item 7 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 6 highly, so give item 6 to agent 5.

Now each agent has one item. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (3, 4, and 8):

- Agent 1 has a decent value for item 4, so give item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 3 has a decent value for item 3, so give item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 5 has a decent value for item 8, so give item 8 to agent 5.

With this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6, 8]
}
```
