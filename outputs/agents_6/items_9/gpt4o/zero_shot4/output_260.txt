Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  57   2  52  76   3  30   6  54
1   1   8  98  48  55  30  43  39  18
2  82  16  65  44  70  48  92  61  87
3  42  84  27  31  38  91  80  18   3
4   3  63  27  33  55  15  89  42  32
5  28  80  19  91  81  12  91  62  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. Given the valuations, a common approach is to try to maximize the total valuation by assigning items based on the highest value an agent assigns to them. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the highest at 90, so assign item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest at 98, so assign item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the highest at 92, so assign item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the highest at 91, so assign item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 at 89, but item 6 is already assigned. Next highest is item 1 at 63, so assign item 1.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 the highest at 91, so assign item 3.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 4, 7, and 8, ensuring a fair distribution:

7. **Agent 2**: Values item 8 at 87, which is the highest among remaining items, so assign item 8.
8. **Agent 5**: Next highest for unallocated items is item 4 at 81, so assign item 4.
9. **Agent 4**: Assign the remaining item 7.

Now, all agents have been allocated items, and all 9 items have been distributed.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.
