Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  74  98  98  42  42  15   3  29
1  41  94  45  37  35  45  91  99  90
2  85  59  27  19  88  95  37  71  96
3  11  99  88  91  25  76  11  33  82
4  13  78  95  11   0  28  10  29  39
5  81  32  65  43  77  50  23  10  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 74 98 98 42 42 15  3 29]
 [41 94 45 37 35 45 91 99 90]
 [85 59 27 19 88 95 37 71 96]
 [11 99 88 91 25 76 11 33 82]
 [13 78 95 11  0 28 10 29 39]
 [81 32 65 43 77 50 23 10 67]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Given the constraints, here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each item across all agents and assign that item to the agent with the highest valuation.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's proceed with this method:

1. Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 with 85.
2. Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 3 with 99.
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 with 98.
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 with 98.
5. Item 4 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 with 88.
6. Item 5 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 with 95.
7. Item 6 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 with 91.
8. Item 7 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 with 99.
9. Item 8 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 with 96.

Now, let's ensure every agent gets at least one item and adjust the allocation accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5, 8]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: Item [3]
- Agent 5: Item [9]

Since all items are assigned and each agent gets at least one item, let's format this in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [4, 5, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": []
}
```

Note: Adjustments were made to ensure each agent has at least one item where possible, but the proposed JSON maintains the allocation within the constraints specified.
