Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  88   4  84  40  94  42  53  94
1  85  64  47  45  20  97   6   7  13
2  65  78  28  95  59   7  13  41  42
3  37  71  18  99  19  78  54  85  13
4  33  50  97  63  11  24  15  81  31
5  44  95  62  94  70  77  34  51  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to give each agent items that they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. There are 9 items and 6 agents, so some agents will get 1 item, and some will get 2 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (94). We'll allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5, but it's already allocated. So, we'll allocate item 0 (85), which is their second-highest valuation.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (95). We'll allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3, but it's already allocated. So, we'll allocate item 7 (85), which is their second-highest valuation.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2 (97). We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 1 (95). We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 5.

Now, 6 items are allocated, and 3 items remain (4, 6, and 8). We'll distribute these remaining items to the agents based on their next highest valuations:

- Agent 0 also values item 8 highly (94). We'll allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
- Agent 5 also values item 4 highly (70). We'll allocate item 4 to Agent 5.
- Agent 3 values item 6 (54) relatively highly among the remaining options. We'll allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

After this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent has been assigned:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```
