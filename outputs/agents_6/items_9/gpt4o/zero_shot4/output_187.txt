Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  52  76   7  46  59  46  90  83
1  98  50  86   6  89  96  10  56  72
2  51   4  29  52  98  33  32  77  10
3  84   7  44  73   9  36  34  21  99
4  43  84  54  61   4  16  56  52  25
5  44  74  37  70   8  18  61  42  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 9 items are allocated in total. Below is the allocation plan based on maximizing individual agent's values for the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that have relatively higher values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that have relatively higher values for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that have relatively higher values for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that have relatively higher values for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items that have relatively higher values for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate items that have relatively higher values for Agent 5.

With this strategy, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 8 the highest, but since it is already allocated to Agent 0, the next highest is item 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 5 values item 3 highly, but since it is allocated to Agent 3, the next highest available is item 7.

By considering the above observations, let's allocate the items:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to only one agent, all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives the items they value relatively higher while ensuring an integer number of items per agent.
