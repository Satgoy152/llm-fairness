Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  35  74  99  68  68  13  52  22
1  57  56  38   2  28  51  87  57   8
2  59  22  49  37  72  87  84  68  52
3  92  17  16  15  97  40  59  18  50
4  75   5  61  40  48   5  11  76  23
5  51  75  81  95  97  29  63  66  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives to ensure a fair distribution.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Create a list of all items with their respective valuations for each agent.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on the valuation.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than a fair share of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Construct a list of (item, agent, valuation) tuples.
2. Sort the list by valuation in descending order.
3. Allocate items to agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than two items (since there are 6 agents and 9 items, some agents will get 1 item while others might get 2).

After going through the list, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
