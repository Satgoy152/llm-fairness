Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  28  15  44  67  35   0  94  20
1  90   4  46   5   1  59  48  85   3
2  98  45  29  82   9  71  67  17  93
3   4  32  20  35  62  88  86  17  97
4   5  85  41  72  23  22  72  92  28
5  68   5  43  82  56  44  32  79  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. The goal is to distribute all 9 items fairly based on the agents' valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's assign item 7 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value (94) for them.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value (90) for them.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it has a good value (29) and avoids conflict with higher-priority items for others.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 8 to Agent 3, as it has the highest value (97) for them.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 1 to Agent 4, as it has the highest value (85) for them.
6. **Agent 5**: Assign item 3 to Agent 5, as it has a high value (82) for them.

For the remaining items, we can assign them to minimize conflicts and distribute them fairly:

7. Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as it has the second-highest value (62) for them.
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it has a high value (71) for them.
9. Assign item 6 to Agent 4, as it has a good value (72) for them.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [8, 4],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item where possible, based on their valuations.
