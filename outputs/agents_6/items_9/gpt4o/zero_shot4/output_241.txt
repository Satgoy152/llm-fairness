Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  53  96  61  84  24  68  40  22
1  43  81  69  88  44  24  78  92  15
2  40  50  52   3  99  38  10  86  82
3  91   0  93  37  80  72  29  51  80
4  10  59  93  55  34  74  89  58  84
5  25  24  71  77  49  31  44  56  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We also need to allocate exactly 9 items in total.

Let's start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 96.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the most at 92.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 99.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most at 91.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most at 93. Since item 2 is already allocated, we assign item 6, which has the next highest value at 89.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the most at 77.

Now, we've allocated 6 items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. We need to allocate 3 more items.

Let's allocate the remaining items to maximize the total valuation:

1. Agent 0 can receive item 1 (value 53).
2. Agent 3 can receive item 8 (value 80).
3. Agent 4 can receive item 5 (value 74).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [6, 5],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents, maximizing overall valuations while respecting the constraints.
