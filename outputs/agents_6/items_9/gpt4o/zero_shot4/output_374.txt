Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  63  18  48  95  99  17  83   9
1  46  41  44  84   7  37  94   6   6
2  42   2  21  26  63  10  86  12  60
3  98  26  41  48  69  70   4  25  45
4  50  69  29  10  84  65  81  37  23
5   6  94   8  87  28  84  26   2  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 
2. If conflicts arise (i.e., one agent ends up with too many items), reassign based on the next highest valuations and balance the number of items per agent.

Following these principles, we will allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 (value 98)
- Item 1: Agent 5 (value 94)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (value 44)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 84)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 95)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 99)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (value 94)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (value 83)
- Item 8: Agent 2 (value 60)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, and no agent gets too many items. After balancing, the allocation could be adjusted as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with some agents getting more based on their highest valuations while ensuring every agent has a fair chance.
