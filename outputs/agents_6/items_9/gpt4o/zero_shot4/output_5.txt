Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  20  82  84  50  24  15  23  41
1  33   8  70  16  11  40  59  14  54
2  80  84   8  65  42  13  30  24  24
3   8  91  66  37   0  99  42  99  68
4  40  99  66  27  39  17  94  90  59
5  19  80  74  45  12  23  77  18  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents while considering their valuations, we can employ a method that tries to ensure each agent gets items they value higher than others. We will also make sure every agent gets a whole number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are highest for items 2 and 3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for items 0 and 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for items 0 and 1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for items 1, 5, and 7. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are highest for items 1 and 6, both already assigned. Assign item 7 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Valuations are highest for items 1 and 2, both already assigned. Assign item 5 to Agent 5.

Next, assign the remaining items:

- Item 3 is unassigned and has high values for Agent 0. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Item 4 is unassigned and has a moderate value for Agent 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Item 8 is unassigned and has a moderate value for Agent 3. Assign item 8 to Agent 3.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [7, 4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.
