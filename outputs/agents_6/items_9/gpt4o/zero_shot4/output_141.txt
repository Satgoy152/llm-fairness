Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  42   0  91  55  42   5  84  29
1  29  97  56  32  34  50  48  80  99
2  70  14  23   8  82  80  27  68  36
3  73  57  52  61  71  85  67  56  23
4  87  57  89  61  34  98  66  92  82
5  39   0  38  37  66  40  37  69  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the overall valuation, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, given there are 6 agents and 9 items.

Let's organize the allocation by examining each agent's highest valuation of unallocated items, ensuring no agent receives more than two items initially, given the constraint.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value for unallocated items: Item 3 (91), Item 0 (84)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value for unallocated items: Item 8 (99), Item 1 (97)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value for unallocated items: Item 4 (82), Item 5 (80)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value for unallocated items: Item 5 (85), Item 4 (71)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value for unallocated items: Item 5 (98), Item 7 (92)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest value for unallocated items: Item 4 (66), Item 7 (69)

After analyzing the valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 8
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 7
- Agent 5: Item 6

We still have items 0, 1, 2 left for allocation. Let's allocate them to agents with the next highest valuations while ensuring each agent's allocation remains feasible.

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 2

Now the allocations are complete, and each item is allocated without violating the constraints. Here is the json with the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6]
}
```
