Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  45  46  55  43   5  98  23  91
1  65   0  71  14  12  89  61  13  50
2  37  40  83  63  67  78  33  46  72
3  44  48  51  56  45  51  97  27  83
4  80  11  10  40  47   3  41  44  65
5  66  65  60  14  79  56  23  93  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, I will use the method of maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This method tries to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Identify the highest value each agent assigns to any item and allocate those items first, if possible.
2. Continue assigning items to agents based on the next highest valuation they have for unallocated items.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item before assigning additional items to any agent.
4. Ensure all items are allocated.

Using this approach, we can derive the following allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highly, so assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly, so assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, so assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 8 highly, so assign item 8 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly, so assign item 0 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 7 highly, so assign item 7 to agent 5.

Now, all agents have received at least one item. We'll continue by allocating the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations and ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 3 values item 6 highly (already allocated), but next highest is item 3, so assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly (next highest), so assign item 4 to agent 5.
- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (next highest), so assign item 1 to agent 0.

Now, all 9 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8, 3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed based on the agents' valuations.
