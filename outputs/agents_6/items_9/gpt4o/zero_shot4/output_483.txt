Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95   0  99  36  41   0  10  97  83
1  92   5  83  85  25  95  49  19  46
2  96  62  60  25  38   1  10  17  43
3  25   7  66  62  45  45  78  71  37
4  48  39  36  51  26   4  16  80   9
5  96   8  47  61  58  32  39  55  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will try to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring all 9 items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 2, and 7 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 0 highly, but itâ€™s already taken by Agent 0, so we'll assign them items 1 and 8.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly, but it's already taken by Agent 0, so we'll assign them items 4.
- Agent 5 values items 3 and 5 highly, but item 5 is already taken by Agent 1, so we'll assign them item 3.

Based on this strategy, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, and all 9 items are distributed.
