Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  38  86   1   4  27  82  21  39
1  54  74  96  43  36  39  89  54  22
2  94  88  57  11  62  89  15  78  29
3  79  41  41  22  93  40  92   9  52
4  13  55  82  58  48  29  74  69  39
5  26  89  34  31  26  58  57  21  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We should ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no agent should receive more than necessary to meet the total of 9 items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for agent 0 are item 2 (86) and item 6 (82). Let's allocate items 2 and 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for agent 1 is item 2 (96), but it's already taken. The next highest are items 6 (89) and 1 (74). Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for agent 2 is item 0 (94). Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for agent 3 is item 4 (93). Allocate item 4 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for agent 4 is item 2 (82), but it's taken. The next highest is item 7 (69). Allocate item 7 to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for agent 5 is item 1 (89), but it's taken. The next highest are items 5 (58) and 8 (53). Allocate item 5 to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 7 items. Let's allocate the remaining two items:

7. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 (43) to agent 1, as it is one of the higher remaining values for agent 1.

8. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 8 (52) to agent 3, as it is the next highest remaining value for agent 3.

Now, all 9 items are allocated. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
