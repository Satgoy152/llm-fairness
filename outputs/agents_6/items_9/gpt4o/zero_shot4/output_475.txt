Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  57  51  85  28  83  26  13  64
1  69  73  59  97  35  54  62  30  64
2  35  98  38  63  97  39  29  76  72
3  50  15  24  83  82  25  49  46   2
4  96  22  18  39  97  37  21  22  93
5  34  24  90  21  77  49  70  51  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated. A common approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, trying to balance the overall distribution to ensure fairness.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (value 96).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 98).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 5 (value 90).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 97).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 97).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 83).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 5 (value 70).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 76).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 1 (value 64).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations while ensuring each item is assigned.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [1, 4, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```
