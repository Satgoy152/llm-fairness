Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  87  94  92  86  87  15  66  34
1  37  13  64  33  49  15  99  43   6
2  13  33  29  55  79  54  46  38  91
3  52  88  12  69  89  72  80  80  72
4  84  39  94  47  98  92  25  75  38
5  81  55  70  74  91  32  55   8  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's one way of doing it:

1. Agent 0:
   - Values for items: [24, 87, 94, 92, 86, 87, 15, 66, 34]
   - Highest value items: 2, 3, 1

2. Agent 1:
   - Values for items: [37, 13, 64, 33, 49, 15, 99, 43, 6]
   - Highest value items: 6, 0, 2

3. Agent 2:
   - Values for items: [13, 33, 29, 55, 79, 54, 46, 38, 91]
   - Highest value items: 8, 4, 3

4. Agent 3:
   - Values for items: [52, 88, 12, 69, 89, 72, 80, 80, 72]
   - Highest value items: 1, 4, 6

5. Agent 4:
   - Values for items: [84, 39, 94, 47, 98, 92, 25, 75, 38]
   - Highest value items: 4, 2, 5

6. Agent 5:
   - Values for items: [81, 55, 70, 74, 91, 32, 55, 8, 84]
   - Highest value items: 4, 0, 8

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 5 (value 81 for Agent 5, highest among unallocated).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (value 88 for Agent 3).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 4 (value 94 for Agent 4).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 92 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (value 89 for Agent 3).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 4 (value 92 for Agent 4).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (value 99 for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (value 66 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 2 (value 91 for Agent 2).

Ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and that the allocation is fair and maximizes value for the agents, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [0]
}
```
