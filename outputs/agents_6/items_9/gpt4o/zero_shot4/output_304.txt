Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  10  46  18   2  75  79   4  55
1  85   8  34  64  22  90  19  84  12
2  44  47   6  59  76  91  97   9  83
3  10  88  30  76   1  39  55  90  78
4  37  98  60  93  54  51  14  27  80
5  79  79  12  47  87  21  48  56  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. We will attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring fairness.

Let's start the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 6. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 and 7. Since item 5 is highly valued by multiple agents and we want to spread high-value items fairly, let's allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 5 and 6. Again, item 5 is highly competitive, so let's give item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 7. Since item 7 is already allocated, let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** has a very high valuation for item 1. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5** has high valuations for items 4 and 0, but item 0 is already taken. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 5.

Now, the remaining items are 2, 5, and 8. Let's allocate them based on the remaining high valuations:

7. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 as it maximizes their valuation further.
8. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4 as it fits their remaining capacity.
9. Allocate item 8 to Agent 3 as a fair distribution approach.

After this process, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has some items, and all 9 items are distributed.
