Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  13  91  91  68  34  70  87  38
1  49  20   3  32  46   0  50  48  97
2  76  91  44   4  77  43  43  16  49
3  71  89  93  28  60  38   4  34  85
4  15  51  13  11  97  68  38  82   9
5  74  27  13  39  82  56  92  42  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. This is a classic problem often referred to as the "assignment problem," where we aim to optimize the distribution of items to maximize fairness or total utility.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, 3, and 7**. To maximize fairness, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1 values item 8 the highest**. Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1**. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3 values item 2 and 3 highly**. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4 values item 4 the highest**. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5 values item 6 the highest**. Allocate item 6 to Agent 5.

After these allocations, we have allocated 6 out of the 9 items. We still need to allocate items 3, 5, and 7. 

7. **Agent 0 already has item 0, but also values item 3 highly**. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 5 has a good valuation for item 5**. Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

9. **Agent 0 also has a good valuation for item 7**. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

Now all 9 items are allocated, and the allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item where possible, maximizing their valuation as much as possible.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
