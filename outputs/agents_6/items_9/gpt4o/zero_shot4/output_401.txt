Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  94  48  42  50  84  20  91  67
1  34  92  78   3  31  50  53  38  88
2  93  82  56  17  96   6  94  92  10
3  33  22  51  27  77  62  49  70  18
4  70  98   6  54  89  68  79  61  28
5   0  92  49  99  24  23  94  11  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them based on each agent's valuations, ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable total value from their assigned items. Keeping in mind that there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 8.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations for items 4 and 6.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 7.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 4, but already assigned to Agent 2, so we consider item 1.
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation for item 3.

Allocating items based on these considerations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 8.
- Agent 2 gets items 4 and 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 7.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.
- Agent 5 gets item 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```
