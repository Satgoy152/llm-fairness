Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  22  87  63  53  23  51  84  41
1  78  37   2  34  20  18   9  97  47
2  85  57  63  36  69  90  26   8  48
3  51  33  12  32  59  71  50  22  78
4  72  86  53  57  49  36  36  66  18
5  27  81  33  87  14  92  79  27  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's values for the items and ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their satisfaction while distributing all items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than a fair share of the total.

After analyzing the given valuations, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 0 (valuations 87 and 65)
- Agent 1: Items 7 and 1 (valuations 97 and 37)
- Agent 2: Items 5 and 6 (valuations 90 and 26)
- Agent 3: Item 8 (valuation 78)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (valuation 49)
- Agent 5: Item 3 (valuation 87)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item while maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
