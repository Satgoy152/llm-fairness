Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  15  42  27  56  21  12  64  45
1  31  24  81  14  93  94   1  82  83
2  51  27  50  13  71  76  22  19  77
3  54  11  34  93  18  21  13  36  96
4  59  27  77  84  23   9  51  62  68
5  49  53  84  76  78  64  75  99  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items such that every agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly nine.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate these high-value items to the corresponding agents if possible.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
4. Adjust allocations to make sure all 9 items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 7 most (64).
- Agent 1 values item 5 most (94).
- Agent 2 values item 5 most (76).
- Agent 3 values item 8 most (96).
- Agent 4 values item 0 most (59).
- Agent 5 values item 7 most (99).

Now, let's allocate:

1. Give item 7 to agent 5, as it is their highest value.
2. Give item 5 to agent 1, as it is their highest value.
3. Give item 8 to agent 3, as it is their highest value.
4. Give item 0 to agent 4, as it is their highest value.

Now, we have 5 items left to allocate (1, 2, 3, 4, 6). Let's distribute them considering the remaining agents' preferences:

- Agent 0: Items 1 (15), 2 (42), 3 (27), 4 (56), 6 (12)
- Agent 2: Items 1 (27), 2 (50), 3 (13), 4 (71), 6 (22)

To balance:

5. Give item 2 to agent 0 (42), as it's their second highest value.
6. Give item 4 to agent 2 (71), as it's their second highest value.
7. Give item 1 to agent 0 (15).
8. Give item 6 to agent 2 (22).
9. Give item 3 to agent 0 (27).

This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7]
}
```
