Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  92  26  59  31  34  83   5  33
1  93  93  14  14   4  76  93  83  88
2   9   7  63  58  82  50  48  64  70
3  39  85  42  23   4  44  77   0  55
4   6  92  15   5  92  10  25  31  73
5  38  33  52  72  15  20   5  25  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a somewhat equitable share based on their valuations. We'll try to allocate items by considering the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate these items:

Let's follow a strategy where we look at each agent's highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet and distribute accordingly. This approach aims to maximize individual satisfaction and fairness.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (93).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (82).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (85), but it is already allocated, so next is item 6 (77).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (92), but it is already allocated, so next is item 8 (73).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (72).

Now, let's check the remaining unallocated items: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8

Continuing the allocation for remaining items:
- Allocate remaining items based on second highest preference or availability.

With these considerations, we allocate items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to give each agent their most valued items wherever possible while ensuring each agent gets some allocation and all items are distributed.
