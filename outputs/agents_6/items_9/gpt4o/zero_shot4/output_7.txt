Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  46  33  24  30  48  14  86  41
1  67   3  53  13  79  97  83  34  35
2  24  53  31   3  36  43  45   1  51
3   6   4  22  74  68  20   3  71  97
4  60   2  29  17  48  81  88  93   4
5  17  96  40  61  99  86  51  16  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values that each agent places on the items. An optimal allocation would attempt to maximize the total satisfaction or value across all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Given the valuations, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that they value highly. Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 7] (Values: 85, 86)
- Agent 1: Items [5] (Value: 97)
- Agent 2: Items [8] (Value: 51)
- Agent 3: Items [3] (Value: 74)
- Agent 4: Items [6] (Value: 88)
- Agent 5: Items [1, 4, 2] (Values: 96, 99, 40)

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. The allocation aims to give each agent items they value highly.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 4, 2]
}
```
