Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  68  39  23  18  86  98  70  24
1  90  66  58  56  40  66  69   5  79
2  55   1  63  98  57  44  36  36  16
3  93  88  89  79   3  93  60  11  99
4   4  63  66   8  26  84   6  70  66
5  23  57  18  47  31  54  32  40  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total satisfaction based on the valuations provided while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Hereâ€™s a suggested allocation strategy:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent first:**
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (Value: 98)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (Value: 90)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (Value: 98)
   - Agent 3: Item 8 (Value: 99)
   - Agent 4: Item 5 (Value: 84)
   - Agent 5: Item 8 (Value: 60) [Already taken by agent 3, choose next highest available]
   - Agent 5: Item 1 (Value: 57)

2. **Assign remaining items based on the next highest available value:**
   - Remaining items: 2, 4, 7
   - Agent 0: Item 7 (Value: 70)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (Value: 58)
   - Agent 4: Item 4 (Value: 26)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total of 9 items is distributed among the agents.
