Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58   7  63  71  88  67  68  24   4
1  90  68  94  37  94  86  50  34  93
2  96   4  30  99  79  76  53  36  91
3  49  40  92  92  97  92  21  85  73
4  54  44  89  82  14  89   7  83  81
5  50  45  91  64  17  37  25  58  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for each agent to get the items they value the most, while ensuring that every item is allocated and no item is allocated more than once. Let's proceed by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. If there's a tie (i.e., two or more agents value an item equally and at the highest value), we can break it by any reasonable means such as choosing the agent with fewer items assigned at that point or by a predefined order.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 68.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 94, but Agent 1 already has items, so let's assign this to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 86.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 68.
8. Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most at 85.
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most at 93.

After this initial allocation, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 5, 8
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items

Now, let's ensure that each agent ends up with a fair share by redistributing if necessary. We can adjust the allocations slightly to ensure no agent has an undue advantage while maintaining the fairness of the overall distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3
- Agent 3: Items 7, 1
- Agent 4: Item 8
- Agent 5: No items

Finally, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [7, 1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": []
}
```
