Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  32  35  43   5   3  44  93  36
1  26  25  50  79  98  56  32  26  68
2  31  21  44   2  71  41  75  29  34
3   1  93  16  79  95  37  88  50   3
4  12  50   9  58   3  47  25  98  36
5  96  95  66  92  46  31  43  78  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. A common approach is to consider the preferences or valuations of the agents for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (91).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (98).
3. Agent 2 values item 6 highly (75).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly (93).
5. Agent 4 values item 7 highly (98).
6. Agent 5 values item 5 highly (31).

Now, we have 3 more items to allocate, trying to distribute them such that remaining high values are considered:

7. Agent 3 also values item 3 highly (79).
8. Agent 5 values item 2 highly (66).
9. Agent 0 values item 8 (36).

Thus, each agent gets at least one item, and we have allocated all 9 items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
