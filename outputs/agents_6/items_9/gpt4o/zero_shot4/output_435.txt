Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56   9  15  99  22  70  49  45  29
1  37  97  64   1  59  52  47  22  89
2  18   4  33  87   6  98   2  66  78
3  37  83  99  95  13  71  59  39  17
4  91  79  83  11  84   1   7  61  76
5   7   2  19  59  38  35  15  10  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent based on their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with relatively high value to them. We have 9 items and 6 agents, so some agents will receive more than one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 99).
2. Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 97).
3. Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 98).
4. Agent 3 gets item 2 (value 99).
5. Agent 4 gets item 0 (value 91).
6. Agent 5 gets items 4, 6, 7, and 8 (values 38, 15, 10, and 28 respectively).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items with relatively high personal value, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4, 6, 7, 8]
}
```
