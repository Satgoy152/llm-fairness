Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66   3  23  85  12  99  33  64  40
1  48  34  88  56  95  48  35  74  33
2  78  51  44  58  84  68  53  36   5
3  57  16   2  38  39  51   0  51  23
4  95  89  39  52  97  19  64  31  15
5  11  77  91  73  68  18  94  64  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share. We'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly among the agents:

1. First, identify the highest-valued items for each agent and allocate those items to them if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, given that there are more items than agents.
3. Allocate remaining items to agents that will benefit the most, balancing the total value received by each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (value 99), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (value 95), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (value 78), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, but it's already allocated, so allocate item 3 (value 38) to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest, but it's already allocated, so allocate item 0 (value 95) to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 2 the highest (value 91), so allocate item 2 to agent 5.

Now, distribute the remaining items to balance the allocations:

- Remaining items: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Allocate item 1 (value 77) to agent 5 (highest value among remaining).
- Allocate item 6 (value 64) to agent 4 (highest value among remaining).
- Allocate item 7 (value 74) to agent 1 (highest value among remaining).
- Allocate item 8 (value 40) to agent 0 (highest value among remaining).

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
