Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  41  87  39  82  33  76  72  83
1  95  86  90  56  36  13  62  77  22
2  28  52  92  51  88  42  56  19  72
3  52  12  43  90  83  80  78  87   9
4  17  64  85  95  47  69  99  11  62
5   6  10  55  32   7  31  56  85   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items based on the valuations given, ensuring no agent is left out and all items are allocated. The goal is to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (value 87)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 95)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (value 88)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 90)
- Agent 4: Items 6, 5 (values 99, 69)
- Agent 5: Items 7, 8, 1 (values 85, 8, 10)

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 5],
    "5": [7, 8, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated in total.
