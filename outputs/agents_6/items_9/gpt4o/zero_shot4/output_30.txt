Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  93  95  38  96  34  33  22  32
1  90  50  62  95  88   8  30  24   8
2  78  97  13  49  15  95  87  45  99
3  25   7  76  83  12   6  73  98  11
4  78   1  17  76  65   8  78  37  45
5  24  24  33  30  94  91   7  29  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that considers the agents' valuations. One possible approach is to allocate items to agents based on maximizing their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure all agents get at least one item if possible.

Following these steps, the allocation could be:

- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 1 (Valuation: 90)
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 2 (Valuation: 97)
- Item 2: Assigned to Agent 0 (Valuation: 95)
- Item 3: Assigned to Agent 1 (Valuation: 95)
- Item 4: Assigned to Agent 0 (Valuation: 96)
- Item 5: Assigned to Agent 2 (Valuation: 95)
- Item 6: Assigned to Agent 3 (Valuation: 73)
- Item 7: Assigned to Agent 3 (Valuation: 98)
- Item 8: Assigned to Agent 2 (Valuation: 99)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 5, 8]
- Agent 3: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: []

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and that agents who have the highest valuations for particular items receive them. Notably, Agent 4 and Agent 5 do not receive any items because their valuations were lower compared to the top valuations for each item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 5, 8],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
