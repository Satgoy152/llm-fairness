Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  96  38  35  70  72  36   6  42
1   8  42  37  43  94  23  86  47  78
2  59  40  37  65  49  84  49  54  92
3  81  22  31  94  80  32  61  95  25
4  75  50  19  18  34  69   6  41  23
5  39  46  47  52  13  67  80  32  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the 9 items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, we'll consider a strategy to allocate items based on the highest values that agents have for the items, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

We start by assigning the highest value items to each agent, ensuring that each one gets at least one. We'll then distribute any remaining items based on the next highest available value:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item: 1 (value 96)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item: 4 (value 94)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item: 8 (value 92)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item: 3 (value 94)
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item: 0 (value 75)
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item: 6 (value 80)

After assigning one item to each agent, we have used 6 items (1, 4, 8, 3, 0, 6). We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (2, 5, 7).

Next, we assign the remaining items by choosing the highest remaining value for each:

- For item 2, the highest unassigned value is with Agent 5 (value 47).
- For item 5, the highest unassigned value is with Agent 2 (value 84).
- For item 7, the highest unassigned value is with Agent 3 (value 95).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated efficiently based on the given valuations. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [8, 5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6, 2]
}
```
