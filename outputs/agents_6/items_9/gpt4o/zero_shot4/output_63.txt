Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  12  69  97  63  75   2  98  48
1  27   9  88  22   5   0  80  34  13
2  86  23  21  89  95  86  91  75  56
3  38  26  33  44  94  22  43  80   8
4  95  47  81  59  43  43   1  12   7
5  86  62  27  48  93  40  83   2  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to assign items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced as much as possible. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: 3, 7 (97, 98)
   - Allocate items 3 and 7 to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 2, 6 (88, 80)
   - Allocate items 2 and 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 4, 0 (95, 86)
   - Allocate items 4 and 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 7, 4 (80, 94)
   - Allocate items 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value items: 0, 2 (95, 81)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest value items: 0, 4 (86, 93)
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 5.

This allocation gives each agent items based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8]
}
```

This allocation uses all 9 items, and each agent receives at least one item.
