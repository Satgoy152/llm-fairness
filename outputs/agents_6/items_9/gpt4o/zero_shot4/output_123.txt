Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  35  11  16  34  62  21  25  36
1  86   3  80  49  82  19  72   9  43
2  85   3  64  72  98  16  54  86  60
3  54  81  20  35  28  54  50  28  32
4  95  63  72  65  68  12  69  39  14
5  26  70  68  45  35  88  64  78  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. We'll consider each agent's valuation for each item and attempt to distribute items so that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's one potential way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 might value item 5 highly.
- Agent 1 can benefit from item 0.
- Agent 2 might find item 4 valuable.
- Agent 3 might value item 1 highly.
- Agent 4 could benefit from item 2.
- Agent 5 might find item 3 valuable.

Balancing the allocations while ensuring all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: Items 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6
- Agent 2: Items 4, 7
- Agent 3: Items 1
- Agent 4: Items 2
- Agent 5: Items 3, 8

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets to maximize their value while all 9 items are distributed fairly.
