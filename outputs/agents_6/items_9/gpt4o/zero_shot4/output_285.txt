Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  94  20  90  87  42  76  22  89
1  81  56  35   2  63  41  74  50  61
2  11  25  91  72  95  16  36  66  14
3  36  26   5  33  17  75  49  98   6
4  64   9  57  71  10  82  63  65  68
5   4  19  27  91  62  60  30  82  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that balances both the total value each agent receives and the number of items each agent gets. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates the highest value item to each agent sequentially until all items are allocated. However, in this scenario, with only 9 items and 6 agents, we must ensure each agent receives at least one item when possible.

We will aim to allocate items such that the total value each agent gets is relatively balanced, while also attempting to distribute the number of items fairly. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. Agent 0 gets item 1 and item 3.
2. Agent 1 gets item 0.
3. Agent 2 gets item 4.
4. Agent 3 gets item 7.
5. Agent 4 gets item 5 and item 8.
6. Agent 5 gets item 2 and item 6.

This allocation considers both the value each agent places on items and attempts to balance the number of items distributed among the agents, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 8],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the requirement of allocating all 9 items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
