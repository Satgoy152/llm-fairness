Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  32  85  71  10  14  84  95  20
1  51  10  25  62  20  39  78  29  63
2  25  96  16  20   0  60  32  52  35
3  65  14  91  45  94   3  36  38  90
4  74  96  66  65  44  21  33  35  93
5  97  32  31  72  77  97  59  23  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) across all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that we have 9 items and 6 agents, a balanced distribution would involve some agents getting more items than others.

Let's look at each agent's highest priority items based on their valuations and allocate accordingly while ensuring each item is given to only one agent.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Identify each agent's highest valued items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their valuations, ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure a total of 9 items are distributed.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 7 (95) and item 2 (85). Allocate item 7.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (51) and 8 (63). Allocate item 8.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (96). Allocate item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (94). Allocate item 4.
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (74) and item 1 (96), but item 1 is taken. Allocate item 0.
- **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (97). Allocate item 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (85), which is their next highest valuation among unallocated items.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (45), which is their next highest valuation among unallocated items.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 6 (33), which is their next highest valuation among unallocated items.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent gets at least one item wherever possible, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. Each item is allocated to only one agent, aligning with the constraints provided.
