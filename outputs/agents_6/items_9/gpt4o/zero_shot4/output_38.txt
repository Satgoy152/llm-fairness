Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  94  78  91  81  19  57  90  62
1  14  47   7  23  50  83  30  95  55
2  46  45  11  35  59  12  61  84  52
3  55  23  24  45  63  29  89  63  10
4  35  62  53  64  69  96   3  72  97
5   4  29  71   2  18  32  22  14  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 5, 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 6, 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 0, 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Has high valuations for items 5, 8.
6. **Agent 5**: Has high valuations for items 2, 8.

Attempt to allocate based on maximizing total value for each agent:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 64) since it has a high valuation compared to others.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 94) for the same reason.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (value 71) as it is the highest value among agents.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 91) as it is the highest value among agents.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value 69) as it is the highest value among agents.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (value 96) as it is the highest value among agents.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 89) as it is the highest value among agents.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 95) as it is the highest value among agents.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 4 (value 97) as it is the highest value among agents.

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to an agent that values it highly, maximizing satisfaction as best as possible. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 5, 8],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the condition of allocating exactly 9 items among the agents.
