Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  51  77  91  67  63  24  81  96
1  73   1  28  46   0  18  95  75  78
2   2  82  75  78  96  85  95  64  50
3  18  23  35  50  32  23  39  96   4
4  98  36  94  87  98  70  21  24  74
5   7  36   7  13  59  17  94  84  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm to ensure each agent gets at least one item while maximizing their total value. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest value item for each agent if possible.
2. Then, distribute the rest of the items to maximize the total value for each agent.

Based on the table provided, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 3 and 8 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 4 values items 0 and 4 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 6 the most.

Given the constraints, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 8],
    "5": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.
