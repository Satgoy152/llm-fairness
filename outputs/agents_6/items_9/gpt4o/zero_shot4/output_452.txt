Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  70  39  75  94  93  79  72  27
1  56  74  98  22  13  98  38   1  42
2  62  38  16  32  62  74  81  12  73
3  28  89  45  96  44  95  55  95  94
4  52   4  16   6  18  98  50  86  68
5  25  86  57  14  29  87  63  76  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Assign each agent to their highest valued item first, if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Distribute any remaining items in a way that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (94).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (98).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (81).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (96).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (98).
- Agent 5 values item 8 the most (98).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agents 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have all received one item. We now have items 0, 1, and 7 left.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as it has a high value for them (64).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 as it has a high value for them (89).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 5 as it has a high value for them (76).

The allocation would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [8, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed in a way that considers agents' valuations. Note that the total number of items allocated is 9, as required.
