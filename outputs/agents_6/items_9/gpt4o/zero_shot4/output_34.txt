Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  61  81  58   6  72  25  36  55
1  28  84   7   7  60  75  61  77  53
2  72  79  52   8  66  48   7  96  16
3  33  63  31  64  67  19  13  88  89
4  31  68  39  83  49  37  68  21  96
5  46  10  82  39  60  27  13  56  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and ensure that each agent gets as fair a distribution as possible. Given that there are 6 agents and 9 items, a fair distribution would aim to evenly distribute the items while considering the agents' preferences as reflected in their valuations.

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Prioritize giving each agent at least one item.
2. Allocate items based on the highest value an agent has for an item, ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Has very high valuation for item 0.
- **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 1.
- **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 7.
- **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 8.
- **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 3.
- **Agent 5**: High valuation for item 2.

After these initial allocations, we have:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 7.
- Agent 3 gets item 8.
- Agent 4 gets item 3.
- Agent 5 gets item 2.

Now, we have three items left (4, 5, 6) and need to distribute them.

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (second-highest valuation).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations where possible.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [2]
}
```
