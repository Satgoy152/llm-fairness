Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  12  94  92  83  77  11  41  13
1  90  17  91  48  47  52  20  72  44
2   8  54  83  88  27  43   1  62  16
3  59  87  40  40  50  21  17  56  43
4  89  59  11  43  94  83  72  52  95
5  50  54  45  73  30  18  91  41  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to give each agent items that they value highly, ensuring that the total number of allocated items is exactly 9. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives Item 2 and Item 3, which are highly valued by them.
2. Agent 1 receives Item 0 and Item 8, as these are among their higher valuations.
3. Agent 2 receives Item 1, which is one of the higher valued items for them.
4. Agent 3 receives Item 4, which is one of the highest valued items for them.
5. Agent 4 receives Item 5, which they value quite highly.
6. Agent 5 receives Item 6 and Item 7, which are relatively higher in their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents while taking into account their valuations as best as possible.
