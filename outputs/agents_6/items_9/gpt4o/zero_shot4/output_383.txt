Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  10  69  39  65  30  10  23  35
1  55  93  68  70  39   6  21  21  41
2  53  51  58  13  38  50  60  28  19
3  77  85  42  51   5  32  12  90  54
4  70  75  65  95  98  56  88  50  45
5  24  55  37  50  34  31  39  39  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. A typical approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we iteratively assign the most valued item to the agent who values it the most, then proceed with the next highest valued item and so on, making sure each agent ends up with at least one item because the number of agents and items might not match perfectly.

Given there are 9 items and 6 agents, one approach is to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and then distribute the remaining items based on who values them the most. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent one item they value highly.
2. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the total valuation.

Here's a feasible allocation using this method:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item, maximizing their valuations as much as possible.
