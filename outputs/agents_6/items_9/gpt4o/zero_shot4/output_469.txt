Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  39   4  64  60   8  97  65  33
1  12  32  36  62  20   0  31  82  31
2  14  65  54  54  60   1  17  70  70
3  79  67  18  19  37  44  40  15  10
4  27  58  33  38  68  68  73   3  58
5  99  43  78  16  84  83  96  89  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are distributed.

One approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible, and avoiding giving all items to one or two agents only. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are highest for item 6 (97) and item 3 (64).
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for item 7 (82).
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for items 8 (70) and item 1 (65).
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for item 0 (79).
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are highest for item 6 (73), but it is already taken, so we choose item 4 (68).
6. **Agent 5**: Valuations are highest for item 5 (83) and item 2 (78).

Now, let's allocate these items while ensuring each item is given to only one agent:

- **Agent 0**: [6, 3]
- **Agent 1**: [7]
- **Agent 2**: [8, 1]
- **Agent 3**: [0]
- **Agent 4**: [4]
- **Agent 5**: [5, 2]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, where possible, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8, 1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 2]
}
```
