Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  31  12  69  92  13  20  97  33
1  70  67  85  33  27  86  70   3   5
2  94  66  81  83  85  19  85   7  55
3  68  35  25  39  79  32  68  68  98
4   8   1  27  73  16  13  14  80  97
5  54  83  57  34  27  47  85  99  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 67 85 33 27 86 70  3  5]
 [94 66 81 83 85 19 85  7 55]

 [54 83 57 34 27 47 85 99 67]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that all 9 items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 0 at 98, which is the highest value for this item.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 5: Agent 5 values item 1 at 83, which is the highest value for this item.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 2 at 85, which is the highest value for this item.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2: Agent 2 values item 3 at 83, which is the highest value for this item.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 4 at 92, which is the highest value for this item.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 5 at 86, which is the highest value for this item.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 5: Agent 5 values item 6 at 85, which is the highest value for this item.
8. Assign item 7 to agent 4: Agent 4 values item 7 at 80, which is the highest value for this item.
9. Assign item 8 to agent 3: Agent 3 values item 8 at 98, which is the highest value for this item.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the total value received by each agent. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
