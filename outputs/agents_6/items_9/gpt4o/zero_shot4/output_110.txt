Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  69   2  85  14  32   1  52  12
1  49  74  17  60  77  39  39  40  65
2  37  25  85  60  48  93  89  46  49
3  75  21  32  84  59  27  13  75  85
4  55  28  37  54  26  97  27  26  44
5  96  27  87  64  37  33  91  33  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider an algorithm that attempts to distribute the items such that each agent gets items with high personal valuation. This approach will attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items. Given the table, we will try to assign items based on the highest values each agent has for the available items, while ensuring that each item is only assigned to one agent.

Let's go through the agents and items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (85) and 1 (69).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (77) and 1 (74).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 8 (85) and 3 (84).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (97).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (96) and 6 (91).

Let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (85) since it's highest for Agent 0 and also high for Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (97) since it's highest for Agent 4.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 5 (96) since it's highest for Agent 5.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (74) since it's high for Agent 1, and Agent 0 already has an item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (85) since it's high for Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (91) since it's high for Agent 5.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (77) since it's high for Agent 1.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (75) since it's high for Agent 3.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3 (85) since it's high for Agent 3.

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high valuation from their perspective while ensuring all items are allocated.
