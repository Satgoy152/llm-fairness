Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31   7  79   2  41  36  37  81  32
1  30  67  97  47  67  66  28  96  42
2  96  18  95   1  22  66  39   0  88
3  52  41  51  29  97  69  71  58  49
4   3  85  64   8  98  61  67  81   8
5  76  83  86  33  40   4  62  60  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a comparable total valuation. One common approach is to use a round-robin allocation method based on the highest valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value items are 7 (81), 2 (79), 6 (37)
- Agent 1: Highest value items are 2 (97), 7 (96), 1 (67)
- Agent 2: Highest value items are 0 (96), 2 (95), 8 (88)
- Agent 3: Highest value items are 4 (97), 6 (71), 5 (69)
- Agent 4: Highest value items are 4 (98), 1 (85), 6 (67)
- Agent 5: Highest value items are 8 (95), 2 (86), 1 (83)

By selecting items which have the highest value preference by a particular agent and ensuring that no item is selected more than once, we can achieve a fair allocation:

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 7
- Agent 1 gets item 2
- Agent 2 gets item 0
- Agent 3 gets item 4
- Agent 4 gets item 1
- Agent 5 gets item 8

Now, assign remaining items while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0 gets item 6
- Agent 3 gets item 5
- Agent 4 gets item 3

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (except agent 2 in this case, who receives just one due to high valuation), and the total number of items allocated is 9.
