Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  30  36  47  71  80  60  49  47
1  29  94  98  39  82  78  11  66  16
2  97  18  20  87  60  93  25  24  83
3  39  19  93  30  52   3   2  29  77
4  81   7  57  18  45  88   0  38  40
5  62  28  99  41  29  19   7  80  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives based on their preferences. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Sort the items by their highest valuation across all agents.** This will help decide which items are most valuable and who values them the most.
2. **Allocate items to agents who value them the highest, ensuring each agent gets as close to an equal share as possible.** This means ideally each agent gets one item, with some agents possibly getting one more.

Following this approach, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [6]
- Agent 1: Items [2]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 3: Items [8]
- Agent 4: Items [4]
- Agent 5: Items [3, 7]

To ensure fairness, each agent is given items that maximize their individual valuations while keeping the distribution fair.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 7]
}
```
