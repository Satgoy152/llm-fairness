Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  52  72  50  20  67  33  48  45
1  24  74  92  73  77  98  62  79  48
2  87  87  69  72  84  75  13  48  39
3  60  74  83  24  32  66   2   5  23
4  20  63  66  56  89  16  14  63  43
5  64  97  16  41  29  27  83  90  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations of items by each agent. A strategy could be to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's start by evaluating the highest value each agent places on an item and proceed to assign items based on maximum valuation, while ensuring no agent is left without any items unless necessary. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value (87) by agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value (97) by agent 5.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value (92) by agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value (73) by agent 1, but since agent 1 already has an item, allocate to next highest (72) by agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value (89) by agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value (98) by agent 1, but agent 1 already has an item, allocate to next highest (75) by agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value (83) by agent 5, but agent 5 already has an item, allocate to next highest (62) by agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value (90) by agent 5.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value (48) by agent 1, but agent 1 has already received two items, allocate to next highest (45) by agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
