Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89   7   7  82  43  66  81  75  21
1  29  18  44  77  59  50  88  34   7
2  61  16  50  56   2  21  28  80  61
3  25  84  74  44  15  36  19  23   4
4  42  36  19  13  45  22  53  46  24
5  53  40  80  84  72  20  61   0   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. One potential approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it most. This method doesn't guarantee an optimal solution in terms of fairness or envy-freeness but provides a straightforward allocation strategy.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0** is valued highest by Agent 0 (89).
2. **Item 1** is valued highest by Agent 3 (84).
3. **Item 2** is valued highest by Agent 5 (80).
4. **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 0 (82).
5. **Item 4** is valued highest by Agent 5 (72).
6. **Item 5** is valued highest by Agent 0 (66).
7. **Item 6** is valued highest by Agent 1 (88).
8. **Item 7** is valued highest by Agent 2 (80).
9. **Item 8** is valued highest by Agent 0 (21).

Now, we can distribute the items to the agents based on the above allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most while maintaining the constraint that all items are distributed.
