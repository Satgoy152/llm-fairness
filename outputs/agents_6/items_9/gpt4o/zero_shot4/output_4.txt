Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  61  55  23  47  71  38   9  96
1  15  90  75  75  54  18   2  26  30
2  65   9  14  45  15  49  19  86   0
3  55  68  66  16  43  78  40   0  16
4  87  92  15  79  49  78  30  17  37
5  62   1  50  21  39  38  78   8  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest value that each agent assigns to any item.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation for it, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 and item 8 highly, so we allocate items 0 and 8 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 and item 2 highly, so we allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 highly, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 5.
- This leaves item 3, which can be allocated to Agent 4, as they have a relatively high valuation for it compared to other agents who haven't been allocated many items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
