Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  56  37  76  13  93  55  11  89
1  92  19  50  46  11  59  53   8  16
2  59   2  24  61  76  99  65  63  16
3  43  68  41  98  99  99  53  13  94
4  16  52  52  99  84  78  72  10  89
5  36  25  33   8  65  25  41  50  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 6 agents, we can employ a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. However, a perfect distribution might not be possible since there are more agents than items. Let's try to ensure a fair distribution by considering each agent's highest-valued items.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 5 (highest value 93).
- Agent 1 receives item 0 (highest value 92).
- Agent 2 receives item 6 (highest value 65).
- Agent 3 receives item 3 (highest value 98).
- Agent 4 receives item 4 (highest value 84).
- Agent 5 receives item 8 (highest value 69).
- Agent 3 also receives item 7 (second highest value 13).
- Agent 4 also receives item 2 (second highest value 52).
- Agent 0 also receives item 1 (second highest value 56).

This allocation ensures that each agent except one receives at least one item and tries to distribute items based on highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4, 2],
    "5": [8]
}
```
