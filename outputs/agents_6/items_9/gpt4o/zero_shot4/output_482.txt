Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  47  65  23   4  59  72  24  40
1  15   6  69  55  28  73  76  69  47
2  43  58   3  16   2  77  47  21  64
3  13  48  24  24  54  79  47  10  39
4  83  30   2  98  61  17  10  47  86
5  68  13  20  30  65  48  70  96  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued item to each agent to ensure each agent gets at least one item.
2. Then allocate the remaining items to balance out the total valuation for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (Value: 88)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (Value: 76)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (Value: 77)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (Value: 54)
- Agent 4: Item 3 (Value: 98)
- Agent 5: Item 7 (Value: 96)

Now, we have allocated 6 items, leaving 3 items (1, 2, and 8) to be distributed fairly. 

- Allocate Item 1 (Agent 2, for balance: current 77, new 135)
- Allocate Item 2 (Agent 0, for balance: current 88, new 153)
- Allocate Item 8 (Agent 4, for balance: current 98, new 184)

This allocation considers both the initial high-value items for each agent and balances the additional items based on remaining valuations. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 8],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.
