Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81   7  57  56  42  92  85  11
1   3  91  80   3  86  66  32  49
2  79  65  21  69  86  64  73  23
3  39  93  32  40  91  98  48  84
4  45  69  39  27  58  47  39   9
5  30  71  42  27   3  26   2  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 91 80  3 86 66 32 49]
 [79 65 21 69 86 64 73 23]

 [30 71 42 27  3 26  2 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, I will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, except where this is not possible due to the limited number of items. 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 (value 92 for agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (value 91 for agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4 (value 86 for agent 2).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (value 40 for agent 3).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 (value 39 for agent 4).
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 7 (value 35 for agent 5).

This allocation covers 6 out of the 8 items, so we need to allocate the remaining 2 items:

7. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0 (value 81 for agent 0).
8. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 (value 48 for agent 3).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7]
}
```
