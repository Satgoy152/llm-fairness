Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42   3  52  54  12  33  85  51
1  20  54  84  77  15  33  58  70
2  57  72  84  77  28  20  10  49
3  59  53  27   7  77  44  39  91
4  24   8  71  84  35  46  93  60
5   0  89  88  59  87  31  77  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents might end up with more items, while others might have fewer or even none. We'll try to distribute the items fairly based on the given valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (highest value for item 6).
2. Assign item 7 to agent 3 (highest value for item 7).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 5 (highest value for item 1).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (highest value for item 2).
5. Assign item 0 to agent 3 (second-highest value for item 0).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (highest value for item 3).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (highest value for item 5).
8. Assign item 4 to agent 5 (highest value for item 4).

Now for the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, and it attempts to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations.
