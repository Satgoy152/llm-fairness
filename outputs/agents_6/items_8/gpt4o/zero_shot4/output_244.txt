Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  38  37  96  43  35  25  92
1  51  79  46  19  22  15  65  12
2   1  62  39  73  84  94  24  80
3  97  90  34  60  25  19  10  48
4  17  37  85  41  47  52  19  43
5  40  71  65  28  86  70  86  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated. We'll pursue a balanced approach to maximize overall satisfaction. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Begin by identifying the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest values, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Balance the number of items each agent receives while considering their valuations.

Given the constraints and the table provided, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 will get items that they value the most, such as item 3 (value 96) and item 7 (value 92).
- Agent 1 will receive item 1 (value 79) and item 6 (value 65).
- Agent 2 will receive item 5 (value 94).
- Agent 3 will receive item 0 (value 97).
- Agent 4 will receive item 2 (value 85).
- Agent 5 will receive item 4 (value 86).

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives items they value highly. Below is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```
