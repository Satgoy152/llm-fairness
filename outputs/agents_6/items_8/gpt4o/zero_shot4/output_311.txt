Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  41  28   4  69  62  20  79
1  77   3  46  46  43  61  31  82
2  93  77  24  35  64  59  73  65
3  43  47  87  49  87  48  11  80
4  30   8  48  31  52  17  30  20
5  21  90  76  60  56  93  93  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can follow a strategy where each agent receives items that maximize their utility or valuation. We will also ensure that all items are distributed and each agent receives as close to an equal number of items as possible.

Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive at least 1 item, with 2 agents receiving an additional item. We will prioritize based on the agents' valuations to ensure fairness.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. Assign the highest-valued items to the agents with the highest valuations for those items.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the number of items per agent.

Following this strategy, here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 93) and item 1 (value 90), as they have high valuations for these items.
2. Agent 3 gets item 2 (value 87) and item 4 (value 87).
3. Agent 1 gets item 7 (value 82).
4. Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 93).
5. Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 20).
6. Agent 4 gets item 3 (value 31).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed fairly based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5, 1]
}
```
