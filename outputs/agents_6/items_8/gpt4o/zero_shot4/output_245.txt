Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  87  79  88  37  31  37  13
1  23  73  91  50   5   6  34  34
2  45  32  13  53  87  24  74  40
3  45  19  55  97   6  52  75   4
4  75  12  53  20  97  88  71  48
5  53  12  88  89   4  26  85  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. We will try to allocate items such that each agent gets items that are of relatively high value to them, given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued item for each agent:** This can help in ensuring that each agent gets at least one item they value highly.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:** Start by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuation preferences, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

3. **Reallocate if necessary:** If there are conflicts (i.e., multiple agents have their highest value on the same item), prioritize based on the next highest value item available to each agent.

4. **Ensure all items are allocated:** Make sure all items are assigned, and each agent gets a fair share.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most, but since it's already taken, their next highest is item 6.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most, but since it's already taken, their next highest is item 5.
- Agent 5 values item 2 the most, but since it's already taken, their next highest is item 3, but that's also taken, so their next is item 6, which is also taken, so their next highest is item 7.

Allocating based on these observations, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 3, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.
- Agent 5 gets items 1, 3, and 7.

All 8 items are allocated, and every agent has at least one item.
