Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  93  61  19  29   3  41   1
1  46  61  55  37  94  13   2  25
2  43  77  37  75  56  86  64  32
3  85  98  64  92  71  53  40  97
4  91  24  63  51   1  79  35  16
5  29  51   4  29  57  58  24  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[17 93 61 19 29  3 41  1]
 [46 61 55 37 94 13  2 25]
 [43 77 37 75 56 86 64 32]
 [85 98 64 92 71 53 40 97]
 [91 24 63 51  1 79 35 16]
 [29 51  4 29 57 58 24 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1, Item 6
- Agent 1: Item 4, Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 5, Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: No items

This ensures that each agent receives items in a way that distributes the value as evenly as possible, given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": []
}
```
