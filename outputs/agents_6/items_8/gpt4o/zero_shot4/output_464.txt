Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  42   1  53  90  10  39  17
1  37   0  78  85  74  38  65  15
2  43  24  30  82  15  80  97  22
3  89  87  17  83  89  61  25  29
4  96   0  77  11  67  77  54  74
5  12  80  76  56   9  57  72  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37  0 78 85 74 38 65 15]

 [12 80 76 56  9 57 72 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. One potential approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one such allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value = 91).
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3 (values = 78, 85).
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (value = 97).
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (value = 87).
- Agent 4 gets items 4 and 7 (values = 67, 74).
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (value = 57).

Now let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a fair allocation based on their valuations.
