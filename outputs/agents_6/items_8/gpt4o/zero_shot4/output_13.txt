Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  73  11  17  53  17  42  13
1  44  28  67  45  55  59  25  36
2   0  46  56   2   2  17  99  89
3  80  78   1  39  52  29  96  57
4  18  21  98  24  51  25  89  78
5  17  71  46  37  79   4   5  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [17 71 46 37 79  4  5 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (as much as possible given the constraints).

Here is one such allocation strategy:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (valuation 73)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (valuation 67)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (valuation 99)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (valuation 80)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (valuation 78)
- Agent 5: Item 4 (valuation 79)

Now we have allocated 6 items, so we need to distribute the remaining 2 items. We can allocate them to agents with lower total valuations so far:

- Agent 5: Item 3 (valuation 37)
- Agent 0: Item 5 (valuation 17)

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed.
