Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67   9  91  22  21  77  98  97
1  50  37  97  39  19   0  76  56
2  76  70  58  61  68  63  84  83
3  58  98   5  99  41  96  27  27
4  23  94  22  84  95  80  33  77
5  63  20   2  11  76  87  32  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 6 agents, we will try to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's value for the items they receive while ensuring all items are allocated. Given the constraints, here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest valuations by each agent and try to allocate those items to them.
2. Ensure each item is assigned to only one agent.
3. Distribute items such that all 8 items are allocated.

Following this approach, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 6 and 7.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 2 can take item 0.
- Agent 3 has high value for item 3.
- Agent 4 can take item 4.
- Agent 5 can take items 1 and 5.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and tries to respect the agents' preferences based on their valuations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
