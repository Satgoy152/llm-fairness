Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  28  84  26  48  25  33  63
1  67  80  11  47  71   1  77  71
2  94  59  12  58  36  40  15   1
3  40  41  61  18  61  21  86  73
4  19  88  83  71  87  88  26   1
5  81  72  95  22  94  20   2  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of their received items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. First, we'll identify items that each agent values highly and then try to distribute them accordingly.

Let's make the allocations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 6.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 6 and 7.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
6. Agent 5 has high valuations for items 2 and 4.

Considering these preferences and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, here is one way to allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 95), item 2 to Agent 5 (value 95)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 80), item 6 to Agent 3 (value 86)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 58), item 7 to Agent 3 (value 73)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value 87), item 5 to Agent 0 (value 25)

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
