Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  34  85  76   3  55   3  11
1  44  52  23   9  81  17  11  41
2  91  22  22  67  21  13  32  86
3  87  84  43   7  37  27  31  56
4  43  12  72  18  82  68   0  73
5  99  30   1  60  91  76  83  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed without any overlapping. We will prioritize allocations based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items, ensuring that allocations are fairly distributed.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Evaluate the highest valuation for each agent and try to assign the items based on their preferences.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a fair share, considering the total number of items is 8.

### Allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (85), so we assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (81), so we assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (91), so we assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most, but it has been taken, so we assign the next highest valued item, item 1 (84), to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most, but it has been taken, so we assign the next highest valued item, item 5 (68), to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most, but it has been taken, so we assign the next highest valued item, item 0 (99), to agent 5.

Remaining items are 3, 6, and 7. We distribute these based on remaining valuations:

- Agent 0: Assign item 3 (76) to agent 0.
- Agent 2: Assign item 7 (86) to agent 2.
- Agent 5: Assign item 6 (83) to agent 5.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item based on their valuations.
