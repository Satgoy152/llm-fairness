Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87   3  55  26  69  74   3  28
1   8  71  77  92  17   9   8  26
2  69   8  84  62   3  88   6  37
3  33  76  58  38  37  63  69  71
4  80  32  21  97  44   9  51  85
5  37  77  96  71  16  82  24  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. We need to allocate exactly 8 items to the 6 agents.

Let's consider the valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 0 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 3 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 5 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 7 (71).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 3 (97), but since item 3 is already allocated, next highest is item 7 (85). But item 7 is allocated, so we go for item 0 (80).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 2 (96).

Now we need to ensure all 8 items are distributed:

- Items 1, 4, and 6 are yet to be allocated.

Let's allocate them to agents who would benefit the most based on remaining highest valuations:

- **Item 1**: Agent 5 has a high value for item 1 (77).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 has a high value for item 4 (69).
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 has a high value for item 6 (69).

The final allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
