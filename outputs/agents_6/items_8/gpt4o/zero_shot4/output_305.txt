Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  54  59  34  37  44  62  98
1   9  67  87  30  47  53  34  95
2  92  50  72  42  95  24  93  67
3  20  27  47  31  87  53  79  86
4  93  85  76   3  63  56  76  30
5  75  19  67  14  37  72   2  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I'll use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that every item is allocated, while considering the preferences expressed in the valuation matrix.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with higher values like 0, 6, and 7 (64, 62, and 98).
2. **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 5 (87 and 53).
3. **Agent 2**: Items 4 (95).
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 (31).
5. **Agent 4**: Item 1 (85).
6. **Agent 5**: No items allocated.

After considering the above allocations, here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated to the agents.
