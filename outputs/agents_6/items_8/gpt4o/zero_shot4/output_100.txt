Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  84  29  37  96  84  24  16
1  33  72  10  81  33  30  38  88
2  53  23  28  80  48  81  63   9
3  39  40   4  29  76  14  83  87
4  97  15  85  42  39  38  14  70
5  64  62  95  49  49  95   6  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [97 15 85 42 39 38 14 70]
 [64 62 95 49 49 95  6 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we aim to maximize the overall valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and only 8 items in total are assigned.

Below is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 highly (96).
2. Agent 1 values item 7 highly (88).
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly (81).
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly (83).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 highly (97).
6. Agent 5 values item 2 highly (95).
7. Agent 5 can also receive item 3 (49), since it maintains a high value.
8. Agent 4 can also receive item 1 (15) to balance the allocation.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents with the consideration of maximizing their individual valuations.
