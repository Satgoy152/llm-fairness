Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  27   0  92  96  72   7  28
1   9  38  22  14  45  16  81  72
2  83  87  22  64  35  24  13  88
3  14  61   4   2  19  39  97  97
4  19  43  61  96  77  99   7  86
5  37  86   3  69  65  88  12  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, and some may receive none.

Let's approach this by assigning items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest at 96.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the highest at 81.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 7 the highest at 88.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the highest at 97. However, this item is already taken by Agent 1, so we proceed to the next highest valued item, which is 7, also valued at 97.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 the highest at 99.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 5 the highest at 88, but this item is already taken by Agent 4, so we assign the next highest valued available item, which is 1, valued at 86.

Let's summarize the allocations so far:
- Item 4 is allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 6 is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 7 is allocated to Agent 3.
- Item 5 is allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 1 is allocated to Agent 5.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 2, and 3.

7. **Remaining allocations**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2, who values it at 83.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4, who values it at 61.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, who values it at 92.

Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
