Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  92  33  75  17   8  65   8
1  39  76  97  92  36  15  39  97
2  16  64  37   0  12  53  65  71
3  38  99  18   4  60   8  72  35
4  14  71  80  68  61  78  42   7
5  69  58   8   6  78  61   9  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the six agents, we can try to prioritize giving each agent the item they value most until all items are allocated. This approach aims to maximize overall satisfaction or valuation for the items each agent receives. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 1 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (97).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 7 (71).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 1 (99), but it is already taken, so we move to item 6 (72).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 5 (78).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation is for item 4 (78).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items. Since each agent has already received their item with the highest valuation, we consider the next highest available:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest available is item 3 (75).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest available is item 7 (97), but it is already taken, so we choose item 3 (92), but it is already taken, so we choose item 0 (39).
- **Agent 2**: Already has received an item.
- **Agent 3**: Already has received an item.
- **Agent 4**: Already has received an item.
- **Agent 5**: Already has received an item.

Now we have:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated items 1, 3.
- **Agent 1**: Allocated items 2, 0.
- **Agent 2**: Allocated item 7.
- **Agent 3**: Allocated item 6.
- **Agent 4**: Allocated item 5.
- **Agent 5**: Allocated item 4.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
