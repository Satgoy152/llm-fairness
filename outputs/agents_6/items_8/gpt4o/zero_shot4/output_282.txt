Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  88  45  25  46  38   4  75
1  82  99   8  74  74  61  63  14
2  35  96  92  88   2  64  27  90
3  61  18   7  13   4  29  45  63
4  14  32   7  28  23  13  30  59
5  95  89  52  99  82  47  91  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we can use a method like the "maximum valuation" approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. We will also need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, or as fair a distribution as possible.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate accordingly:

1. For each item, assign it to the agent with the highest valuation.

2. If an agent has been assigned no items, we can reallocate one item from the agent with the most items, preferably choosing an item they value the least.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (99)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (92)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (99)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (82)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (64)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (91)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (90)

Now, let's see how many items each agent has been assigned:
- Agent 0: 1 item
- Agent 1: 1 item
- Agent 2: 3 items
- Agent 3: 0 items
- Agent 4: 0 items
- Agent 5: 3 items

Since Agent 3 and Agent 4 have no items, we need to reallocate:

- Reallocate Item 3 from Agent 5 to Agent 3 (Agent 5 values Item 3 the least among their items).
- Reallocate Item 4 from Agent 5 to Agent 4 (Agent 5 has a lower valuation for Item 4 compared to other items).

After reallocation, the distribution is:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5, 7
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 6

This gives each agent at least one item, with a total of 8 items allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
