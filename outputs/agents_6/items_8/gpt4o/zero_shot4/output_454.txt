Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  31  70  13   3  43  18  78
1  53  96  12  89  99  28  45  84
2  16  35  63  25  82  81  43  72
3  66  94  72  30  94   8  75  15
4  47  66  81  66  55   4  34  45
5  24  36  18  16  70  79  66   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we want to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will end up with more items than others, but we'll ensure no agent is left without an item.

Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute items so that each agent gets the highest valued items possible, maintaining fairness and efficiency:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent should ideally get items with high valuations. The maximum valuations for agent 0 are items 0, 2, and 7. Let's allocate item 0 (value 70) to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the most, with a valuation of 99. We'll allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5 at 81. Assign item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for this agent is for items 1 and 4. Since item 4 is taken, we'll assign item 1 (value 94) to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 2 highly at 81. We'll allocate item 2 to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 5 at 79, which is already allocated. The next highest valued item is 6 with a valuation of 66. Assign item 6 to agent 5.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items (3 and 7) to ensure fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 0.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 4.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 5.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 2.
- **Agent 5**: Already has item 6.

For the remaining items:

- Item 3: Allocate to agent 1, who has only one item and values item 3 at 89.
- Item 7: Allocate to agent 0, who values item 7 at 78.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6]
}
```
