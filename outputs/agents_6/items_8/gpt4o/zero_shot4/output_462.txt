Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  17  64   8  60  24  54  39
1  53  77   3  18  50  23  77  45
2  70  36   7  87  48  30  83  92
3  24  24  66  22  72   6  39  25
4  31  19  53  73  90  22  94  37
5  85  79  76  52  38  39  17  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a simple heuristic by considering the highest valuations for each item and assigning the item to the agent who values it the most. This method may not be perfect, but it attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 85 by agent 5.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 79 by agent 5.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 76 by agent 5.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 87 by agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 90 by agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 39 by agent 5.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 94 by agent 4.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 92 by agent 2.

Notice that agent 5 has been allocated more items than others, so let's rebalance to ensure each agent gets an item (or as evenly distributed as possible):

- **Item 0**: Allocate to agent 5
- **Item 1**: Allocate to agent 5
- **Item 2**: Allocate to agent 3 (next highest 66)
- **Item 3**: Allocate to agent 2
- **Item 4**: Allocate to agent 4
- **Item 5**: Allocate to agent 0 (next highest 24)
- **Item 6**: Allocate to agent 4
- **Item 7**: Allocate to agent 2

Now, let's distribute the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```
