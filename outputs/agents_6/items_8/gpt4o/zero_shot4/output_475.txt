Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  54  85  66  94  51   4  24
1  85  58   2  69   9  76   3  67
2  17   9  72  96  75  17   2  62
3  61  57  45  68  77  24  19  45
4  76  63  75  36   9  30  57  70
5  87  94  10  51  78  44  70   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will get more than one item, while others might get just one.

Given the constraints and the goal to maximize the total valuation for each agent, a possible allocation could be as follows:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent and each agent gets at least one item.

2. Attempt to distribute items to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent, considering their valuations.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 2, maximizing their high valuations for those items.
- Agent 1 receives item 0, which has a high valuation for them.
- Agent 2 receives item 3, which they value highly.
- Agent 3 receives item 1, which is among their higher valuations.
- Agent 4 receives item 7, which they value relatively well.
- Agent 5 receives items 5 and 6, which are among their higher valuations.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
