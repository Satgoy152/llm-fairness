Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  29  17  77  90  87  36  66
1   0  68  35  29  93  81   9  99
2  77  97  39   9  91  46  30  57
3  29  95  96  92  15  91  27  59
4  24  41  58  30  88  67  36  61
5  35  92  64  27   9  43   9  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we will attempt to distribute the items based on maximizing the agents' valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Considering there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

A possible allocation strategy is to examine the highest valuation each agent has for specific items and allocate those items accordingly. This can be refined by ensuring all items are allocated and considering other close valuations to balance the distribution.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 4 and 6
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Items 0 and 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item that they value relatively highly, and all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```
