Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  65  49  68  14  67  29   1
1  41  22  77  82  41  72  74  69
2  41  98  49  28  57  54  20  57
3  32  96  25  97  10  33  25  72
4  55  91   5  50  57  30  42   5
5  97  13  56  42  97  78  55  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate 8 items among 6 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We will aim to distribute these items fairly, considering the valuations each agent has for the items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Consider the highest valuation for each item and attempt to allocate that item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. If there's a tie in valuation or if an agent already has enough items, consider the next highest valuation or redistribute accordingly.

Following this strategy:

- Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 77.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 97.
- Item 4: Agent 0 and Agent 5 both value it highly at 97. Since Agent 5 already has item 0, allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 72, which is the highest remaining unique valuation.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 74, which is the highest remaining unique valuation.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it at 72, which is the highest available unique valuation.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an item if possible and that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all 8 items are allocated, and the allocation is done based on maximizing each agent's valuation for at least some of the items they receive.
