Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  35  18  53  70  77   4  92
1  97  47  76  36  73  23  20  32
2  38  69  86  50  72  63  80   9
3  67  25  39  14   5  89  52  73
4  47  52  64  60  51  40  89  67
5  79  60  42  38  80  16   1  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [79 60 42 38 80 16  1 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. We aim to maximize the total valuation received by all agents.

Hereâ€™s a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 7 the most at 92.
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 0 the most at 97.
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 2 the most at 86.
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 5 the most at 89.
5. **Agent 4**: They value item 6 the most at 89.
6. **Agent 5**: They value item 4 the most at 80.

After allocating these items, we have one item left, item 3. The remaining agents who don't have this item have the following valuations for it:
- Agent 0: 53
- Agent 1: 36
- Agent 2: 50
- Agent 3: 14
- Agent 4: 60
- Agent 5: 38

Agent 4 values item 3 the most among the unallocated agents, so we allocate item 3 to them.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
