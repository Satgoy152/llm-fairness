Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  82   7  47  79  85  90  97
1  19  99   0  66  23  85  10  15
2  71  76  59   9  23  38  99  94
3  57  36  27  51  47  79  47  51
4  65  60  94  50  96  78  47  61
5  38  90  45  56  18  41   5  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use a method that approximates maximizing the total sum of valuations for each agent. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they received each item.
2. Assign items to agents such that the total valuation for all agents is maximized, keeping in mind that each agent should get at least one item if possible.

Based on the provided valuations:

| Agent | Valuations (for items 0 to 7)         |
|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 0     | [18, 82, 7, 47, 79, 85, 90, 97]      |
| 1     | [19, 99, 0, 66, 23, 85, 10, 15]      |
| 2     | [71, 76, 59, 9, 23, 38, 99, 94]      |
| 3     | [57, 36, 27, 51, 47, 79, 47, 51]     |
| 4     | [65, 60, 94, 50, 96, 78, 47, 61]     |
| 5     | [38, 90, 45, 56, 18, 41, 5, 23]      |

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets item 7 (highest valuation: 97)
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (highest valuation: 99)
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (highest valuation: 99)
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (highest valuation: 79)
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (highest valuation: 96)
- Agent 5 gets item 3 (highest valuation: 56)
- Agent 0 gets item 5 (second highest valuation after 7)
- Agent 4 gets item 2 (second highest valuation after 4)

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 2],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. Note that each agent receives at least one item as requested.
