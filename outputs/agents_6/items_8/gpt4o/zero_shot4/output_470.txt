Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  27  31  62   1  52  30  14
1  84  12  89  78  26  14  32  93
2  81   8  45  43  35  25  55   9
3  21  95  77  47  80  58  46  86
4  51  44  72  54  42  60  16   6
5  56  89  29  87  94  86  29   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items with only and precisely 8 items being allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, who values it highly.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3, who values it the most.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, who values it the most.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 5, who values it the most.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 5, who values it highly.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5, who values it highly.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2, who values it the most.
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1, who values it the most.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an appropriate number of items based on their valuations, and all items are distributed. Here's the distribution in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
