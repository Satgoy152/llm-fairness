Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  93  36  15  99  39  81  17
1  29  56  71   6  49  41  97  21
2   4  35  62  58  14  82  10  55
3  77  28  97  96  49  62  77  89
4  94  49  27  23  46  17  51  62
5  99  99  92  96  98  99  48  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [99 99 92 96 98 99 48 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can use a simple greedy approach where each agent is given the item that they value the most, provided it hasn't been allocated yet. Given that there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 5 values items 0, 1, 3, and 5 highly (99 each). We can give one of these to agent 5. Let's give item 1 to agent 5.
2. Agent 0 values item 4 highly (99). Give item 4 to agent 0.
3. Agent 3 values item 2 highly (97). Give item 2 to agent 3.
4. Agent 1 values item 6 highly (97). Give item 6 to agent 1.
5. Agent 2 values item 5 highly (82). Give item 5 to agent 2.
6. Agent 4 values item 0 highly (94). Give item 0 to agent 4.
7. Now, we have items 3 and 7 left. Agent 3 also values item 3 highly (96). Give item 3 to agent 3.
8. Finally, Agent 4 can take item 7 as it's the last remaining item.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [0, 7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their highest-valued available item, given that not all items can be assigned to all agents.
