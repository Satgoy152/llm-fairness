Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  21  13  22  45  26  44  15
1  93  25  36  98  81  36  59   6
2   1  89  47  13  73  95  90  34
3  19  43  83  18  82   0  49   6
4  79  44  22  75  45  90  41  78
5  62  60  21   5  55  52   6  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are assigned. We will aim to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 4 (value 45).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 3 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 5 (value 95).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 2 (value 83).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 5, but since it's taken, we choose item 7 (value 78).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation for item 7, but since it's taken, we choose item 0 (value 62).

Now, we must ensure all items are allocated:

- Items allocated so far: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.

Remaining items: 1, 6. Let's allocate them to maximize remaining satisfaction:

- **Agent 2**: Second highest valuation for item 6 (value 90).
- **Agent 3**: Second highest valuation for item 1 (value 43).

Now, each item has been allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0]
}
```
