Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  88  57  93  79   7  88  21
1  94  25  41  83   1  38  31  70
2   4  54  94  96   3  59  37  37
3  42  83  94  79  32  98  68   2
4  58  95  33  99  83  77  56  79
5  16  47  79  27  82  89   6  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and find a distribution that maximizes the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 1.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 5.

After considering the valuations, the allocations could be as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Items 4, 7
- Agent 5: Item 6

These allocations give each agent a fair distribution based on their preferences and ensure that all items are allocated.

Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
```
