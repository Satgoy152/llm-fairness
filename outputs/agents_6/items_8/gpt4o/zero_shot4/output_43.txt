Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  48  71  21  51  83  29  16
1  22  23  55  18  45  79   2  57
2  19   2  59  40  22  85  64  79
3  71  67  81  79  57  15   7  68
4  45  22  76  87  78  20   8  73
5  21  46   2   9  86  73  95  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can aim to distribute the items based on the highest valuations to ensure each agent gets items they value the most. This is one approach to fairness, often called "maximizing total utility," where we try to maximize the sum of the values that agents assign to the items they receive.

First, let's identify the highest valuations for each item across the agents:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 71.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 67.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 81.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 87.
- Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 85.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most at 95.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 79.

Now, we allocate the items based on these highest valuations:

1. Agent 3: Items 0, 1, 2
2. Agent 4: Item 3
3. Agent 5: Items 4, 6
4. Agent 2: Items 5, 7

This allocation assigns items to agents in a way that each agent's highest valued items are considered. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 1, 2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This ensures all 8 items are allocated, and the allocation aligns with the highest valuations from the given table.
