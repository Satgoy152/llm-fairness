Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  79  48  22  11  40  54  80
1  97  57   7  99  46  91  34  39
2  55  10  86   4  62  83  49   8
3  58  51  76  87   6  29  54  29
4  29  89  11  33  38  26  71  31
5  28  80  21  98  28  69   5  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed. One way to approach this is by looking at the valuations of each agent for each item and attempting to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while also ensuring that each item is allocated only once.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for an item, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 2.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 1.
6. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 7.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (4 and 6) to the agents:

- Item 4: Assign it to Agent 2, who has a relatively high valuation for it.
- Item 6: Assign it to Agent 0, who has a fair valuation for it.

The allocations would then be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed and each agent receives items based on their valuations.
