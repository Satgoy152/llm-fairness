Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  36  82  61  66  59  41  20
1  70   5  73  14  96   7  32  82
2  62  20  17  89  42  93  67  90
3  60   2  76  91  16  72  62   9
4  32  18  36   3  43  64  29  83
5  27  76  60  67  34  26  25   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to distribute the 8 items among the 6 agents so that the total valuation for each agent is reasonably balanced, given that each agent can receive an integer number of items.

One approach to achieve fairness is by maximizing the minimum satisfaction or balancing the allocation by focusing on the agents' highest value items first. Here's a possible allocation that tries to balance the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Let's give them item 2 as they value it the highest at 82.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 to them, which they value at 96.
- **Agent 2**: Give them item 5, which they value at 93.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 to them, which they value at 91.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 7, which they value at 83.
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 1, which they value at 76.
- **Remaining Items**: Items 0 and 6 need to be assigned to balance the allocations.

- **Agent 0**: They can also take item 0, valued at 69, to balance their allocation.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 to them, valued at 67, as it helps balance their total value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items and attempts to provide each agent with items they value highly, balancing the total value received by each agent.
