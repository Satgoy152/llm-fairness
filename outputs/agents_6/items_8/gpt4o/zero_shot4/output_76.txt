Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  70  87  80  58  38  35  46
1  98  31  27  92  73  47   5  94
2  50  52  90  99  38   2  44  55
3  65  10  48   1  76  95  38   1
4  89  98  88  56  57  60  45  46
5  98  91  98  74  53  92  17  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent has a fair share based on their preferences. We can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives by allocating the items they value the most. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (87).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (92).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (99), but since item 3 is already taken, we can allocate item 2 (90).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most (95).
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most (98).
6. Agent 5 values item 0 and 2 the most (98), but since item 2 is already taken, we can allocate item 0 (98).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can receive item 6, which they value next highest (35).
- Agent 1 can receive item 7, which they value next highest (94).
- Agent 2 can receive item 4, which they value next highest (38).

Now, let's verify that each agent has received at least one item, ensuring fairness and maximizing their valuations as much as possible within the constraints:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items is 8. It attempts to distribute the items in a way that considers the highest values each agent has for the available items.
