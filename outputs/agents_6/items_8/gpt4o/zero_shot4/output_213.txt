Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  78  80  79  37  38  97  13
1  34  65  15  50  36  58  84  84
2  63  48  11  57  61  74  95   2
3  74  27  51  98  16  57  76  76
4  68  58  48  27  62  22  57   7
5  16   4  58  79  30  54  48   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [16  4 58 79 30 54 48  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple method where each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the total value based on the agents' preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign Item 4 to Agent 4 who values it highly (62).
2. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 who values it highly (74).
3. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 who values it highly (97).
4. Assign Item 7 to Agent 1 who values it highly (84).
5. Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 who values it highly (98).
6. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 who values it highly (78).
7. Assign Item 0 to Agent 5 who values it highest (16).
8. Assign Item 2 to Agent 5 who values it highly (58).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and we distribute the items based on their valuations to maximize their satisfaction. The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents.
