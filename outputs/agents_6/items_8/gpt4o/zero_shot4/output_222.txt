Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  11   8  25  37  82  65  14
1  41  69  56  42  51  64  63   9
2  31  47   1  39  49  96  47  27
3  93  39   3  58  10  12  42  86
4  77  45  98  53  23  86   2  68
5  15  21  78  96   8   5  10  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

One way to approach this is by using a simple greedy algorithm where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (93).
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (69).
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (98).
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (96).
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (51).
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (96).
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (65).
8. Item 7: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (86).

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0, 7]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [3]

Thus, the complete allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
