Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  66  16   1  35  93  53  57
1  70  30   6   7   6  46  78  47
2   1   6   3   8  71  86  64  28
3  40  50  86  49  74   5  36  41
4  21  52  84   8  89  71  80  60
5  39  85  43  30  93  75  84  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent places on the items and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable total value. One way to approach this is by attempting to maximize the minimum value each agent receives or by distributing the items to balance the total valuations as much as possible.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuation for item 1 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has high valuation for item 0 and 6.
3. Agent 2 has high valuation for item 4 and 5.
4. Agent 3 has high valuation for item 2.
5. Agent 4 has high valuation for item 4.
6. Agent 5 has high valuation for item 1 and 4.

Let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 is one of the lowest after initial allocation).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 is also one of the lowest after initial allocation).

By doing this, we attempt to balance the value distribution across agents as fairly as possible.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```
