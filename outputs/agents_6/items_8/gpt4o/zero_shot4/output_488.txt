Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  78  55  91  89  21  40  13
1  43  61  66   2  69  45  41  79
2  85  67  14  72  32  24  63  32
3   9  78  67  38   9  25  93  98
4  73   4  67  91  52  83  11  67
5  16  92  25  58  43  16  70  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated. 

1. We can start by assigning each agent their highest valued item.
2. Once each agent has at least one item, we can allocate the remaining items based on the next highest available valuations, ensuring that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (91).
- Agent 1 values item 7 (79) the most.
- Agent 2 values item 0 (85) the most.
- Agent 3 values item 7 (98) but since it’s already taken, we assign item 6 (93).
- Agent 4 values item 3 (91), but since it’s already taken, we assign item 5 (83).
- Agent 5 values item 1 (92) the most.

After ensuring each agent receives at least one item, we allocate the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations:

- Item 4 is assigned to Agent 1 (69).
- Item 2 is assigned to Agent 3 (67).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to satisfy each agent with a high-value item.
