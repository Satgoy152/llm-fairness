Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  99  26  21  97  22  36   9
1  33  48  47  15  95   7   7   6
2  55  98  62  59  28  48  13  47
3  66  35  94  18   6  84  15  85
4  85   3  93  59  54  92  25   1
5  82  12  88  56  99  42  61  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we will consider each agent's valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations - [18, 99, 26, 21, 97, 22, 36, 9]
   - Highest value items: 1 (99), 4 (97)
   - Allocate items [1, 4]

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations - [33, 48, 47, 15, 95, 7, 7, 6]
   - Highest value items: 4 (95), 2 (47)
   - Allocate items [2]

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations - [55, 98, 62, 59, 28, 48, 13, 47]
   - Highest value items: 1 (98), 2 (62)
   - Allocate items [5]

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations - [66, 35, 94, 18, 6, 84, 15, 85]
   - Highest value items: 2 (94), 7 (85)
   - Allocate items [2, 7]

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations - [85, 3, 93, 59, 54, 92, 25, 1]
   - Highest value items: 0 (85), 2 (93)
   - Allocate items [0]

6. **Agent 5**: Valuations - [82, 12, 88, 56, 99, 42, 61, 24]
   - Highest value items: 4 (99), 2 (88)
   - Allocate items [3, 6]

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [3, 6]

This allocation uses all 8 items with each agent receiving at least one item. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```
