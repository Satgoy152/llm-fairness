Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  80  87  23  50  46  10  18
1   6  54   1  89  57   1  10  52
2   3  21  51   8  89  43  73   9
3  52  20  56   3   4  25  43  32
4  21  22  59  40  53  46  84  14
5  50  53  82  37  73  24   9  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation for each item. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most with 69.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most with 80.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with 87.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most with 89.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with 89.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with 46.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most with 84.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most with 52.

Now we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 7
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: No items

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```
