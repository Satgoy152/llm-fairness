Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  91  56  88  91  71  58   6
1  31  86   3  72  38   4  85  50
2  23  71  53  36  62  47  50  44
3  57  59  21  69  27  77  20  65
4   4  31  55  97  46  92  23  35
5  97   6  30   1  50  63  27  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 86  3 72 38  4 85 50]
 [23 71 53 36 62 47 50 44]

 [ 4 31 55 97 46 92 23 35]
 [97  6 30  1 50 63 27 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and we'll try to maximize the total valuations for the agents. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly at 91, which is the highest value for that item. Let's assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 highly at 85, which is the highest value for that item. Let's assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly at 53, which is the highest value for that item. Let's assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 highly at 77, which is the highest value for that item. Let's assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly at 97, which is the highest value for that item. Let's assign item 3 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 highly at 97, which is the highest value for that item. Let's assign item 0 to agent 5.
7. Assign the remaining items 4 and 7 to the agents with the highest remaining valuations:

   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 91, which is the highest remaining value. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 3 values it at 65, which is the highest remaining value. Assign item 7 to agent 3.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
