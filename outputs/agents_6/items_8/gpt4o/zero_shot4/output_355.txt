Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  14  14  78  65  60   7  68
1  55   4  95  80  17  96   4   6
2  36  93  22  41  74  90  22  92
3  22  73  66  68  68  70  25  68
4  35  83   1  50   6  20  81   0
5  85  52  80  46  43  32  17  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least some consideration, assuming we can't leave any agent with zero items unless absolutely necessary due to the number of items versus agents. Given that there are more agents than the items, some agents will inevitably not receive any items.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 5
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 7
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: No items

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuations across all items, ensuring that those items are given to agents who value them most. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```

This plan ensures all items are allocated effectively, maximizing the overall utility while distributing the items fairly under the constraints.
