Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  63  36  58  41  10  26  10
1  23  83  76   5  98  18  97  88
2  13  18  27  10  80  61  59  48
3  12  18  16  15  84  79   8  31
4  79  57  93  96   7  96  82  26
5  86  99  77  23  85   0  36  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item. 

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items to maximize fairness and total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item is item 0 with a value of 90.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item is item 4 with a value of 98.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item is item 4 with a value of 80, but it's already allocated.
   - Second highest value item is item 5 with a value of 61.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item is item 4 with a value of 84, but it's already allocated.
   - Second highest value item is item 5 with a value of 79, but it's already allocated.
   - Next best option is item 7 with a value of 31.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value item is item 3 with a value of 96.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest value item is item 1 with a value of 99.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 5.

Now, two items remain: items 2 and 6. We will allocate them to agents who would benefit most, ensuring no agent is left without an item.

7. **Allocating Remaining Items**:
   - Item 2 has the highest remaining value for Agent 4 with a value of 93.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 4.
   - Item 6 has the highest remaining value for Agent 1 with a value of 97.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 1.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
