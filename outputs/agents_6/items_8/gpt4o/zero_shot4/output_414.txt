Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  30  58  50  14  90  86   4
1  38  52  70   0  67   3  88  93
2  94  69  62  85  91  44  61   9
3  13  73  47  24  83  27  12   4
4  45  53  16  59  25  95  76  18
5  72  25   2  73  18  45  13  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of all agents. One approach is to use a method like the "greedy allocation" where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item while distributing all items.

Let's analyze and allocate:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it highest:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 96 (highest)
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 73 (highest)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 70 (highest)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 85 (highest)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 91 (highest)
   - Item 5: Agent 4 values it at 95 (highest)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 88 (highest)
   - Item 7: Agent 5 values it at 97 (highest)

2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated:
   - Agent 0: Item 0
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 6
   - Agent 2: Items 3, 4
   - Agent 3: Item 1
   - Agent 4: Item 5
   - Agent 5: Item 7

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7]
}
```
