Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8   2  84  99  69  52  55  16
1  79   3  73  74  88   3  55  76
2  51  29  50   2  73  20  31  75
3  42  91  25  30  30  20  70  74
4  45  70  47  82  17  40  76  83
5  95  79  29  42   2  78  48  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [45 70 47 82 17 40 76 83]
 [95 79 29 42  2 78 48 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. One approach is to analyze the valuations to make sure the distribution is as balanced as possible. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 7.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 6.
- Agent 5 gets item 5.

This allocation considers the highest value each agent has for particular items, while also ensuring that every item is assigned.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```
