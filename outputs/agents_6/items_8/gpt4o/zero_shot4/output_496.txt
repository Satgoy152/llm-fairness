Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  38  13  96  98  45  47  14
1  69  61  74  85  27  52   5  51
2  35  39  96  83  64  76   7  62
3  53  39  64  52  38  92  38  61
4  80  12  85  83  68   2  97  57
5  58   1  45   6  36  53  15  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their individual valuations. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents may not receive any items.

Let's allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Valuations are [44, 69, 35, 53, 80, 58]. Agent 4 values it the most.
2. **Item 1**: Valuations are [38, 61, 39, 39, 12, 1]. Agent 1 values it the most.
3. **Item 2**: Valuations are [13, 74, 96, 64, 85, 45]. Agent 2 values it the most.
4. **Item 3**: Valuations are [96, 85, 83, 52, 83, 6]. Agent 0 values it the most.
5. **Item 4**: Valuations are [98, 27, 64, 38, 68, 36]. Agent 0 values it the most.
6. **Item 5**: Valuations are [45, 52, 76, 92, 2, 53]. Agent 3 values it the most.
7. **Item 6**: Valuations are [47, 5, 7, 38, 97, 15]. Agent 4 values it the most.
8. **Item 7**: Valuations are [14, 51, 62, 61, 57, 53]. Agent 2 values it the most.

Based on the allocations above, each agent receives the following items:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 3: Item [5]
- Agent 4: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 5: No items

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": []
}
```
