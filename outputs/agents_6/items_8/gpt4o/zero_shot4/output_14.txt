Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  71  53  56  17  68  39  91
1  35  72  76  13  66  22  89  93
2  84  18  27   4  79  66  19  99
3  48  66  33  50  33  32   3  78
4  51  13  12  94  72  96  86  40
5  95  83  31  57  76   3  99  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 72 76 13 66 22 89 93]
 [84 18 27  4 79 66 19 99]

 [51 13 12 94 72 96 86 40]
 [95 83 31 57 76  3 99 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we can use a simple approach of assigning items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the unallocated items. This approach ensures that each agent receives items they value the most, promoting fairness.

Here is the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 5** values item 0 at 95, which is the highest for any item. Hence, item 0 is allocated to Agent 5.
2. **Agent 1** values item 7 at 93, which is the next highest. Hence, item 7 is allocated to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 at 99, but since it's already allocated, the next highest is item 4 with a valuation of 79. Hence, item 4 is allocated to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 4** values item 5 at 96, which is the highest for any remaining item. Hence, item 5 is allocated to Agent 4.
5. **Agent 5** values item 6 at 99, which is the highest for any remaining item. Hence, item 6 is allocated to Agent 5.
6. **Agent 0** values item 7 at 91, but since it's already allocated, the next highest is item 1 with a valuation of 71. Hence, item 1 is allocated to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1** now values item 2 at 76, which is the highest valuation for any remaining item. Hence, item 2 is allocated to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 3** values item 3 at 50, which is the highest for any remaining item. Hence, item 3 is allocated to Agent 3.

Now, we have allocated 8 items in total, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```
