Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  48  10  35  47  41  86  23
1  72  37  36  12  62   0  73  89
2  77  48  85  34   0  80  32  97
3  54  79  84  96  15  63  55  43
4  65  17  66  75  43   3  96   9
5  88  29  55   3  91  59  61  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets items that maximize their total value while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Based on the given table, here is one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values item 6.
- Agent 1 highly values item 7.
- Agent 2 highly values item 7, but since Agent 1 has a higher unique value for it, we'll consider another item for Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 6, but since Agent 0 has a higher unique value for it, we'll consider another item for Agent 4.
- Agent 5 highly values item 0.

We'll assign items based on the highest valuations that haven't been assigned yet:

- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 7.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets items 0 and 5.
  
Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```
