Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  76  73  39  69  96  96  44
1  40  17  51  66  61  12  91   5
2  65  53  73   5  31  46  56  49
3  48  76  93  35  11  91  85  64
4  86  96  43  56  79  58  45  55
5  91  54  77  57  91  96  18  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent the item that they value the most among the remaining unallocated items.
2. Continue assigning the highest remaining valued items to the agents until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 0: Highest value is 97 for item 0.
2. Agent 1: Highest value is 91 for item 6.
3. Agent 2: Highest value is 73 for item 2.
4. Agent 3: Highest value is 93 for item 2, but item 2 is taken; next highest value is 91 for item 5.
5. Agent 4: Highest value is 96 for item 1.
6. Agent 5: Highest value is 96 for item 5, but item 5 is taken; next highest value is 91 for item 0, but item 0 is taken; next is 91 for item 4.

After ensuring that each agent has at least one item, we need to allocate the remaining items to maximize the value for the agents:

- Item 3 (66) can be allocated to Agent 1, who values it the most among unallocated items.
- Item 7 (64) can be allocated to Agent 3, who values it the most among unallocated items.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents.
