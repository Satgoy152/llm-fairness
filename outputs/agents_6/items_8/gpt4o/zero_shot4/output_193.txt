Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  46  23  17  87  59  21  39
1  15  77  18  35  18  68  55  32
2  26  57  37  71  78   3  40   9
3   7  50  16  99  17  99  68  47
4  70  68  76  40  80  42  29  94
5  13  76   2  28  26  36  93  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction or fairness. One common approach is to use a method like the Maximum Nash Welfare or Envy-Free allocation, though these can be computationally complex. For simplicity, I'll attempt to allocate items so that each agent gets an approximately fair share based on their highest value preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4, so assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1, so assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3, so assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 5, so assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 7, so assign item 7 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 6, so assign item 6 to agent 5.
7. The remaining items, 0 and 2, can be reassigned to balance any discrepancies:
   - Assign item 0 to agent 4, as they have a moderate valuation of 70.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 5, as they also have a moderate valuation of 2, making the allocation more equitable.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items based on high valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7, 0],
    "5": [6, 2]
}
```
