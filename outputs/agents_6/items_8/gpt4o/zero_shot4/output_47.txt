Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  32  88  83  23  22  84  34
1  76  30  38  30  92  40  35   9
2  89  49  30  44  54  98  69  93
3  17  73  41  34  71  51  85  27
4  92  35  32  58  22  71  99  74
5  20  31  84  62  11  25  67  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that is balanced, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of value based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations first, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Balance the remaining items to maintain fairness in terms of total valuation.

After reviewing the table, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (88)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (92)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (98)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (85)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (92)
- Agent 5: Item 7 (92)

At this point, every agent has one item, and each agent has received an item they highly value.

Now, allocate the remaining 2 items:

- Agent 2: Item 1 (49) - This helps balance the total valuation among agents.
- Agent 3: Item 3 (34) - This balances the allocation further.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and every agent has received at least one item based on their preferences.
