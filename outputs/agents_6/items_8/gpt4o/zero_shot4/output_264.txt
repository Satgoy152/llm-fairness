Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  90  28  65  83   9  50  79
1  48  96  54  86  42  94  11  40
2  29  49  90  77  37  39  89  35
3  16  80   3  16  89  15   4  88
4  20  35  55  34  68  58  41  92
5  62  74  33  21  10   3  11  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations for each agent and try to allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 1 (90) and 4 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 1 (96), 5 (94), and 3 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 2 (90) and 6 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 4 (89), 7 (88), and 1 (80).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 7 (92) and 4 (68).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value items are 1 (74) and 0 (62).

Let's allocate the items by trying to give each agent one of their top choices, ensuring that all items are allocated and no item is allocated to more than one agent:

- Allocate item 1 to **Agent 1** (highest available value for them, 96).
- Allocate item 4 to **Agent 3** (highest available value for them, 89).
- Allocate item 2 to **Agent 2** (highest available value for them, 90).
- Allocate item 5 to **Agent 1** (second highest available value for them, 94).
- Allocate item 7 to **Agent 4** (highest available value for them, 92).
- Allocate item 0 to **Agent 5** (highest available value for them, 62).
- Allocate item 3 to **Agent 0** (highest available value for them after item 1, 65).
- Allocate item 6 to **Agent 2** (second highest available value for them, 89).

Now, each agent has been allocated items according to the above plan.

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This ensures all 8 items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item they highly value.
