Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  33  28  59  19  58  14  28
1  59  42  30  29   3  90   9  74
2  76   3  83  72   1  58  38  40
3   6   3  84  17  37  74  46  76
4  95  37  20  35   5  42  57  25
5  75  51  67  59  85  57  91  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations and ensure each agent gets an appropriate share of items based on their preferences. We also need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item where possible, and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 7, so we allocate item 7 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 0, but since it's taken, we check other items and allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 4, but since it's taken, we check other items and allocate item 6 to agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:
- Item 1 is not yet allocated; we'll give it to agent 0 as they have decent interest in it.
- Item 3 is not yet allocated; we give it to agent 5 as they have decent interest in it.

The allocations are as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.
