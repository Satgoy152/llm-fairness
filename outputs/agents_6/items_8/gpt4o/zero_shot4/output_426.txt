Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73   4  50  78  73  95  68  48
1  21  58  62  74  27  25  72  48
2  72  24  73  77  44  54  84  26
3  80  32  86  45  97  43  59  43
4  38  59  11   0  89  49  48  48
5  41  24  37  57  80  50  56  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to give each agent at least one item, considering their valuations. The goal is to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuation table. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
2. If some agents end up with no items, reassign items from agents who have multiple, ensuring a fair distribution.

Given the table of valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (80).
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most (59).
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (86).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (78).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (97).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (95).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (84).
- Item 7: Agent 5 values it the most (80).

However, Agent 3 has been allocated 3 items, while others have fewer. To ensure fairness, let's adjust:

- Reassign Item 2 from Agent 3 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation of 73).
- Reassign Item 4 from Agent 3 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation of 89).

Now, all agents have at least one item, and we have a fair distribution.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7]
}
```
