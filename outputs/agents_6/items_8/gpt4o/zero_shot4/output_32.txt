Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  91  51  29  88  93  71  27
1  98  86  32  39  75  65  14   0
2  75  61  41  59  71  57  93  65
3  59  70  12  76  23  39   8  91
4  74  77  26  52  67  53  47   1
5  80  28  97  93  44  32  93  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 86 32 39 75 65 14  0]

 [74 77 26 52 67 53 47  1]
 [80 28 97 93 44 32 93 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We will also ensure that only a total of 8 items are allocated. This means some agents may receive more than one item, while others may receive none.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Look for the highest valuation for each item and assign it to that agent.
2. If an agent is receiving more than one item, re-evaluate to ensure a fair distribution.

We'll start by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most. Then, we'll adjust to ensure fairness in allocation.

Let's analyze the table:

- Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 0 (99).
- Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 0 (91).
- Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 5 (97).
- Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 5 (93).
- Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 0 (88).
- Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 0 (93).
- Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 2 (93).
- Item 7: Highest value is by Agent 3 (91).

Initially, this would result in a highly skewed allocation. Let's refine it:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1].
- Agent 1 doesn't get any item due to lower valuations.
- Agent 2 gets item [6].
- Agent 3 gets item [7].
- Agent 4 doesn't get any item due to lower valuations.
- Agent 5 gets items [2, 3].
- Reassign item 4 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation to distribute items fairly), and item 5 to Agent 1 to balance allocation.

Now, let's present the allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and the distribution attempts to balance the interests of maximizing individual agent valuations while ensuring each agent's participation in the allocation process.
