Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  52  21  86  42  73  49  12
1  32  44  24  20  58  95  16  83
2  86  92  36  39  55   1  61  14
3  44  92  37  43  11  25  90  58
4  35  92  50  93  54  35  99  28
5   0  13  42  25   8  75  95  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach, such as maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least some items. A potential strategy is to first assign the items with the highest individual valuations to each agent, and then distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation each agent gets.

Here's a possible allocation that follows this strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent based on their individual preferences.
2. Balance the remaining items to ensure an equitable distribution.

Following this approach, we can achieve a fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one item, and the distribution aims to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
