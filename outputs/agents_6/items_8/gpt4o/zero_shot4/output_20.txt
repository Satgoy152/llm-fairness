Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  60  49  92  35  83  75  19
1  25  27   2  13  38  38  50  48
2  44  54  49  78  44  93  87  54
3  67  69  43  65  86   4  72  18
4  30  45  59  32  56  29  67  50
5  83   7  60  83  90  96  44  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while also ensuring all items are allocated. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Below is an allocation strategy where each agent's total valuation is considered, and we attempt to distribute the items to maximize fairness:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items to agents by ensuring that each agent gets items with the highest value to them.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 53 + 60 + 49 + 92 + 35 + 83 + 75 + 19 = 466
- Agent 1: 25 + 27 + 2 + 13 + 38 + 38 + 50 + 48 = 241
- Agent 2: 44 + 54 + 49 + 78 + 44 + 93 + 87 + 54 = 503
- Agent 3: 67 + 69 + 43 + 65 + 86 + 4 + 72 + 18 = 424
- Agent 4: 30 + 45 + 59 + 32 + 56 + 29 + 67 + 50 = 368
- Agent 5: 83 + 7 + 60 + 83 + 90 + 96 + 44 + 27 = 490

Now, let's assign items to agents based on the highest value they place on each item, while ensuring each item is allocated:

- Item 0: Agent 5 (value 83)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (value 60)
- Item 2: Agent 5 (value 60)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (value 92)
- Item 4: Agent 5 (value 90)
- Item 5: Agent 5 (value 96)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (value 87)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (value 48)

Following this allocation strategy, we achieve the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to an agent who values it highly, and all items are allocated.
