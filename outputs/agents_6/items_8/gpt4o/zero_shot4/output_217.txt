Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  86  76   0  76  44  29  20
1  68  32  12  17  99  84   4  18
2  99  28  99  50  66  79  87  24
3  70  71  17  22  26  63  69  62
4  52  50  32  95  70   4  75  77
5  78  11  83  98  93  74  94  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.

One simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Here's how we can do it for the given table:

1. For each item, find the agent who values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Following these steps, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 2 (99).
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 0 (86).
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 0 (76).
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 5 (98).
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 1 (99).
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 2 (79).
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 5 (94).
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 4 (77).

Now, let's check if this distribution ensures that all agents get an integer number of items. If not, we might need to adjust the allocation slightly to ensure fairness. As it stands, each agent is getting items, and the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
