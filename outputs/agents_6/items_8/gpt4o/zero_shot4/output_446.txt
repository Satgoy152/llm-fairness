Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  34  21  81  14   3  70  28
1  90  96  56  74  69  75  90  78
2  27  66  21  22  98  54  33  19
3  26  61  19  15  45  78   9  13
4  75  30  10  73  36  91  32  60
5  79   6  98  29  99  51  89  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation per item-agent pair until all items are allocated.

Let's examine the optimal allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (96), so assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (96), so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 5 (98), so assign Item 2 to Agent 5.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (81), so assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 5 (99), so assign Item 4 to Agent 5.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (91), so assign Item 5 to Agent 4.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (90), so assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (78), so assign Item 7 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the highest valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
