Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  44  97  76  82  26  56  52
1  71  11   7  43  28   1  24  51
2  80  63   8  17  44  76  41  40
3  36  23  31   3  59  10  27   4
4  62   2  51  66  85  91  34   1
5  97  13  95  57  12  14  27   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Given there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will have more items than others. Let's proceed with an allocation that strives for fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has a particularly high valuation for item 2 (97), so it makes sense to allocate it to them. They also have relatively high valuations for items 1 and 4 compared to other agents. Allocating items 0, 1, and 2 to agent 0 gives them a total valuation of 22 + 44 + 97 = 163.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 (71) highly. Allocating item 0 to agent 1 gives them a total valuation of 71.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 (76) highly, so allocate item 5 to them. This gives them a total valuation of 76.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent does not have particularly high valuation on any item compared to others, but they have relatively higher valuation for item 4 (59) than other agents, so let's assign item 4 to them. This gives them a total valuation of 59.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent has high valuation for item 6 (34) and item 3 (66), so allocate items 3 and 6 to them. This gives them a total valuation of 66 + 34 = 100.

6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 7 (3) the least among all agents, and item 0 (97) the most along with agent 0. Since item 0 is already allocated to agent 1, item 7 can be allocated to agent 5. This gives them a total valuation of 3.

Here is one possible allocation based on the above reasoning:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with some agents receiving more items than others, but overall, the allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their valuations.
