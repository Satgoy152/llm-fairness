Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  32  88  41  37  73  37  33
1   7  20  21  41   6  24  36  80
2  66  96  96  75  63  43  57  26
3  15  23  51  25  39  15  34  27
4  80  61  65  20   9  80  77  50
5  34  98  55   7  55  31  50  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of all agents, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. 

One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item until all items have been distributed. Here is an allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent one item they value the most, if possible.
2. Distribute the remaining items based on second highest valuations, ensuring no agent receives more than two items unless necessary.

By following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (88), so we assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (80), so we assign item 7 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (96), so we assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest, but it is already taken. Their next highest is item 4 (39), so we assign item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (80), so we assign item 0 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 7 the highest, but it is already taken. Their next highest is item 1 (98), but it is also taken. Their next highest available is item 5 (31), so we assign item 5 to agent 5.

With the first pass, all agents except one have one item. We then assign the remaining items (3 and 6) based on the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0's next highest valuation for remaining items is item 6 (37).
- Agent 3's next highest valuation for remaining items is item 3 (25).

Now, all items have been allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
