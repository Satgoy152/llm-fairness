Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  40  89  15  78  78  72  96
1  54  98  14  44  57  48  10  29
2   2  30  67  84   5  51  27  92
3  28  49  72   6  79  41  82  16
4  88   4  48  16   1  85  67  52
5  69  99  87  26   0  23  54  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a number of items corresponding to their valuations, trying to balance the total value each agent receives as much as possible. Given there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 highly at 96, so allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly at 98, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly at 84, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly at 82, so allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 highly at 88, so allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 5 highly at 23, but item 5 is not the highest value for any agent, so allocate item 5 to Agent 5.
7. Consider remaining items 2 and 4:
   - Agent 5 values item 2 highly at 87, so allocate item 2 to Agent 5.
   - Agent 3 values item 4 highly at 79, so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

After allocation, each agent receives:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [6, 4]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [5, 2]

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 2]
}
```
