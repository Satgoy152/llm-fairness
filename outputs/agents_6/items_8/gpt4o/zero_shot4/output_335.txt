Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  51  32   9  35  30  81  67
1  47  14  91  97  44  74  81  58
2  46  55  65  91  98  93  33  84
3  72  56  71  28  10  56  88  78
4  27  20  89  49  77  31  70  31
5  80  66  20  78  42  48  37  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent has a chance to maximize their valuations while achieving an equitable distribution of items. The goal is to allocate 8 items across 6 agents, giving some agents one item and others no items, based on maximizing value.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (87)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (97)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (98)
   - Agent 3: Item 6 (88)
   - Agent 4: Item 2 (89)
   - Agent 5: Item 7 (93)

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 4
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 5

3. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining Items: 1, 5
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 5 (second highest valuation after Item 7)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation after Item 4)

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair chance based on their highest valuations, while distributing the items as evenly as possible.
