Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8   4  35  92  87  71  55  22
1   0  51  70  46  66  24  63  88
2  37  10  52  99  57  47  85  56
3  46  19  43  66   0  73  18  61
4  27  85   9  12  31  79  54  45
5   0   8  25  52  83  58  66  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring every item is allocated. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 7 (88).
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (99), but since it's already taken, the next best is item 6 (85).
4. **Agent 3**: Can take item 5 (73) since it's their highest available valuation.
5. **Agent 4**: Can take item 1 (85), which is their highest available.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation left is item 4 (83).

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Can take item 2 (35) as it's the highest available for them after their first pick.
- **Agent 1**: Can take item 0 (0) as it's the only one left unallocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [7, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed according to the agents' valuations as fairly as possible.
