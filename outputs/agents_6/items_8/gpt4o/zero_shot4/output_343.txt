Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  60  15  48  49  21  99   4
1  30  62  31  61  40  79  28  89
2  20   9   3  14  27  33   4  62
3  81  25  97  84   1  86  33  36
4  70  16  34  48  72  17  73   7
5  72  52  53  87  67  73  18  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 60 15 48 49 21 99  4]
 [30 62 31 61 40 79 28 89]
 [20  9  3 14 27 33  4 62]
 [81 25 97 84  1 86 33 36]
 [70 16 34 48 72 17 73  7]
 [72 52 53 87 67 73 18 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we should ensure each agent receives at least one item, wherever possible, and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent given their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation of 99 for item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation of 89 for item 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation of 62 for item 7 (already taken by Agent 1) and 33 for item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation of 97 for item 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation of 73 for item 6 (already taken by Agent 0) and 72 for item 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Has the highest valuation of 87 for item 3.

Based on these preferences, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6 (99)
- **Agent 1**: Item 7 (89)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (33)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (97)
- **Agent 4**: Item 4 (72)
- **Agent 5**: Item 3 (87)

Now, let's check the unallocated items: 0 and 1.

- **Agent 0**: Could take item 0 (88) since it's their second-highest valuation.
- **Agent 5**: Could take item 1 (52) since it provides a reasonable valuation.

After reallocating, the final allocation is:

- **Agent 0**: Items 6, 0
- **Agent 1**: Item 7
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Item 4
- **Agent 5**: Items 3, 1

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 1]
}
```
