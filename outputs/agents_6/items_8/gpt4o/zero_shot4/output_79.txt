Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13   4  81  97  21  17  31  93
1  89  52  29  35  71  72  18  15
2  44  98  19   2  62  80   8  73
3  33  70  13  29  82  92  27  40
4  83  70  29   6  93  66  39   4
5  46  20   8  54  59  15  62   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. We need to ensure that all 8 items are allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items.

Let's consider the following allocations based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 the highest at 97.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the highest at 89.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 the highest at 98.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 the highest at 92.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 4 the highest at 93.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 6 the highest at 62.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. Let's allocate based on the second-highest valuations:

7. **Agent 0**: Item 7 has a high valuation (93), which is not yet allocated.
8. **Agent 1**: Item 2 has a valuation of 29, which is not yet allocated.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all 8 items have been allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their highest available valuations.
