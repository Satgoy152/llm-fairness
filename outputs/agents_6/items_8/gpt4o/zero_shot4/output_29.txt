Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  15  78  51  55   8  99  40
1  98  72  16  59  55   0  82  68
2   6  94  26  51  89  12  64  70
3  72  21  51  77  50  56  54  11
4  72  83  35  77  97  64  22  47
5  78  27   1   2  90  48  23  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a "round-robin" or "maximal marginal gain" method, where each agent selects the item they value the most from the remaining available items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 99, so allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 98, so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 94, so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 77, so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 97, so allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 the highest at 82, so allocate item 7 to agent 5.

After each agent has received one item, we have 2 items left (2 and 5).

7. Agent 0 values the remaining items 2 and 5, and their next highest valuation is for item 2 at 78, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
8. Agent 4 values item 5 at 64, which is the highest remaining value any agent has for the unallocated items, so allocate item 5 to agent 4.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": [7]
}
```
