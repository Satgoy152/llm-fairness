Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57   2  68  52  52  97  61  33
1  68  20  47  12  88  98  55  73
2  34  60  16  57  43  95  39  64
3  72  14  37  87  68  29  83  93
4  63  29   8  97  39  38  94  55
5  63  81  75  13  84  75  65  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an algorithm that aims to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items to agents based on their preferences, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Iterate over agents and items to refine the allocation to balance total values.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest, but it's already taken by Agent 0, so the next highest value item is 7.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest, but it's already taken, so the next highest value item is 7, which is taken by Agent 1, so we allocate item 3.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest, but it's taken, so we allocate item 3, which is already taken by Agent 2, so we allocate item 0.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the highest.

After this allocation, we ensure at least one item per agent if possible, and that all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
