Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  71  18  31  75  51   0  94
1  32  15  28   6  61  34  44  81
2  73  64   3   4  55  99  67   9
3  66  93  31  97  72  15   4  85
4  65  95  61  19  71  74  79  61
5  56  40  14  40  81  47  77  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 6 agents, we should aim to consider both the total value each agent receives and the distribution of items among the agents. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, at least some agents must receive more than one item. Here's one way to do it:

1. Agent 0 has high valuation for item 7.
2. Agent 1 has a reasonably high valuation for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has a very high valuation for item 5 and 6; however, item 5 is already taken, so item 6 is an option.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3.
5. Agent 4 has high valuation for item 1.
6. Agent 5 has high valuation for item 4; item 4 is the highest value for agent 5.

Let's allocate the items based on these considerations:

- Assign item 7 to agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Assign item 4 to agent 5.

Now, we have 2 remaining items (0 and 2) to allocate. Let's distribute them to the agents:

- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 0).
- Assign item 2 to agent 4 (agent 4 has a reasonably high valuation for item 2).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and distributes items based on their valuations. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [4]
}
```
