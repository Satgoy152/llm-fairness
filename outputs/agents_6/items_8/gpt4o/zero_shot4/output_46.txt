Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  67  28  46  25  13  52  53
1  93  74  63  63  68  86  88  58
2  96  48  83  24  36  35  44  23
3  68  49  76  89  18  56  14  86
4  57  73   3  77   7  14  60  99
5  94  21   3  16  14  10  68  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we should aim to distribute items based on maximizing individual agent's preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. However, given there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will inevitably receive more than one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Prioritize assigning each agent their highest-valued item.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if feasible.
3. Assign remaining items to the agents who value them the most, balancing the total number of items per agent.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 1 (67).
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 0 (93).
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 0 (96). Since item 0 is already allocated, the next highest is item 2 (83).
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 3 (89).
- Agent 4: Highest value is for item 7 (99).
- Agent 5: Highest value is for item 0 (94). Since item 0 is already allocated, the next highest is item 7 (90). However, item 7 is also allocated, so the next highest is item 6 (68).

Now, let's allocate any remaining items:

- Item 4 is unallocated. Agent 1 values it at 68, which is the highest remaining value for any agent for this item.
- Item 5 is unallocated. Agent 1 values it at 86, which is the highest remaining value for any agent for this item.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
