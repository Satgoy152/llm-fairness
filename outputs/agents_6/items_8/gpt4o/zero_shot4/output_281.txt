Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  70  56  33  52  88  49  26
1  51  63   4  64  91  58  89  98
2  27  53   4   6  22   1  10  62
3   8  92  36  63  61  12  83   4
4  60  48   4  27  45  78  99  93
5  24  40   9  58  47  53  65  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated exactly once. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive just one or none. 

Let's start by identifying some potential allocations:

1. Prioritize agents with higher valuations for specific items.
2. Ensure each item is assigned to one agent.
3. Given the constraints, try to balance the allocation across agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 0, as they value item 5 (88) and item 0 (19) the most compared to others who might pick the same item.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 7, as they value item 4 (91) and item 7 (98) the most compared to others.
- Agent 2 receives item 3, as they value it the least, allowing other agents to get more valuable items for them.
- Agent 3 receives item 1, as they value it (92) the most compared to others.
- Agent 4 receives item 6, as they value it the most (99).
- Agent 5 receives item 2, as they value it more than some other agents.

Now let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated once and fairly distributes the items based on agent valuations.
