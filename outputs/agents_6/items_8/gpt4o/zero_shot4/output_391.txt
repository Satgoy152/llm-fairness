Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  18   8  68  52  78  73  19
1  26  51  30  51  63   5  96  98
2   7  53   2  97  73  24  42  16
3  54  16  95  70  98   6  93  75
4  18  16  60  85  84  25  37  20
5  55  62  75  77   1  91  15  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach by trying to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring all items are allocated. One common method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, but also to ensure that each agent gets approximately the same number of items (considering there are more items than agents, some will get more items than others).

Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, not all agents will receive the same number of items. Here's one possible approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the highest value for each item and assign the item to the agent with that highest value.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure that each agent ends up with at least one item, and no agent has a disproportionately large number of items compared to others.

Following these steps, here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 64), item 1 to agent 5 (value 62), item 2 to agent 3 (value 95), item 3 to agent 2 (value 97), item 4 to agent 3 (value 98), item 5 to agent 5 (value 91), item 6 to agent 1 (value 96), and item 7 to agent 1 (value 98).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Note that agent 4 receives no items in this allocation. However, based on the valuations, it might be challenging to allocate an item to agent 4 without significantly reducing the value received by other agents. This allocation prioritizes maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
