Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61   1  92  87  77   1  96  74
1  20  55  13  56  63   5  42   0
2  61  12  35  50  75  77  88  20
3  21   0   7  77  61  32  88  68
4  39  84  40  76  21  70  74  52
5  75  78  72  28  84  78  17  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction. One approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Item 0 has the highest valuation from agent 5 (75).
2. Item 1 has the highest valuation from agent 4 (84).
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (92).
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (87).
5. Item 4 has the highest valuation from agent 5 (84).
6. Item 5 has the highest valuation from agent 5 (78).
7. Item 6 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (96).
8. Item 7 has the highest valuation from agent 5 (99).

Now, we need to ensure a fair distribution, considering the maximum number of items an agent can receive while ensuring all agents have a chance to receive items. Adjustments will be made to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: [2, 3, 6]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [0, 4, 5, 7]

Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering the highest valuations for each item.
