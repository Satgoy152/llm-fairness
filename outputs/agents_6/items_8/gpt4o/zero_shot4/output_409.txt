Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  65  20  22  91  20  55  40
1  89  29  39   8  56  77  71  23
2  21  84  74  16  87  48  68  35
3  55  79  81  63  36  88   0  25
4  86  75  56  33   8  77  64  15
5  61   3  85  85  15  88   9  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll use an approach that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here is the allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (89).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (84).
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most (85).
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it the most (85).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (91).
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most (88).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (68).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (40).

Based on this, here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, ensuring maximum satisfaction based on the provided valuations.
