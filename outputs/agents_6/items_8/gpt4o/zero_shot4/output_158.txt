Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79   4  99  85  52  44  69   7
1  54  75  72  15  27  96  26  77
2  63  58  41  83  10  98  36  54
3   8  43  28  18  40  95  84  40
4  32  81  53  60  29  20  24  80
5  19  69  35  14  65  84  53   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring each agent has an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Since there are 6 agents and 8 items, two agents will need to receive two items each, while the others will receive one item each.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the most (99). Assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the most (96). Assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3 (83). Assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 6 (84). Assign item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the most (81). Assign item 1 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 5 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5 (84). Since item 5 is already allocated, assign the next highest, item 4 (65), to agent 5.

At this point, items 0, 4, and 7 are left unallocated. We need to find a fair allocation for these remaining items.

7. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (79) as it is the highest remaining value for any agent.
8. **Agent 4**: Assign item 7 (80) as it is the highest remaining value for any agent after item 0 is allocated.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [4]
}
```
