Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  81  76  38  68  16  18  32
1  23  79  41  97  36  63  29  29
2  75  53  43  23   7   2  19  41
3  15  75  95   5  73  81  14  92
4  87   8  24  43  68  90  16  16
5  75  84  16  19  79  31   7  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that agents receive items they value highly. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 should get items that maximize their high values.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has relatively uniform low values, so consider giving them a lesser valued item.
- Agent 3 has a very high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 4 has high values spread out, but in particular item 5 is highly valued.
- Agent 5 has a high value for item 1.

Let's distribute the items:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 5 (value 84).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 95).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 97).
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (value 90).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 47).
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 68).
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (value 92).
8. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 19).

This allocation provides each agent with at least one item and distributes the items based on their valuations, ensuring that all items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
