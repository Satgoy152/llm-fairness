Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  85  95   5  49  40  43  77
1  61  71  91  62  52  47  51  97
2  81  47  48  28  15  81  48  45
3  68  80  80  28  13  56  37  40
4  80  98  44  42  95  52   3  43
5  14  71  19  27  40   1  70  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent given their valuations. We aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation of items assigned to each agent is balanced as evenly as possible. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.
2. Distribute remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's go through the table and make the allocations:

- Agent 0: Highest value is item 2 (95).
- Agent 1: Highest value is item 7 (97).
- Agent 2: Highest value is item 0 (81).
- Agent 3: Highest value is item 1 (80).
- Agent 4: Highest value is item 1 (98), but item 1 is already taken. Next highest is item 4 (95).
- Agent 5: Highest value is item 6 (70).

After assigning the items based on the highest valuations:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 7.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 6.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. We choose these items to balance out the total valuations:
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 since they have a high valuation for it (81), and it balances their total.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 5 since they have a relatively higher valuation for it (27).

Now, all 8 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6, 3]
}
```
