Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  45  59  94  25  18  32  39
1  84  21  24  96  67  58   6  78
2   1  77  65  63  77   8  62  65
3  30  10  42  25  77   0  88  74
4   3  16  26   3  82  18  18  28
5  44  25  27   6   6  61   7   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach where we try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent. Let's go through a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If any agent ends up with more than one item, redistribute to balance the allocation.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item or as fairly as possible given the total number of items.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation based on maximizing individual valuations:

- Item 0 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (91).
- Item 1 has the highest valuation from agent 2 (77).
- Item 2 has the highest valuation from agent 0 (59).
- Item 3 has the highest valuation from agent 1 (96).
- Item 4 has the highest valuation from agent 4 (82).
- Item 5 has the highest valuation from agent 5 (61).
- Item 6 has the highest valuation from agent 3 (88).
- Item 7 has the highest valuation from agent 1 (78).

Based on these assignments:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 7.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 5.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are fairly distributed based on the maximum valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
