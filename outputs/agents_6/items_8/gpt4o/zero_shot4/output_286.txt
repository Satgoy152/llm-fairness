Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  87  58   3  29  58  34  14
1  99   3   1  75  59  24  78  28
2   9  84  17   2  23  21  91  60
3  63  92  40  58  76   3  44  65
4  95  52  14  72  99  70  22  21
5  90  13  71  30  32  13   9  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign the highest valued item for each agent:** Start by looking at each agent's highest valued item and try to allocate that item to them if it hasn't been allocated yet.

2. **Allocate remaining items:** For remaining items, distribute them in a way that balances fairness and maximizes overall satisfaction. Consider the next highest valued items for each agent that haven't been allocated yet.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given table:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value item is item 1 (value 87).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value item is item 0 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value item is item 6 (value 91).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value item is item 1 (already taken, next is item 4 with value 76).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value item is item 4 (already taken, next is item 0 with value 95).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest value item is item 0 (already taken, next is item 2 with value 71).

Now, since some items have been taken, we adjust as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Item 1
- **Agent 1:** Item 0
- **Agent 2:** Item 6
- **Agent 3:** Item 4
- **Agent 4:** Item 3 (next highest available is item 3 with value 72)
- **Agent 5:** Item 2

The remaining items (5 and 7) can be allocated based on the next highest preferences:

- **Agent 4:** Item 5 (next highest available is item 5 with value 70)
- **Agent 3:** Item 7 (next highest available is item 7 with value 65)

Given this, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valued items.
