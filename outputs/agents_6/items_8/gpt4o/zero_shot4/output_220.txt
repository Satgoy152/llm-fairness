Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  22  43  51   3  63  52   5
1  86  24  76  14  99  53  89  54
2  50  67  17  64  77  91  43  23
3  51  79   7  74  94  52  90  23
4  77  73  85  56  65  62  40  81
5  16  97  83   4  92  76  73  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and we try to distribute the items based on the valuations given, aiming for a fair distribution.

Let's go through a potential allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for item 0. Allocating item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 4. Allocating item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 5. Allocating item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 6. Allocating item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 2. Allocating item 2.
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation for item 1. Allocating item 1.

Now, we have 2 items left (items 3 and 7) to allocate. Let's distribute these based on the remaining valuations:

7. **Item 3**: Agent 3 has the highest remaining valuation for item 3. Allocate item 3 to agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 has the highest remaining valuation for item 7. Allocate item 7 to agent 4.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item based on their valuations.
