Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  96  75  94  95  70   5  38
1   0  86  75  89   1  88  19  41
2  29  87  24  25  90  30  56   1
3  98  24  19  86  10  14  39  69
4  11  87  15  32  32  40  44  42
5  70  50  21  28  81  80  87  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed. One possible approach is to try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring fairness. Below is one potential allocation based on the valuations:

- Assign items such that the total value each agent receives is relatively balanced.
- Ensure that each item is assigned to one unique agent.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 4 and 6.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.
- Agent 4 receives item 7.
- Agent 5 receives no items.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
