Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  57  79  15   6  64  93  92
1  11   2  29  75  67  40  30  16
2  34  70  54  16  42  43  57  61
3  24  88   4  20  84  33  11  36
4   2  18   4  14  88  53  67  91
5  52  69  70   1  34  81   6  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the total utility or value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents may receive one item, and others may receive two, while some may not receive any item. 

We can start by looking for the highest valuations for each item and assign those items to the respective agents. This method ensures that the overall satisfaction is maximized. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 0 (value 36).
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 3 (value 88).
3. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0 (value 79).
4. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 1 (value 75).
5. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 4 (value 88).
6. Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 5 (value 81).
7. Item 6 has the highest value for Agent 0 (value 93).
8. Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 0 (value 92).

Now let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 has been assigned 4 items (0, 2, 6, 7), which is excessive. We need to reassign some items.
- To adjust, let's reassign some items from Agent 0 to others while maintaining high valuations:
  - Assign Item 7 to Agent 4 (value 91) instead of Agent 0.
  - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (value 57) instead of Agent 0.

This leaves us with:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [1]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 5: Items [5]

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, each agent receives a fair share based on valuations, and no agent receives more than they need at the expense of total utility.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
