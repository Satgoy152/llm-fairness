Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  60  89  63  56  92  43  87
1  49  84   8  14  76  81  39  66
2  66  12  78  23  40  20  75  64
3  80  35  40  23  80  32  43  17
4  32  67   9  83  29  48  95  31
5  91   1  76  69  97  53  68  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Given that there are six agents and eight items, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item where possible, but we must ensure all items are allocated. 

Letâ€™s allocate the items based on the highest valuations by each agent:

1. **Item 5** has a high value for Agent 0 (92), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1** has a high value for Agent 1 (84), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2** has a high value for Agent 2 (78), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 0** has a high value for Agent 3 (80), so allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Item 6** has a high value for Agent 4 (95), so allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Item 4** has a high value for Agent 5 (97), so allocate item 4 to Agent 5.
7. **Item 3**: Among the remaining agents, Agent 4 values item 3 the most (83), so allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
8. **Item 7**: Among the remaining agents, Agent 0 values item 7 the most (87), so allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6, 3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their valuations where possible.
