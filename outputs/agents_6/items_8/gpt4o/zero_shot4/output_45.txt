Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  79  28  94  75  20  97  11
1  55  56  34  19  99  47   7  77
2  84  15  96  33   6  42  87  86
3  25  16  59  60  58  46   4  73
4  74  20  74  46  33  24   9  82
5  53   8  99  89  42  77  84  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation and tries to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. One way to approach this is to assign items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: For each item, identify which agent values it the most. This will help ensure that the items are allocated to agents who value them the most.
   
2. **Allocate items**: Distribute the items to the respective agents based on the identified highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (valuation 84)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (valuation 79)
- Item 2: Agent 5 (valuation 99)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (valuation 94)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (valuation 99)
- Item 5: Agent 5 (valuation 77)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (valuation 97)
- Item 7: Agent 2 (valuation 86)

Now, let's organize these allocations into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, with Agent 0 getting three items, Agent 1 getting one item, Agent 2 getting two items, and Agent 5 getting two items, while Agents 3 and 4 receive no items. This ensures that all 8 items are allocated and the distribution respects the agents' valuations.
