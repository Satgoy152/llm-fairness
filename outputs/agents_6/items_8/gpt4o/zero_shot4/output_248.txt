Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14   8  85  21  16  71  74  45
1  23  52  62  17  37  77  31  29
2  28  18   1   6  80   1  85   7
3  74  32  40  59  28  44  20  38
4   2  40  17   4  79  43  68  50
5  39  19   0  69  63   6  40  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Here's a possible allocation that seeks to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Determine the total number of items, which is 8.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their highest valuations.

Given the valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (85).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (77).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (85).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (74).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (79).
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most (69).

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated, so we will also consider secondary preferences:

- Agent 0 can take item 7 (45) after item 2.
- Agent 1 can take item 1 (52) after item 5.
- Since agent 2 and agent 3 have their highest preference items allocated, no additional items need to be given to them.
- Agent 4 has item 4 already and does not need additional items for fair distribution.
- Agent 5 can take item 4 (63) after item 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent's preferences are considered while distributing all 8 items fairly.
