Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  81  26  21  62  23  19  49
1  90  94  18  12  88   2  66  54
2  86  20  23  51  95  51  36  56
3   0  23  63  99  48   5  13  64
4  35  78  32  54  67  25  19  17
5  34   8   9  35  93  24  21  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[90 81 26 21 62 23 19 49]
 [90 94 18 12 88  2 66 54]
 [86 20 23 51 95 51 36 56]
 [ 0 23 63 99 48  5 13 64]
 [35 78 32 54 67 25 19 17]
 [34  8  9 35 93 24 21 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can use the idea of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated. We need to ensure that the allocation is balanced and that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Items 2, 5, 6

Let's verify that each agent is allocated a fair share of items based on their valuations and ensure that the total number of items allocated is 8. This allocation also attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of agents based on their valuations.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, except Agent 5, who receives three items to balance the allocation.
