Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62   7  90  58  50  48  91  45
1  56  99  86  25  68   8  73  98
2  12  21   5  92  16   6  11  75
3  25  73  64  15  20  18  76  23
4  99  28  60  55  57  31   0  28
5  14  65  30  77  50  66  91  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent. This requires ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, while also considering their highest valued items.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify the highest value for each agent and allocate that item if not already taken:**

   - Agent 0: Highest value is 91 for item 6.
   - Agent 1: Highest value is 99 for item 1.
   - Agent 2: Highest value is 92 for item 3.
   - Agent 3: Highest value is 76 for item 6 (already taken by Agent 0), so next highest is 73 for item 1 (already taken by Agent 1), so next highest is 64 for item 2.
   - Agent 4: Highest value is 99 for item 0.
   - Agent 5: Highest value is 91 for item 6 (already taken by Agent 0), so next highest is 77 for item 3 (already taken by Agent 2), so next highest is 66 for item 5.

2. **Allocate remaining items:**
   After assigning the highest valued items, we have the following items still unallocated: [4, 7].

3. **Assign remaining items to the agents with the next highest preferences ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible:**

   - For item 4:
     - Agent 1 has value 68 (highest among unallocated items).
   - For item 7:
     - Agent 1 also has value 98 (highest among unallocated items).

4. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 4, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is considered for their highest valued items and that all items are fairly distributed based on the initial values given.
