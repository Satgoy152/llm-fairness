Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  70  20  12  80  78   8  92
1  11  75  62  36   7  15   1  84
2  12   3  54  66  54  85  23  15
3  42  13  46  79  85  50  62  26
4  32  50  25  84  59   0  64  17
5  47  40  83  22  79  22  34  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we can use a simple algorithm that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations. We'll ensure that each agent gets a fair distribution of items, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 8.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 7 (92) and 4 (80). Allocate items 7 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values are for items 1 (75) and 7 (84). Item 7 is already allocated, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 5 (85). Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values are for items 4 (85) and 3 (79). Item 4 is already allocated, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 3 (84), which is already allocated. The next highest is item 6 (64). Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest values are for items 2 (83) and 4 (79), both of which are already allocated. The next highest available is item 0 (47). Allocate item 0 to Agent 5.

The allocation so far includes items 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, totaling 7 items. We need to allocate one more item. The remaining item is 2, which can be allocated to Agent 5 since they have the next highest valuation (83) for it and have received fewer items compared to some other agents.

Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed across the agents, maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations.
