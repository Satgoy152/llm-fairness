Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  22  22   9   3  30  47  64
1   2  45  22   0  95  40  79  50
2  65  58  48  77  50   6  58  33
3  23  78   5  56   9  40  40   8
4  29  18   7  60  87  64   6  69
5  93  71  62  43   9  44  90  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute them such that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value. One potential approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 5 (value 93).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 78).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 5 (value 62).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 77).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 95).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 4 (value 64).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 47).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 5 (value 96).

Given these assignments, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving at least one item, based on their highest valuations.
