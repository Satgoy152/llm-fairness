Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  46   4  70  87  18  48  64
1  37  14  12  94  72  90  78  40
2  90  49  31  19  62  64  41  68
3   2  19  30  28  71  55  27  83
4  83  51  74  94  91  22   4  91
5  17  13   0  60  36  29  62  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent is allocated one item based on their highest valuation for an item that hasn't been allocated yet. We will then allocate the remaining items to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Let's start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 87.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 94.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 90.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the highest at 83.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest at 94, but it's already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is item 4 at 91, but it's already taken by Agent 0. Then, item 7 at 91 is available.
6. Agent 5 values item 6 the highest at 62.

Now, let's allocate a second round of items to ensure all items are allocated:

1. The remaining items are: 1, 2, and 5.
2. Agent 0's next highest value for an available item is item 1 at 46.
3. Agent 1's next highest value for an available item is item 5 at 90.
4. Agent 2's next highest value for an available item is item 2 at 31.

Now, let's format the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [6]
}
```
