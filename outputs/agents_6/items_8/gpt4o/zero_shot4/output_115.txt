Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  10   7  10  34  63  40  94
1  60  64  81  81  59  19  54  43
2  95  47  54  51  49  20  60  34
3   3  64  77  52  65  29  83   5
4  50  25  10  88  56  52  79   0
5  81  66   1  56  74  65  11  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction, or total valuation, of the items assigned to each agent. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

Based on the provided table, here's a potential fair allocation of items to agents:

1. Assign item 7 to agent 0 because they value it the most (value 94).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because they value it the most (value 81).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2 because they value it the most (value 95).
4. Assign item 6 to agent 3 because they value it the most (value 83).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 4 because they value it the most (value 88).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5 because they value it the most (value 65).
7. Assign item 1 to agent 1 because they value it highly (value 64) and it helps balance the number of items.
8. Assign item 4 to agent 5 because they also value it highly (value 74).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```
