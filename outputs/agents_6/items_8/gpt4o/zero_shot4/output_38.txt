Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  25  28   8  83  14  79  77
1  90   3  20  37  47  82  78  11
2  49  84  10  27  82  22  57  76
3  16   8  37  53   5  50  53  32
4  32   3  52  15  18  12  77  56
5  67   6  33  21  92  60   5  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 6 agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value of items allocated to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, where possible. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, two agents will receive two items, and the rest will receive one.

Let's analyze the values for each item across all agents and allocate them accordingly to maximize fairness:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 90.
   
2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 84.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 28.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 53.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 5 values it the highest at 92.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 82.
   
7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 79.
   
8. **Item 7:**
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 76.

Now let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 7
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: (No item)
- Agent 5: Item 4

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4]
}
```
