Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  87   9  81  34  93  84  70
1  95  41  68  15   5  18  44  10
2  57  20  62  52  82  90  62  93
3  13  76  49  57  28  81  36  55
4  60  66  14  76   2  46  65  97
5  55  43  76  22  43  24  57  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. We can do this by trying to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's analyze and allocate the items based on the valuations:

1. Identify the highest valuations for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate items such that the overall satisfaction (total valuation) is maximized.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (valuation: 93)
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (valuation: 95)
- Agent 2 gets items 4 and 7 (valuations: 82 and 93)
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (valuation: 76)
- Agent 4 gets item 3 (valuation: 76)
- Agent 5 gets items 2 and 6 (valuations: 76 and 57)

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned and the distribution is fair in terms of maximizing individual agent satisfaction based on their highest valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```
