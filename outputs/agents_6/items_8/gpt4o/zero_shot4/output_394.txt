Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  78  98  25  45  58   1  87
1  14  73  80  27  56  44  79  17
2   8  31  50  53  74  38  64  64
3  37  48  40  23  43  11  76  11
4  14  59  50  46  49  21  94  10
5  90  21  35  14  59  31  77  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly, so we assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 highly, so we assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly, so we assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 highly, so we assign item 7 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highly, but since it is already assigned, we look at the next highest value, which is item 1, and assign it to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 highly, so we assign item 0 to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. We need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 5.

7. Agent 1 values item 3 relatively well compared to others, so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
8. Agent 0 values item 5 relatively well, so we assign item 5 to agent 0.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```
