Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  92  45  58  11   6  47  50
1  91  87  63   0  65   2   8  10
2  95  41  29  57  36  80  25  36
3  39  34  35  50  13   3  28   8
4  76  12  79  61  78  21  83  22
5   5  77  53  83  39  25   6  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the overall valuations and try to balance the distribution. Here's a possible allocation that respects these requirements:

1. **Agent 0**:  Let's allocate item 0 and item 1 because they have high valuations from agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**:  We can allocate item 4, as agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for it.
3. **Agent 2**:  Allocate item 5 to agent 2, as they have a high valuation for this item.
4. **Agent 3**:  Allocate item 3 to agent 3, given their relatively high valuation for it.
5. **Agent 4**:  Allocate item 2 and item 6 to agent 4, as they have high valuations for these items.
6. **Agent 5**:  Allocate item 7 to agent 5, as they have a decent valuation for it.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and every item is allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [7]
}
```
