Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  87  65  91  24  92  81  55
1   4  30   0   0  53  58   1   5
2  41  37  71  31  98  26  37  44
3  61  25  59  23   5  39  46  33
4  22  77  74  70   9  23   8   5
5   3  33  83   9   8  85  65  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations, ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent.
2. Continue to allocate items to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Using the given valuation table, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4, but since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1, Agent 2 can get item 2.
- Agent 3 does not have any standout high valuations, but could benefit from item 6.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 5, but since item 5 is already allocated, Agent 5 can receive item 7.

Based on the above strategy, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is distributed and each agent receives items. Note that this is just one of many possible fair allocations based on the table provided.
