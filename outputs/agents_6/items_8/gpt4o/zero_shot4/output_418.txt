Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  34  15  58  61  46  46  73
1  80  23  29  41  59  86  45  18
2  44  30   6  42  37   5  21  45
3  37  40   6  19  89  41   2   5
4  46   2  70   0  59  53  33  40
5  85  46  32  66  61  46  55  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy allocation method. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Rank Items by Valuation:** For each agent, rank the items based on the agent's valuation in descending order. This gives us a sense of preference for each agent.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Begin by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most, provided that agent hasn't reached their maximum number of items.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Make sure each agent gets at least one item if possible and adjust allocations to ensure fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Highest valuation allocations:**
   - Item 0: Agent 5 (value = 85)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value = 34)
   - Item 2: Agent 4 (value = 70)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (value = 58)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (value = 89)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (value = 86)
   - Item 6: Agent 5 (value = 55)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (value = 73)

2. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Agent 0 has 3 items (1, 3, and 7).
   - Agent 5 has 2 items (0 and 6).
   - Agents 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have 1 item.
   - Ensure that allocations are spread fairly given each agent's high valuation preferences.

Here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint that each agent has an integer number of items, with exactly 8 items allocated in total.
