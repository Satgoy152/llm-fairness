Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  88  73  92  30   7  29  46
1  63  39  41  97  20  16  83  81
2  28  95  27  34  63  23  93  24
3   0  69   7   3  24  47  33  50
4  22  31   0  76  72  44  56   3
5  43  95  58  54  77  75  51  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [63 39 41 97 20 16 83 81]
 [28 95 27 34 63 23 93 24]

 [43 95 58 54 77 75 51 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation of the items they receive is as balanced as possible compared to other agents. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Sort each agent's valuations in descending order to prioritize higher-valued items.
2. Allocate items in such a way that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the total valuations are balanced.

Here is an allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the most.

Now, we'll distribute the items considering these preferences and try to balance the total value:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 7.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets items 0, 2, and 5.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.

Final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
