Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  25  70  14  63  98  83  56
1  77  11  61  31   7  14  99  13
2   2   5   4  53   0  19  60  31
3  73  44  86  49  37  60  26   4
4  97  50   7   5  41  12  78  70
5   4  24  72  30  55  59  24  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible, and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Considering the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (98).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (53).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (86).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (97).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (72).

Based on these observations, we can start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent, then distribute any remaining items in a way that maintains fairness in the distribution.

Let's assign items based on the highest valuations, ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 8:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.
- Agent 4 gets item 0.
- Agent 5 can get item 4.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items to make a total of 8 items. Let's look at the remaining items and allocate them to agents who would benefit from additional items:

- Agent 0 can also get item 7 (56).
- Agent 3 can also get item 1 (44).

The allocations can now be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the best possible items based on their highest valuations, while also ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.
