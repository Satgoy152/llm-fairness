Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  83  29  62  90  37  29  66
1  57  58  16  74  32  81   9  55
2  63  17  31  18  14  49  89   6
3  96  44  32  20  66  48  94  94
4  89  37   6  16  89  99  27  75
5   7  28  24   5  25  52  72  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share of total value according to their preferences. Here's one possible allocation that ensures all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share:

1. Examine the highest valuation for each item across all agents and allocate the item to the agent who values it most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, to keep the allocation fair.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 96.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 83.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 29.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 74.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 90.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it at 99.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it at 94.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it at 94.

Now let's distribute the items such that every agent gets at least one item and the allocation is fair:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0, 6, 7]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: []

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 6, 7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": []
}
```

This ensures all 8 items are allocated across the agents, focusing on maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
