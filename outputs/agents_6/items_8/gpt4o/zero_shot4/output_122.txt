Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  66  91  91  63  33  14  55
1  67  27  32  23  21  51  21  88
2  79  86  51  86  14  65  18  50
3  98  55  64  26  16  90  90  54
4  10  18  24  62  13  53   6  46
5  54  47  14  54  27  10  27  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes total valuation and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This will ensure that the total valuation is maximized:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most with 98.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most with 86.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with 91.
- Item 3: Agent 0 and Agent 2 value it equally with 86, so we can assign it to either. Letâ€™s assign it to Agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with 63.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most with 90.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most with 90.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most with 88.

Following this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 7.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 3 receives items 0, 5, and 6.
- Agent 4 receives no items.
- Agent 5 receives no items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 5, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, considering ties, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
