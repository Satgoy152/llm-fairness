Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  97  13  54  90  52  91  65
1  90  59  43  34  49  24  59  34
2  25  36   7  89  32  36   4  14
3  56  89  12  23  49  42   0  47
4  32  90  98   3  90  48  23  98
5  50  96  54  70  50  10  95  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the values each agent places on the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction or value derived by the agents. One common approach is to use a greedy method where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation based on this principle:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (97). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (90). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (89). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most but it's already taken. The next highest value is for item 7 (47). Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most (98). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 the most but it's already taken. The next highest value is for item 6 (95). Assign item 6 to Agent 5.
7. Remaining items are 4 and 5. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4 (90), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
8. Agent 4 also has a high value for item 5 (48), so assign item 5 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it most highly among the remaining options.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
