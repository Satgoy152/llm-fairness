Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62   7  38  71  15  41  47   5
1  32  94  91  35  85  28  58  92
2  48  87  53  60  56  54  78  99
3  56  39  88  51  67   4  26   0
4  24  24  23  51  44  55  85  39
5  57  58  23  69  33  91   6  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider various strategies such as maximizing the total value for each agent or ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible across all agents. Here's one possible allocation approach based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 1 values item 1 and item 7 the most, so we allocate them to Agent 1.
2. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 7, but it's already allocated, so we give them item 6, which is also highly valued by Agent 2.
3. Agent 3 values item 2 highly, so we allocate it to Agent 3.
4. Agent 5 values item 5 highly, so we allocate it to Agent 5.
5. Agent 0 values item 3 highly, so we allocate it to Agent 0.
6. Agent 4 values item 6 highly, but it's already allocated, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 4 since it's also valued reasonably.
7. Allocate remaining items (0 and 4) to ensure each agent has at least one item or to balance the allocation further.

Here's a fair allocation given these considerations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, balancing the distribution fairly given the initial valuations.
