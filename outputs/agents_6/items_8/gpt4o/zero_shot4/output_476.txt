Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  82  93  67  68  69  83   9
1  76  79  56  78  87   3  63  60
2  73   2  39  74  97  20  26  45
3  83  71  40  82  98  88  91   5
4  52  78  66  84  33  36  76  41
5  54  42  38  87  36  51  98  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonably balanced share based on their valuations. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest individual valuations and distribute the remaining items considering the overall balance.

Here is a proposed allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (93).
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly (87).
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly (97), but since Agent 1 has already been considered for item 4, we'll give Agent 2 their next highest, item 3 (74).
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (98), but since Agent 4 has been considered, we'll give Agent 3 their next highest, item 0 (83).
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly (84).
- Agent 5 values item 6 highly (98).

Now, we need to distribute the remaining items 1, 5, and 7 taking into account the remaining preferences and ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 also values item 1 highly (82), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 can receive item 7 (60).
- Agent 2 can receive item 5 (20).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while trying to respect the highest valuations of each agent.
