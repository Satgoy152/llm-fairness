Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  79  48  59  42  23  50  90
1  92   4  70  10  53  55  57  19
2  64  26  36  27   4  10  40  46
3  22  68   2  67  94  25  57  53
4  76  97  76  87  23  51  23  72
5   4  80  20  17  11  39  93  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each receives an integer number of items, we can aim to optimize for the highest value each agent places on the items they receive. We'll try to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item and that the total number of allocated items is exactly 8.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **Sort items by value per agent:** Start by identifying which items each agent values the most.

2. **Allocate items:** Distribute items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 7 highest (value = 90).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 0 highest (value = 92).
- **Agent 2:** Values item 0 highest (value = 64), but since item 0 is already assigned, consider next highest valued available item, which is item 7 (value = 46).
- **Agent 3:** Values item 4 highest (value = 94).
- **Agent 4:** Values item 1 highest (value = 97).
- **Agent 5:** Values item 6 highest (value = 93).

After assigning each agent one item based on their highest valuation, we have:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [6]

Now, allocate remaining items to maximize value:

- **Remaining items:** 2, 3, 5

Continuing to allocate based on remaining values:

- **Agent 0:** Next highest value item is 1, but it's taken, so consider item 3 (value = 59).
- **Agent 1:** Next highest value item is 2 (value = 70).
- **Agent 2:** Next highest value item is 2, but it's taken, consider next highest value item, which is item 5 (value = 10).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [7, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [6]

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed, considering each agent's preferences to the extent possible.

### Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```
