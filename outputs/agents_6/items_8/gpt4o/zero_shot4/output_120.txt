Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  40  49  78  92  90  28  15
1  11   4  90  83  44  71  63   0
2  28  49  70  44  36  49  78  41
3  37  70  21  50   3  94  86   2
4  19  88  22   8  93  70  30  28
5  62   5  33  33  22  44   8  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 with a value of 92.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 with a value of 90.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 6 with a value of 78.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 5 with a value of 94.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 1 with a value of 88.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 7 with a value of 66.
7. Next, we consider the remaining items:
    - Item 0 has a high value for Agent 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
    - Item 3 has a high value for Agent 1, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations for the items.
