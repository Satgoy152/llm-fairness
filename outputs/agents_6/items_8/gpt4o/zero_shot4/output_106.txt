Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  78  31  25  88   3  23  70
1  83  61  12  56  38  88  51  98
2  13   2  29  70  92  87  72  39
3  60  50  82  30  70   5  70  31
4  65   2  43  93  97  71  34  36
5  39  81  92  36  14  93  80   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share. We have 8 items and 6 agents, so some agents may receive more items than others.

Let's examine the table and find an allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value = 83).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 5 (value = 81).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (value = 92).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (value = 93).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value = 88).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 5 (value = 93).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value = 72).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value = 98).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, the total number of items allocated is 8, and each agent is included in the JSON, even if they receive no items.
