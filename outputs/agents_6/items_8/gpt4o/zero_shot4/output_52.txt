Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37   8  39  65  47  84  10  85
1  24  89  94  56  19  74  58   9
2  42  11  24  79  43  85  78  82
3  63   5  59  38  89  58  86  86
4  39  26  52  85  89   0  19  96
5  86  14  66  95  18  74  44  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [86 14 66 95 18 74 44 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method like the "max-min fair allocation" approach, which aims to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives. Given the valuations, we can start by assigning items to agents in a way that tries to balance the total value each agent receives.

Below is an allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 5 (value = 95)
2. Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value = 89)
3. Assign item 0 to agent 5 (value = 86)
4. Assign item 7 to agent 4 (value = 96)
5. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value = 85)
6. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value = 89)
7. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value = 86)
8. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value = 39)

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item where it maximizes their valuation based on available options, and all 8 items are allocated.
