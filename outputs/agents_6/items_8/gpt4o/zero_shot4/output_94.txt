Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  29  13  97  91  16  35  73
1  54  83  89  24   4  73  50  15
2  16  31  25  49  39  40  85  62
3  57  89   9  93  90  99  92  11
4  42  66  56   5  44  64   0  23
5  90  16   8  93  81  30  89   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the highest valuation each agent has for any item, and try to allocate that item to the respective agent, ensuring no two agents receive the same item.
2. If a conflict arises (i.e., two agents have the highest valuation for the same item), resolve it by comparing the second-highest valued item for each agent involved in the conflict and so on.
3. Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given table:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 5.
- Agent 5 highly values item 0.
- Agent 4 should get item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 6.
- Agent 3 should also get item 4.
- Agent 0 should get item 7.

Let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.
