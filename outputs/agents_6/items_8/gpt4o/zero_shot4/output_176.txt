Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  14  79  32  97  34  85   3
1  40  99  53  37  49  44  10  31
2  59  84  88  82  58   9  96  32
3  36  12  94   6  56  24  34  67
4  39  66   7  91  18  36  87  64
5  77  48  39  68  43  42  22  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure each agent gets an allocation based on their valuations, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. To achieve this, we can consider each agent's highest-valued items and distribute them accordingly, ensuring no item is left unallocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 4 (value 97), followed by 0 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 1 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 6 (value 96), followed by 2 (value 88).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 2 (value 94).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 3 (value 91).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is item 0 (value 77).

Using the above preferences, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: Gets item 4.
- Agent 1: Gets item 1.
- Agent 2: Gets items 6 and 2.
- Agent 3: Gets item 7.
- Agent 4: Gets item 3.
- Agent 5: Gets items 0 and 5.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items based on their highest preferences while all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```
