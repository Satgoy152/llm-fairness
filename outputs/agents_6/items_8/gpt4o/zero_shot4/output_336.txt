Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  90  20  70  93  68  88  97
1  24  44  99  30   2  47  66   8
2  14  71  32  73  43  38  77  86
3  76  70  24  85  97  93  50  56
4   1  69  91   5  18  38  29  16
5   6  24  53  86  95  92   5  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 2, but item 2 is better for Agent 1.
6. **Agent 5** values item 4 highly, but since Agent 3 values it more, we'll consider alternatives.

By analyzing these preferences and balancing allocations, we can devise a fair allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (to balance allocations).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (due to high value).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it highly).

This allocation aims to maximize the number of high-value items each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```
