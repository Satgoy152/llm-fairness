Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  57  63  49  32  46  57   5
1  29  83   1  66  51   2  49  24
2  58  36  27  23  91  35  59  14
3   5  20  72  11  67  45  56  16
4  55  84  34  31  75  80  72  37
5  39  61   0   2  78  75  28  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. We can use a simple heuristic approach to balance the allocations by maximizing overall satisfaction, which can be measured by the agents' valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: [0, 1] 
   - Total Value: 39 + 57 = 96

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items: [3, 6] 
   - Total Value: 66 + 49 = 115

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items: [4] 
   - Total Value: 91

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items: [2] 
   - Total Value: 72

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Items: [5] 
   - Total Value: 80

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Items: [7] 
   - Total Value: 51

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and it aims to maximize the total value received by each agent based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7]
}
```
