Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  21  71  84  81  29  79  77
1  12  67   0  26   8  98  46   9
2  94  84   7  59  52   7  53  35
3  37  14  71  43  55  70  99  28
4  24  63  67  90  61  35  39  40
5  89   3  12   9  71  80  79  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations and try to allocate the items as fairly as possible:

Item valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value to agent 2 (94)
- Item 1: Highest value to agent 1 (67)
- Item 2: Highest value to agents 0 and 3 (71)
- Item 3: Highest value to agent 4 (90)
- Item 4: Highest value to agent 0 (81)
- Item 5: Highest value to agent 1 (98)
- Item 6: Highest value to agent 3 (99)
- Item 7: Highest value to agent 0 (77)

Let's allocate the items based on highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: No items

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations, with some priority given to ensuring each agent receives items they highly value.
