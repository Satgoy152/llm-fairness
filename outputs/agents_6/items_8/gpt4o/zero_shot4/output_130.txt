Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  87  98  83  55  28  82  78
1  94  20   6  25  88  67  16  36
2  24  56  83  63  54  24  28  22
3  67  12  37  12  59  52  44  33
4  13  37  79   3  98  36   7  56
5  30  15  51   1  88  83  67  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We'll allocate items one by one, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't yet reached their fair share of items. Since there are 6 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally get 1 or 2 items.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most with 98, so we assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most with 94, so we assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2, but it's taken, so we check the next highest value, which is item 3 with 63. We assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0, which is taken, and item 4, which is valued at 59. We assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4, but it's taken, so we check the next highest value, which is item 2, but it's also taken. The next highest is item 6 with 7, but we check further down to find item 4 with 98. We assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 4, but it's taken, so we assign item 5 with 83 to Agent 5.

Now we have assigned 6 items, and we need to assign 2 more items. We'll distribute the remaining items among the agents who have fewer items:

7. Agent 0 gets item 1 with 87 (next highest value).
8. Agent 2 gets item 7 with 22 (to balance distribution).

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation balances the distribution of items and aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Note that Agent 4 did not receive any items due to the high competition for other items.
