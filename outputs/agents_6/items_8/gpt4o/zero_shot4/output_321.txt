Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  78  75   9   4  53  54  89
1  45  23  45  95  16  27  44   6
2  69  72  52  64  82  93  97  20
3  33  68  83  91  51  69   9  59
4  46  70  51  84  62  69  39   6
5  76  35  43  44  70  61  30  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction or perceived value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given that we have 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will get more than one item, and some might get only one or none. Here's a possible fair allocation approach:

1. First, identify the items that each agent values the most.
2. Allocate those items to the respective agents.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives a reasonable distribution of value according to their preferences.

Based on the given values in the table, here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3, but it's already taken, so we consider the next highest value item that isn't taken.
- Agent 4 values item 3, but it's already taken, so we consider the next highest value item that isn't taken.
- Agent 5 values item 0, but it's already taken, so we consider the next highest value item that isn't taken.

Here's a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, with some consideration for each agent's preferences.
