Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  16  88  15  77  67  67  16
1  24  83  63  14  61  45  12  91
2   8  17  20  52  79  12  14  20
3  22   5  52  25  80  35  14   8
4  64  12  52  37  46  94  72  53
5  62  25  92   1  62  89  48  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, each agent should get at least one item, with some agents possibly getting two items, while ensuring that the total number of allocated items is exactly 8.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can follow a method where we look for the highest value each agent places on the available items and allocate accordingly, while ensuring not to exceed the total item count.

Here is one possible allocation of items to agents:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly, so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly, so assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly, so assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly, but since it has been assigned, assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly, so assign item 5 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly, but since it has been assigned, assign item 0 to Agent 5.

Now, we still have items 1 and 6 unallocated. Let's assign them to the agents who have received only one item:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (as they have a high valuation for it).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 5 (as they have a reasonable valuation for it).

Now, the allocation is complete, with all items assigned:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
