Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  30  90  94  28  79  48  60
1  82  64  68  17  84  50  29  43
2  35  24  74  71  25  97  68  86
3  23  16  19  78   2  64  34  13
4  65  71  86  76  80  12  85  40
5  75  69  99  26   1  86  35  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 30 90 94 28 79 48 60]
 [82 64 68 17 84 50 29 43]
 [35 24 74 71 25 97 68 86]
 [23 16 19 78  2 64 34 13]
 [65 71 86 76 80 12 85 40]
 [75 69 99 26  1 86 35 52]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. We'll aim to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is roughly balanced. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items with values that maximize their total valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items that maximize their total value without overlapping with already allocated items.
3. **Agent 2**: Continue the process ensuring no overlap and maximizing value.
4. **Agent 3**: Similarly, assign items maximizing value.
5. **Agent 4**: Ensure they get items, maximizing their value.
6. **Agent 5**: Assign remaining items.

After examining the table and balancing the values among the agents, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 1, 6

This allocation considers the total valuation for each agent and ensures all items are allocated without exceeding the limit of 8 items. 

The JSON representation of this allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
