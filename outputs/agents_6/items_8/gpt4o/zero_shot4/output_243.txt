Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  50   7  50  47  23  72   9
1  92  79  76  72  94  15  28  72
2  68   1  33  22  49  20  80  79
3  56   7  84  20  76   3  14  14
4  44  42  14  83  41  80  87  51
5  53  13   3  17  53  41   9  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that the distribution is as balanced as possible. Given the valuations, one potential approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least some opportunity to acquire items. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 6 and 1 highly.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 2.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 4 highly values items 6 and 5.
- Agent 5 does not have particularly high valuations, so they may receive items with lower demand.

Here is a sample allocation:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [3, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share considering their preferences while distributing all items. The JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3, 7]
}
```
