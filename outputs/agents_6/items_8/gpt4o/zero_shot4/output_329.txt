Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  37  73  41  32   8  88  53
1  20   7  75  40  49  15  80   1
2  34  99  23  90  60   4  72  43
3   7  49  20  72  72  72  76  85
4  52  67  40  46  24  86  23  19
5  71   3   9  84  57  35  21  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to the items. A common approach for fairness is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, and that the total allocation across all agents is fair in terms of total value.

Here's a possible allocation of items to agents that aims to balance the value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Allocated items: [0, 6]
   - Reason: These items have high values for Agent 0 (81 and 88).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Allocated items: [2]
   - Reason: Item 2 has a high value for Agent 1 (75).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Allocated items: [1, 3]
   - Reason: These items have high values for Agent 2 (99 and 90).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Allocated items: [7]
   - Reason: Item 7 has a high value for Agent 3 (85).

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Allocated items: [5]
   - Reason: Item 5 has a high value for Agent 4 (86).

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Allocated items: [4]
   - Reason: Item 4 has a reasonable value for Agent 5 (57).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly and that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
