Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4   5  35  81  74  57  55  64
1  74  36  36  75   3  69  54  10
2  16  75  84  43  91  14  69  71
3  42  71  18  20  15  21  75  54
4  77  12  37  74  19   1  67  27
5   4  24  97  30  30  98   8  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 4 24 97 30 30 98  8 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are assigned, we can aim to maximize the total value of the allocations. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items to the agent who values them the most without exceeding the number of items each agent should ideally receive.

Based on the given table, here is one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 5
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 6
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: No items

This distribution considers the highest individual valuations for the items while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": []
}
```
