Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  87  96  85   8  72  25  87
1  56  18  85  37  96  90  64  16
2  58  93  50  80  27  15  93  12
3  21  43   4   9  30  47  45  27
4   5  37  65  65  49  20  88  89
5  11  32  36  79  40   2  11  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuations. We can use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on the highest valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 and 6.
4. **Agent 3** has low valuations overall, so we will assign item 7 to them because of lower competition.
5. **Agent 4** has a relatively high valuation for item 7, but since it's already assigned, we won't allocate any items to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has a relatively balanced low valuation, and it might not get any items.

Let's assign the items according to this reasoning:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and all items are distributed among the agents.
