Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  97  50  61  73  72  86  55
1  70  97  69  87  71  48  91   1
2  77  86  35  65  25  41  74  95
3  94  13  75  47  81  97  12  56
4  54  88  34  58  11  86  71  63
5  91  37  74  17   1  99   9  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a balanced approach by considering the valuations of each agent for the items and distributing the items to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

- Assign items based on the highest value each agent places on them, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
- Attempt to balance the number of items assigned to each agent as evenly as possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 gets the items with the highest value: 0, 1
- Agent 1 gets the items they value highly: 6
- Agent 2 gets the items they value highly: 7
- Agent 3 gets the items they value highly: 5
- Agent 4 gets the items they value highly: 4
- Agent 5 gets the items they value highly: 2, 3

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```
