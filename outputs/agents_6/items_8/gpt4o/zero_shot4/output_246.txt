Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  14  27  73  80   1  44  17
1  21  34  82  26  25   2  51  58
2   0  66  72  20  13  90  44  19
3  70  72   4   7  34   2  69  75
4  77   8  17  17  54  98  37  48
5  94  99  15  94  47  53  22  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Let's first identify the highest valued items for each agent and allocate those items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 4 with a value of 80.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 2 with a value of 82.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 5 with a value of 90.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 1 with a value of 72.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 5 with a value of 98 (already taken), so next highest is 0 with a value of 77.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item is 1 with a value of 99 (already taken), so next highest is 0 with a value of 94 (already taken), so next is 3 with a value of 94.

Now, we allocate these highest-value items to each agent. This covers items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Next, allocate the remaining two items, 6 and 7, in a way that tries to balance the allocation based on remaining value preferences:

- Item 6: Highest remaining value for Agent 0 is 44.
- Item 7: Highest remaining value for Agent 3 is 75.

Now, let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 6
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 7
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Item 3

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly based on the highest valuation strategy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```
