Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  13  22  94  72  34  85  52
1  77  94  74  63  39  14  86  14
2   3  85  35  93  61  21  72  22
3  53  86  13  90  27  58   5  63
4   4  88  19  48  49  59  84  85
5  34  19  34  10  61  64   4  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Ensure that all items are distributed among the agents.

Let's apply this to the given table:

1. Item 0: Highest value is for agent 1 (77).
2. Item 1: Highest value is for agent 3 (86).
3. Item 2: Highest value is for agent 1 (74).
4. Item 3: Highest value is for agent 0 (94).
5. Item 4: Highest value is for agent 0 (72).
6. Item 5: Highest value is for agent 5 (64).
7. Item 6: Highest value is for agent 1 (86).
8. Item 7: Highest value is for agent 4 (85).

Now, let's ensure every agent has at least one item if possible and that exactly 8 items are allocated:

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Initially has items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Initially has items [0, 2, 6]
- Agent 2: Has no items
- Agent 3: Initially has item [1]
- Agent 4: Initially has item [7]
- Agent 5: Initially has item [5]

To ensure fairness, let's adjust the allocations so that every agent has at least one item:

1. Transfer item 4 from agent 0 to agent 2 to ensure agent 2 gets an item.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 6]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [5]

The adjusted fair allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
