Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  61  31   9  43  51   1  84
1  57  57  84  71  64   0  19  54
2  50  88  44  12  82  13  15  51
3  70  81  49   7  61  99  77  33
4  84  65  39  75  41  33  45  53
5  27  39  56  76  43  65  25  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we may aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a similar total valuation from their allocated items. While there are many potential ways to allocate the items, I'll provide one allocation that balances the total valuations as evenly as possible given the constraints.

Below is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives items: [0, 7]
2. Agent 1 receives items: [2]
3. Agent 2 receives items: [1, 4]
4. Agent 3 receives items: [5]
5. Agent 4 receives items: [3]
6. Agent 5 receives items: [6]

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Now, I will present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```
