Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  96  67  60  83  11  94  64
1   5  15  94  89  57  41   0  45
2  81  38  33  88  93  16  86  40
3  74  89  19  67  44  34   0  87
4  91  26  17   4  69  98  46  79
5  41  39  72  97  89  48  73  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 15 94 89 57 41  0 45]
 [81 38 33 88 93 16 86 40]
 [74 89 19 67 44 34  0 87]
 [91 26 17  4 69 98 46 79]
 [41 39 72 97 89 48 73 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. However, since there are only 8 items and 6 agents, two agents will receive only one item each.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items with high valuations for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Ensure Agent 1 gets at least one item they value.
3. **Agent 2**: Same strategy, focusing on high-valued items.
4. **Agent 3**: Ensure they receive a high-valued item.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign one of their higher-valued items.
6. **Agent 5**: Ensure Agent 5 gets a good item.

Based on the valuations, a potential allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 and Item 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 and Item 7
- **Agent 3**: Item 3
- **Agent 4**: Item 5
- **Agent 5**: Item 1

This allocation attempts to maximize satisfaction based on individual valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
