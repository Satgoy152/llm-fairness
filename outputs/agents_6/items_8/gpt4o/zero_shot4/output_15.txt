Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  55  77  39  24  73   0  17
1  89  76  78  29  76  84  10  19
2  35  90  63  66  19   7  48  70
3  51  35  80  30  34  34  55   9
4  37  49   8  20   9  60  53  46
5  99  28  90  91  89  10  12  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We have 6 agents and 8 items, so some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive only one.

Let's analyze the table and attempt to allocate items to agents to maximize their values:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (77) and Item 5 (73)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (89) and Item 5 (84)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (90) and Item 7 (70)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (80) and Item 6 (55)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (60) and Item 6 (53)

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (99) and Item 2 (90)

Based on these observations, let's allocate the items while ensuring a fair distribution:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 5 (highest value for 99)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for 90)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for 77)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 5 (highest value for 91)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (second-highest value for 76)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for 84)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 3 (highest value for 55)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for 70)

Given this allocation strategy, here's the corresponding JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, maximizing the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
