Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  59  44   2   3  77  14  42
1   0   2  36  96   7  27  65  49
2  57  59   1  54   7  64  43  98
3   2  82  41  58  80  83  97  93
4  78  88  48  84  63  98   3  47
5  41   5  32  49  56  88  75  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an approximately equal total valuation. The goal is to balance the total value each agent receives rather than allocating based solely on the highest individual item values.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign items that have relatively high valuations for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that are particularly valuable to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Consider high-value items for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items with high valuations for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items with high valuations for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate remaining items with moderate valuations.

Allocations:

- Agent 0: [0] (Value: 67)
- Agent 1: [3] (Value: 96)
- Agent 2: [7] (Value: 98)
- Agent 3: [5] (Value: 83)
- Agent 4: [1] (Value: 88)
- Agent 5: [2, 4, 6] (Values: 32, 56, 75)

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated equals 8.
