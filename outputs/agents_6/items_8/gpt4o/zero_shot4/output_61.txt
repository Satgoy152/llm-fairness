Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  90  20  42  70  48   3  63
1  59  41  49   3  27  24  21  72
2  59  73  40  83  16  65   0  51
3   4  59  97   7  86  14  67  40
4  15   7  93  44  69  63  29  92
5  46  32  31   8  31  92  53  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given the valuations, we'll try to allocate items to agents such that each agent gets the items they value the most while keeping the distribution balanced.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations each agent has for the items, and attempt to allocate based on maximizing these preferences.

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0 (92) and a relatively high value for item 1 (90).
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the most (72).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (83).
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the most (97).
5. Agent 4 values item 2 (93) and item 7 (92) the most.
6. Agent 5 values item 5 the most (92).

Based on these preferences, we can try to assign items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (as a second choice since Agent 4 can get item 7).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (as a second choice since Agent 2 can take it with zero value which is less contested).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and no items are left unallocated.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
