Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  95  29  50  92  12  38  18
1  93  92  49  42  58  44  38  26
2  45  94  61  15   4   9   0  71
3  51  56   5  42  18  96  88   7
4  79  34  73  31  77  69  59   7
5  42  40   7  12  89   2  48  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations. We'll try to balance the total value each agent receives by considering their preferences.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Start by sorting each agent's valuations to find which items they value the most.
2. Allocate items starting from the highest valued to try and equalize the perceived value among the agents.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values items: 1 (95), 4 (92), 0 (57), etc.
- Agent 1 values items: 0 (93), 1 (92), etc.
- Agent 2 values items: 1 (94), 2 (61), etc.
- Agent 3 values items: 5 (96), 6 (88), etc.
- Agent 4 values items: 0 (79), 4 (77), etc.
- Agent 5 values items: 7 (98), 4 (89), etc.

Based on the highest values, we can make the following allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (95)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (93)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (61)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (96)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (77)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 5 (98)
- For the remaining items 3 and 6, we distribute them to agents who have not yet received items or have lower total valuations.
  - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (50), as Agent 0 is left with a lower total value.
  - Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (88), as this adds to a substantial valuation for Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the distribution attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7]
}
```
