Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  65  13  69  52   0  18   1
1   3  17  44   4  20  69  88  91
2  80  91  75  50  22  92  28  37
3  63  56  14  97  31  91  44  94
4  44  95   6  19  58  45  92  24
5  36  98  63  74  14   6  42  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive only one item while others might receive two. Let's aim for a fair distribution based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent is considered.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most, but since agent 0 already took it, we allocate item 7.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the most, but since agent 4 already took it, we allocate item 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, with agent 5 receiving an extra item to ensure all 8 items are distributed.
