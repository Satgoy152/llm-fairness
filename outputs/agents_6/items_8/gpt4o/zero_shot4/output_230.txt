Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  37  86  91  24  73  40   1
1  70  67  75  40  85  58  97  12
2  81  53  10  47  58   8  99  89
3  94  82  83  42  14  90  34  67
4  22  53   9  85  29  16  89   2
5  43  85  31   7  82  14   7   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [43 85 31  7 82 14  7  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, one approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items based on their valuations. Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 3, value 94
   - Item 1: Agent 3, value 82
   - Item 2: Agent 0, value 86
   - Item 3: Agent 0, value 91
   - Item 4: Agent 1, value 85
   - Item 5: Agent 3, value 90
   - Item 6: Agent 2, value 99
   - Item 7: Agent 2, value 89

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuation:**
   - Agent 3 gets items 0, 1, and 5.
   - Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 gets item 4.
   - Agent 2 gets items 6 and 7.

3. **Check the allocation:**
   - Total items allocated: 8 (which matches the requirement).

4. **Ensure each agent is listed in the JSON, even if they receive no items.**

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 1, 5],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
