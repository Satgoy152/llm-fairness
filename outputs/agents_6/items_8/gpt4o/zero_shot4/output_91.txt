Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  93  17  29  29  57  96   5
1   1   6  74  87  25  43  58   8
2  85  23   0  68  27  84  38  96
3  74  23  23   6  33  25  29  16
4   4  95  78  25   4  76  84  84
5  90  88  82  96  99  21  44  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's valuation or by ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible. Let's attempt to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 96).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 87).
3. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 96).
4. Assign item 0 to agent 5 (value 90).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 5 (value 99).
6. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 95).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 84).
8. Assign item 2 to agent 5 (value 82).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned and attempts to give higher valued items to agents when possible. Note that some agents may not receive any items if their valuations are lower compared to the others.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
