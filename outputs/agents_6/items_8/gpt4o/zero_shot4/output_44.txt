Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  78  92  88  69  96  53  77
1  34  43  21  24  93  57  26  29
2  90  27  91  86  63  37  62  23
3  38  76  66  34  24  54  89  93
4   1  70  88  18  30  84   0  39
5  38  41   9  77  33  92  73  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (or as fairly as possible given the constraints). Given the valuation matrix, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (Value 96)
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (Value 93)
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (Value 90)
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 7 (Value 93)
5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (Value 88)
6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (Value 92)
   - Since Item 5 is already taken, choose the next highest unique item: Item 3 (Value 77)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 6. Going by the remaining highest unique valuations:

- **Agent 5** can take Item 6 (Value 73)
- **Agent 0** can take Item 1 (Value 78) 

So, the final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives the highest possible value given these constraints.
