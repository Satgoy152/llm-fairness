Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77   9  40  63  48   1  65  93
1  58  59  88   9  87  92  69  78
2  45  78  59  13  87  61  12  17
3  80  56  65  66  98  29  86  71
4  67  25  48  50   4  28  49  59
5  44  81  23  63   8  87   6  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, given there are 8 items and 6 agents.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Sort each agent's valuations for the items in descending order.
2. Assign the highest-valued available item to each agent in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 gets item 7 (value: 93)
2. Agent 1 gets item 5 (value: 92)
3. Agent 2 gets item 1 (value: 78)
4. Agent 3 gets item 4 (value: 98)
5. Agent 4 gets item 0 (value: 67)
6. Agent 5 gets item 3 (value: 63)

Now, two items remain unallocated: 2 and 6.

Let's assign these remaining items to agents with the next highest valuations:

7. Agent 1 gets item 6 (value: 69)
8. Agent 0 gets item 2 (value: 40)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.
