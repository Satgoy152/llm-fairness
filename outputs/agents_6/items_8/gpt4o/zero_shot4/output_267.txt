Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  56  30   3   4  87  25  22
1  58  60  60  58   2  35  92  71
2  82  62  12   5  82  65  48  80
3  61  83  86  14   7  63  12  94
4  68  67  32  64  55  40  19   7
5  46  31  45  59  58  52  60  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items such that each agent's preferences are respected as much as possible. Here's one way to do it:

1. Start by giving each agent their highest-valued item if possible.
2. Ensure that each item is allocated to only one agent.
3. If possible, balance the allocation so that each agent receives at least one item, but since there are more agents than items, this might not be possible for all.

Let's attempt an allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 6.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 0.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 7.
- Agent 4 can take item 1 (as it's the next highest unallocated value).
- Agent 5 can take item 2 (as it's the next highest unallocated value).

We are left with item 3 and 4, which we can allocate to the agents with fewer or no items, considering their next best preferences.

- Agent 0 can take item 4.
- Agent 5 can take item 3.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item where possible.
