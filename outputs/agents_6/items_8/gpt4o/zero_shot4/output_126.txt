Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  12  81  19   9  11  46  90
1  42  70  32  86  42  34  49   3
2  61  40  68  52  15  79  95  78
3  94  91  69  47  14  24  67  81
4   7  40  79  55  12   5  43  85
5  93  93  21  36  59   4  27  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [93 93 21 36 59  4 27 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 6 agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. One common approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and no agent receives more than necessary.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 (value of 94). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 5** has a high valuation for item 1 (value of 93). Assign item 1 to Agent 5.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 7 (value of 90). Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (value of 86). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6 (value of 95). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 2** also has a high valuation for item 5 (value of 79). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 4** highly values item 2 (value of 79). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
8. **Agent 3** has a reasonable valuation for item 4 (value of 14) and no other agent values it much higher. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
