Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  39  10  16  79  96  12  51
1  77  17  98  32  19   7  50  83
2   8  13  95   4  21  80  75  47
3  30  27  60  64  99  79  76   1
4  76  70  86  70  42  37  32  42
5  88  59   9  18  62  47  46  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are distributed. There are various ways to define "fairness," such as maximizing the minimum value each agent receives or trying to balance the total value each agent receives. For this allocation, I'll distribute the items while considering each agent's preferences as much as possible.

One potential approach is to assign the highest value item for each agent first and then proceed with the remaining items. However, since we have more items than agents, not all items can be allocated based on the highest value alone. Hence, I'll try to balance the allocation across agents to ensure fairness.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 7
- Agent 2 receives item 6
- Agent 3 receives item 4
- Agent 4 receives item 3
- Agent 5 receives item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed among the agents.
