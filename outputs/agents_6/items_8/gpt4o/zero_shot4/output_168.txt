Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  30  42  18  71  93  48   2
1  22   3  98  62  45  89  76  58
2  16  38  27  77  99  59  84  60
3  58  39  46  82  59  16  71  93
4  76  73  38  91  14  41  78  30
5  91  69  69  93  79   2  44  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. A common approach is to use an algorithm that balances the allocation by ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly, while also ensuring fairness across all agents.

Below is one possible allocation of the items:

1. Assign the item with the highest value for each agent, if possible.
2. Repeat the process while ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

Here's a proposed allocation for the agents:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 5 (Highest values: 94 and 93)
- Agent 1 gets items: 2 (Highest value: 98)
- Agent 2 gets items: 4, 6 (Highest values: 99 and 84)
- Agent 3 gets items: 7 (Highest value: 93)
- Agent 4 gets items: 3 (Highest value: 91)
- Agent 5 gets items: 1 (Highest value: 69)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly while distributing the items fairly.

}
