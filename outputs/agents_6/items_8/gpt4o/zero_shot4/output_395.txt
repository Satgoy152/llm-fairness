Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  31  31  41  10  44   7  93
1   4  21  29  13  97   4  76  56
2  60  83   2  38  14   0  99  23
3  56  94  66  40  91  90  95  34
4   4  65  37  34  22  13  69   4
5   6  47  86  76  87  52  39  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

First, let's analyze the preferences and attempt to distribute the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 7 the highest (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest (97).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the highest (99).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest (94).
5. **Agent 4**: Has no extremely high preferences, but item 6 is valued at 69.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 4 and item 2 the highest (87, 86).

Given this, let's try to allocate the items:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (since it is not highly valued by others).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 5 (Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 3).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0).

Now each agent has received items based on their highest preferences and all items are allocated fairly. Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents, considering their preferences as much as possible.
