Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  35  30  70  87  11   2  11
1  43  84   2  76   4  17  79  10
2  30  72  97  41  22   0  60  48
3  10  17  50  57  21  39  58   8
4  12  41  87  23  17  46  39  82
5  55  64  46  58  89  55  99  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Determine the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them those items.
2. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent's allocation is fair based on their preferences.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 87.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 84.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 97.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest at 58.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the highest at 82.
- Agent 5 values item 6 the highest at 99, but item 6 is already allocated to Agent 3. The next highest valued item for Agent 5 is item 4 at 89.

Re-adjusting allocations:
- Since item 4 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 5, give item 4 to Agent 5 and allocate a different item to Agent 0.

Here's the adjusted allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 3 (valuation of 70).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (valuation of 84).
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (valuation of 97).
- Agent 3 gets item 6 (valuation of 58).
- Agent 4 gets item 7 (valuation of 82).
- Agent 5 gets item 4 (valuation of 89).

Now, allocate the remaining items 0 and 5:
- Agent 0 can take item 5 (valuation of 11).
- Agent 1 can take item 0 (valuation of 43).

The allocations in JSON format are:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4]
}
```
