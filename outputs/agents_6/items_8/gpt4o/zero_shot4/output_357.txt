Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  62   9  96  15  27  58  25
1   3  51  12  28  22  23  76  41
2  90  51  91  55  88   8  59  24
3  15  78  99  91  21  74   7  30
4  88  33  26   2  77  63  40  61
5  55  83  74  12  18  57  25  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we will use a simple algorithm that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We'll ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Let's follow a basic greedy approach:

1. **Initialization**: Create a list of agents and items, each with their respective valuations.

2. **Allocation**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most unless that agent has already received an item and other agents haven't received any items yet.
   - Ensure that every agent receives at least one item if possible, with the constraint of having only 8 items in total.

3. **Balancing**:
   - If some agents have not received any items by the end of the allocation, reassign items from agents with more than one item to those with none, choosing items with the least valuation for the agent they are reassigned from.

Here is a possible allocation based on these rules:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and some agents get an extra item due to the limited number of items and the higher number of agents.
