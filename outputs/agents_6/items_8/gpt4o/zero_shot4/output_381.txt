Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  71  85  42   9  98  10   6
1  44  14  76  96  57  58   1  46
2  49  77   6  95  50   8  91  40
3  83   6  59  73  14  64  94  68
4  51  42  17  28  54  49  87  10
5  27  78  23   1  77  76  31  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items so that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest values for each agent while ensuring that exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

### Allocation Strategy
- Agent 0: Allocate items with high value to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Allocate items with high value to Agent 1.
- Continue this logic for other agents.

### Allocations
1. Agent 0 has high values for items 5 (98) and 2 (85).
2. Agent 1 has high values for items 3 (96) and 2 (76).
3. Agent 2 has high values for items 6 (91) and 3 (95).
4. Agent 3 has high values for items 6 (94) and 3 (73).
5. Agent 4 has a high value for item 6 (87).
6. Agent 5 has a high value for item 5 (76).

Distribute items to maximize total satisfaction:

- Agent 0: [5] (value 98)
- Agent 1: [3] (value 96)
- Agent 2: [6] (value 91)
- Agent 3: [2] (value 59)
- Agent 4: [4] (value 54)
- Agent 5: [1, 7] (values 78, 65)

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
```
