Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68   7  14  80  97  41  77   1
1  45  31   1  80  90  60  86  82
2  44  80  91  89  13  37  18  97
3  19  23  66  41  59  37  19  79
4  23  88  72  45   1  34  34  66
5  34   3  81  56  37  93  60  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a balanced approach where we look to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Given the valuations table, one approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest preferences or value, while also trying to ensure that agents receive a similar number of items if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (value 97).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (value 86).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most (value 97).
- Agent 3 values item 7 highly too, but since item 7 is already taken, we'll assign the next highest item, item 2 (value 66).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (value 88).
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most (value 93).

Now, we have to ensure all items are allocated:

- Item 0 is not allocated yet and is valued highest by Agent 0 (value 68).
- Item 3 is not allocated yet and is valued highest by Agent 0 (value 80).

Based on these considerations, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, and the allocations are aligned with the agents' highest valuations as much as possible.
