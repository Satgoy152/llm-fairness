Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  31  95  61  85  90  68  63
1  89  91  54  89  74  49   7  95
2  31  19  69  83   7  38  36   7
3  37   1  30  76   6  52  81  67
4  18  45   8  34  93  93  73  66
5  54  63  32  76  38  91  85  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent gets based on their preferences. Here, I'll attempt to assign items to agents to balance the overall valuation each agent receives.

Let's take a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 1** values item 1 and 7 highly, so let's assign those first.
2. **Agent 0** values item 5 highly, so we assign it.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly, so we assign it.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 highly, so we assign it.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 highly, so we assign it.
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 highly, so we assign it.
7. **Agent 0** also values item 2, so we assign it.

Now, let's see the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: 5, 2
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 7
- Agent 2 gets item: 3
- Agent 3 gets item: 6
- Agent 4 gets item: 4
- Agent 5 gets item: 0

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and we have assigned all 8 items. Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
