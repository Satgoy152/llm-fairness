Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  28  26  66  62  81  48  77
1  78  25  87  18  32  30  47   2
2  88  31  62  90  58  28   4   8
3  69  38  24  55  16  92   5   8
4  12  85  34  59  49  81  40  89
5  49  70  62  55  61  11  10  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's how we can distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the most (81), then item 7 (77).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (87).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (90).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most (92), but since item 5 is already taken, we look for the next highest.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 the most (89), but since item 7 is already taken, we look for the next highest.
6. **Agent 5** values item 1 and item 7 the most (70), but since item 7 is already taken, we look for the next highest.

Considering these preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items [5, 7]
- Agent 1 gets item [2]
- Agent 2 gets item [3]
- Agent 3 gets item [0]
- Agent 4 gets item [1]
- Agent 5 gets item [4]

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed to at least one agent, and each agent gets their highest valued remaining item. 

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```
