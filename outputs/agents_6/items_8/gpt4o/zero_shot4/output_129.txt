Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  79  92  88  13  51  15  99
1  38  99  89  17  71  79  68  88
2  72  82  54  89  86  33  28  67
3  94  68  37  40   4  99  10  89
4  85  14  34  43  50  76  21   3
5  69  38  23  57  94  57  47  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest valuation each agent has for any item and allocate that item if it is not already taken.
2. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Following this approach, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 7 (value 99).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 99).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 89).
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (value 99).
- Agent 4 gets item 0 (value 85).
- Agent 5 gets item 4 (value 94).
- The remaining items 2 and 6 can be allocated based on remaining preferences.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and each agent gets at least one item where possible, aiming for fairness based on their highest valuations.
