Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  28  15  60  39  25   5  94
1  43  23  82  60  23  16  80  24
2  40  46   6  36  90  14  52  84
3  68   4   8  87  20  31  62  43
4  27  54  84  64  53  92  74  90
5  59  31  32  65  10  82  34  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, I'll attempt to distribute the items based on their values and try to balance the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 7 highly (94). Allocate item 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 highly (82). Allocate item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 highly (90). Allocate item 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly (87). Allocate item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 highly (92). Allocate item 5.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 0 highly (59). Allocate item 0.

Now we have allocated 6 items, and we have 2 items remaining: 1 and 6.

7. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most (54).
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (80).

Allocate item 1 to Agent 4 and item 6 to Agent 1, as they value these items the most among the remaining choices.

The allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items in a manner that considers their valuations, while all 8 items are allocated.
