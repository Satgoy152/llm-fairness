Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  78  47  29  25  56  60  95
1  55  52  90  41  48  12  66  54
2  73  50  53  17  81  91  81  74
3  22  91  33  31  53  51  56  55
4  40  52  51   4   4  75  93  90
5  59  39  33  54   3  10  13  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 78 47 29 25 56 60 95]
 [55 52 90 41 48 12 66 54]
 [73 50 53 17 81 91 81 74]
 [22 91 33 31 53 51 56 55]
 [40 52 51  4  4 75 93 90]
 [59 39 33 54  3 10 13 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total value.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Values highest on item 7 (95).
- Agent 1: Values highest on item 2 (90).
- Agent 2: Values highest on item 5 (91).
- Agent 3: Values highest on item 1 (91).
- Agent 4: Values highest on item 6 (93).
- Agent 5: Values highest on item 0 (59).

Now, let's assign these items based on the highest valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:

1. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 5.

Now, we have the following items left unallocated: 3, 4.

Let's allocate these remaining items considering the next highest preferences, ensuring each agent has at least one item:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second highest value after item 2).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (next high value).

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```
