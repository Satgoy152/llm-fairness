Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  54  20  43  25  25  69  43
1  12   5  72  33  19  45  88  67
2  74  68   0  37  82  40  41  23
3  49   2  16  88  52  69   8  78
4  34   9  33  66  53  98  65   0
5  71  24  68  87  67  24  33   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets a similar total value from the items they receive. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll aim to balance the total value of items received by each agent as much as possible.

Here's a potential allocation that attempts to balance the value each agent receives:

1. Calculate the value each agent has for each item.
2. Allocate items to agents by maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- Agent 0 has high value for item 6.
- Agent 1 has high value for item 6.
- Agent 2 has high value for item 4.
- Agent 3 has high value for item 3.
- Agent 4 has high value for item 5.
- Agent 5 can take items that maximize the leftover value.

### Allocation:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 69).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 67).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 82).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 88).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (value 98).
- Assign items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 5 (values 71, 24, 68 respectively).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is fairly balanced based on their valuations.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives a fair distribution of items based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable total value from the items they receive.
