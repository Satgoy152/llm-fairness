Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  88  14  32  91  44  12  78
1  93  82   8   4  84  46  26  48
2  48  57  14  18  10  87  20  21
3  11  94  48  97   2  10  14  89
4  10  27  29  33  39  54  76  34
5  10  87  34  64  47  87  41  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation to ensure that each one gets a fair share based on their preferences. Given that we have 8 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive at least one item, but this isn't strictly necessary as long as the allocation is perceived as fair based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the data and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation on items 4 (91) and 1 (88)
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on items 0 (93) and 4 (84)
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation on item 5 (87)
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation on item 3 (97)
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation on item 6 (76)
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation on items 5 (87) and 7 (85)

Considering these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives item 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives item 6.
- Agent 5 receives items 7 and 4.
- Item 2 remains unallocated, so we should assign it to an agent with fewer items, such as Agent 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the high valuations across agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent either receives an item they value highly or a fair number of items, given the constraints.
