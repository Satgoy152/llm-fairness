Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75   9  96  40  86  47  96  13
1  85  80  55  80   5  23  92  30
2  76  47  61  22  90   1  77  46
3  95  63  11  64  45  78  61  76
4  97  15  93   5  91  61  85  40
5  37   5  15  50  69  66  86   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least some value from their allocated items while ensuring all 8 items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on highest individual valuations where possible.
2. Ensure no agent is left without an item if possible.
3. Aim for a balanced distribution considering the valuation table.

Following this strategy, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 3 can take item 5.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
- Agent 5 can take item 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
