Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  52  65  87  61  56  17  31
1  70  40   2   6  38  54  55  71
2  74   1  31  97   0  93  64  48
3  34  41  74  27  19  10  61  15
4  81  29  20   3  80  47  66  48
5  91  32  12  24  78  87  50  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a method such as maximizing the total value for each agent or distributing the items as evenly as possible based on their preferences. Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the distribution of items while considering each agent's high-value preferences:

1. Agent 0's highest value items are 3 and 2.
2. Agent 1's highest value items are 0 and 7.
3. Agent 2's highest value items are 3 and 5.
4. Agent 3's highest value items are 2 and 6.
5. Agent 4's highest value items are 0 and 4.
6. Agent 5's highest value items are 0 and 7.

Based on these preferences, we can attempt a fair allocation as follows:

- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [0, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent is satisfied with their highest value items wherever possible and that all items are distributed evenly. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```
