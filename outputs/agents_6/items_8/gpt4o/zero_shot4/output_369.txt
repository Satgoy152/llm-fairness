Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  37  66  42  55  79  82  76
1  80  46  49  17  53  96  65  61
2  16  30  70  90  72  73  80  56
3  25  17  66  87  43  45  74  43
4  93  59  69  68  88  12  28  74
5  38  76  23  19  44  31  46  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a relatively balanced total valuation from their allocated items. Given that we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive one item while others will receive two.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Distribute items to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items.

Based on the valuations provided, here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [69, 37, 66, 42, 55, 79, 82, 76]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [80, 46, 49, 17, 53, 96, 65, 61]
- Agent 2 values items as follows: [16, 30, 70, 90, 72, 73, 80, 56]
- Agent 3 values items as follows: [25, 17, 66, 87, 43, 45, 74, 43]
- Agent 4 values items as follows: [93, 59, 69, 68, 88, 12, 28, 74]
- Agent 5 values items as follows: [38, 76, 23, 19, 44, 31, 46, 33]

A fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0: [5] - Total valuation = 79
- Agent 1: [0] - Total valuation = 80
- Agent 2: [3] - Total valuation = 90
- Agent 3: [6] - Total valuation = 74
- Agent 4: [4, 7] - Total valuation = 88 + 74 = 162
- Agent 5: [1, 2] - Total valuation = 76 + 23 = 99

Each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution attempts to balance the total perceived value. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```
