Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  89  23  75  87  60  72  51
1  90  87  74  77  86  93  42  26
2  58  74  19  24   9  98  37  73
3  53  79  79  74  37  10  36  55
4  21  30  69  67  16  64  72  70
5  43  35  71   6  63  28  81  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction across all agents. One fair approach is to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and then distribute the remaining based on the highest valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 1, which has a high valuation of 89 for this agent.
- Agent 1: Allocate item 5, since it has the highest valuation for this agent at 93.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 6, as it has the highest value of 98 for this agent.
- Agent 3: Allocate item 2, as it has a high valuation of 79 for this agent.
- Agent 4: Allocate item 7, which has a high valuation of 70 for this agent.
- Agent 5: Allocate item 4, which has a decent valuation of 63 for this agent.

For the remaining items, we need to distribute them to the agents based on their highest valuations among the unallocated items:

- Item 0 can be given to agent 1, as agent 1 values it at 90, which is the highest among all agents for this item.
- Item 3 can be given to agent 0, as agent 0 values it at 75, which is the highest among all agents for this item.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4]
}
```
