Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  66  48  86  76  98  13   9
1  95  31  50  73  18  22  80  61
2  32  40  39  93  30   7  17  14
3  42  48   2  62  97  16  19  20
4  94  21  74  27  37  60  95  62
5  32  82  50  91  84  42  62  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated in total. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent has for any item that hasn't been allocated yet, aiming for an equitable distribution based on preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5 (value 98).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (value 95).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3 (value 93).
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 4 (value 97).
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 6 (value 95).
6. Agent 5 has the highest value for item 1 (value 82).

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and need to allocate 2 more items to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. We can distribute the remaining items based on the next highest values among unallocated items:

7. Agent 0 also has a high value for item 3 (value 86), but item 3 is already allocated. The next available high-value item for Agent 0 is item 4 (value 76).
8. Agent 1 can receive item 7 (value 61).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed according to the agents' highest valuations.
