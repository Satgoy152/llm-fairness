Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  78  86  19  21  58  94  68
1  64  36  17  59  20  28  56  30
2  89  55  50  15  35  38  35  45
3  32  66  42  54  92  61  98  56
4  23  39  99   9  90  87  50  31
5  61  76   4  36  97  60  34  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. We will iterate through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 99, which is the highest.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 78, which is the highest.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it at 99, which is the highest.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 59, which is the highest.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 5 values it at 97, which is the highest.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it at 87, which is the highest.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it at 98, which is the highest.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 68, which is the highest.

Now, we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed to the agents based on their highest valuations.
