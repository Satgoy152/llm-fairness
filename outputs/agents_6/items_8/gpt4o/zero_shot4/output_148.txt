Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  56  96  51  58  73  73  34
1   3  74   1  36   1  83   3  92
2  49  18  41  38  26  21  37  97
3  35  21  89  66  26  61   1  24
4  52  80  47   7  69  96   8  45
5  75   5  27  19  99  23  38  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[15 56 96 51 58 73 73 34]
 [ 3 74  1 36  1 83  3 92]
 [49 18 41 38 26 21 37 97]
 [35 21 89 66 26 61  1 24]
 [52 80 47  7 69 96  8 45]
 [75  5 27 19 99 23 38 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives, considering the preferences shown in the valuation table. Here is a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's allocate items that are most valuable to Agent 0.
   - Items: 0, 3 (Valuation: 15 + 51 = 66)

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that are highly valued by Agent 1.
   - Items: 1, 7 (Valuation: 74 + 92 = 166)

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 finds valuable.
   - Items: 2 (Valuation: 41)

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that Agent 3 values.
   - Items: 6 (Valuation: 1)

5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items that are valuable to Agent 4.
   - Items: 5 (Valuation: 96)

6. **Agent 5**: Allocate items that Agent 5 finds valuable.
   - Items: 4 (Valuation: 99)

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
