Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  46  20  80  76  96  47   7
1  14  43  76  13  14  14  77  32
2  32  91  88  69  24   0  83  13
3   9  26  48   0  67  43  77  43
4  22  46   6  97  63   7  70  72
5  54  12  10   5   1  34  70  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If two agents value an item equally, choose one based on who has fewer items allocated so far or randomly if they have the same count.

Here's the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (value 79)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (value 91)
- Item 2: Agent 2 (value 88)
- Item 3: Agent 4 (value 97)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 76)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 96)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (value 77)
- Item 7: Agent 4 (value 72)

Now, let's format the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 7],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations, while all items are allocated.
