Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70   9  40  81   3  49  95  46
1  35  90  49  73  94  80  33  47
2  40  23  35  76  57  57  70  98
3  15  80  94  21  71  52   7  72
4  99  32  25   1  14  11  32  76
5   6  60  17  57  28  63  47  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring all items are allocated. A simple approach could involve iteratively assigning each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0 has the highest value of 99 for agent 4.
2. Item 1 has the highest value of 90 for agent 1.
3. Item 2 has the highest value of 94 for agent 3.
4. Item 3 has the highest value of 81 for agent 0.
5. Item 4 has the highest value of 94 for agent 1.
6. Item 5 has the highest value of 63 for agent 5.
7. Item 6 has the highest value of 95 for agent 0.
8. Item 7 has the highest value of 98 for agent 2.

Now, we check to ensure that each agent is represented, and make any adjustments if necessary. 

After ensuring a fair distribution, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.
