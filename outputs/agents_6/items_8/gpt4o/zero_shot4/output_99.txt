Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  64  18  80   0   8  84  59
1  57   3  99  93  27  72  53  58
2   9   6  28  87  50  98  78  19
3  52  69  40  14  43  41   6  29
4  44  33  40  55  82  81  60  72
5  86   5  21  76  22  71  68  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share of their most valued items. Given there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents may receive more than one item, while others may receive none.

Let's try to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We'll start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that the allocation remains fair and balanced.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 5 values item 0 the most at 86.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 5.

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most at 69.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 99.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 93.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 4 values item 4 the most at 82.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Item 5**:  
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 98.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

7. **Item 6**:  
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 84.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

8. **Item 7**:  
   - Agent 4 values item 7 the most at 72.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

### Final Allocation:
The allocation is done in such a way that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the agents have been allocated items based on their highest valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it most, while distributing the total number of items fairly among the agents.
