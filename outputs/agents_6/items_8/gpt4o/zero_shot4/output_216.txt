Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  16  38  28  88  29  28  57
1  65  53  27  48  39  31  81  86
2  66  54  50  83  69  81   2  60
3  11  63  86  77   0  45  22  37
4  29  19  43  58  15  20  70  11
5  86  58  47  40  23  12  35  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness. This can be approached in several ways, including maximizing the overall utility, ensuring envy-freeness, or using algorithms like the round-robin method or the max-min fair allocation.

Here, I will attempt a simple allocation focusing on distributing items based on the highest individual valuations for simplicity:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (88).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7 (86).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (81).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 (86).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 6 (70).
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 0 (86).

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and agents 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 each have one item allocated. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- The next highest unallocated item is item 3, which agent 2 values at 83.
- The final unallocated item is item 1, which agent 3 values at 63.

Letâ€™s allocate these remaining items:

- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total of 8 items are distributed among the agents.
