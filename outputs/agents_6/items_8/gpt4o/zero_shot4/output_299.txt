Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  42  35  48  88  59  32  27
1  23  84   4  67  69  31  24  77
2  19  49  74  26  38  94  66  78
3   8  26  86  56   2  92  33  63
4   4   5  36  60  70  61  76  53
5   5  43  42  66  91  17  83  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Given the valuations, a reasonable approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (88).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (84).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 5 (94).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 2 (86).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 6 (76).
6. Agent 5 highly values item 3 (66).

We now have 2 more items to allocate:

7. Agent 0 also values item 0 highly (80).
8. Agent 1 also values item 7 highly (77).

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
