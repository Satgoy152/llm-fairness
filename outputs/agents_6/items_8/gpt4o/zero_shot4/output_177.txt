Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  78  80  84  91  70   9  18
1  58  61  32  35  34  48  67   7
2  14  92  84  86  36  24  13  27
3   7  29  45  32  10   2   4   0
4  55  20  52   4  84  54  81  17
5  66  37  86  72  94  72  51  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a method that considers each agent's valuation of the items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that we have 8 items and 6 agents, each agent can receive at least one item, with two agents receiving an additional item. We'll allocate based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the provided valuations, taking care to distribute the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for item 4. We'll assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 relatively highly. We'll assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1. We'll assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a moderately high valuation for item 2. We'll assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 6. We'll assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has high valuations for items 5 and 7. We'll assign item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (3 and 7) to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items:

7. **Agent 2** also has a high valuation for item 3, so we'll assign item 3 to Agent 2.
8. **Agent 5** can take the remaining item 7, as they also have a decent valuation for it.

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```
