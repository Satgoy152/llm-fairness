Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  28   0  58  78  73  98  60
1  30  41  52  37  30  91  25  97
2  78  64   2  13  88  62  94  35
3  65  11  46  78  79  94   3  60
4   9  38  32  11   3  79  73  38
5  60  55   1  30   4  48  69  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 8 items are allocated in total. This can be considered a variant of the "fair division" problem.

To achieve this, one approach is to use a "greedy" allocation strategy, where we iteratively assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest value by agent 2 (78)
2. Item 1: Highest value by agent 2 (64)
3. Item 2: Highest value by agent 1 (52)
4. Item 3: Highest value by agent 3 (78)
5. Item 4: Highest value by agent 2 (88)
6. Item 5: Highest value by agent 1 (91)
7. Item 6: Highest value by agent 0 (98)
8. Item 7: Highest value by agent 1 (97)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets a fair number of items:

- Agent 0 receives item 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 5, and 7.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives no items.
- Agent 5 receives no items.

Based on the above allocation, below is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
