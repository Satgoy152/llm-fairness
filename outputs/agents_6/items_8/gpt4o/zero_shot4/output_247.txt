Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  67  67  33  20  29  46  10
1  71  86  15  44  43  63  95  22
2  62  13  38   5  37  97  64  54
3  70   0   3  48  32  24  34  38
4  13  59   8  50  45  15  72  60
5  77  32  58  61   4  26  84  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 6 agents, we can consider a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 6, so we assign item 6 to agent 1.
2. Agent 2 highly values item 5, so we assign item 5 to agent 2.
3. Agent 0 highly values item 1, so we assign item 1 to agent 0.
4. Agent 5 highly values item 0, so we assign item 0 to agent 5.
5. Agent 3 highly values item 3, so we assign item 3 to agent 3.
6. Agent 4 highly values item 7, so we assign item 7 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 6 out of 8 items, with items 2 and 4 remaining. To allocate these remaining items:

7. Agent 5 has the next highest valuation for item 2, so we assign item 2 to agent 5.
8. Agent 4 has the next highest valuation for item 4, so we assign item 4 to agent 4.

With this strategy, each agent gets allocations based on their high valuations, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7, 4],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```
