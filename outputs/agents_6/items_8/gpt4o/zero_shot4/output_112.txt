Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  22  36  54   8  53  19  33
1  47  99  15   9  78  28   5  61
2  52  37  37   1  84  79  98  81
3  60  19  64  61  80  15  17  87
4  83  31  73  59  63  93  31  99
5  38  28  71  41  15  30   1  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that the overall valuation for each agent is balanced. One approach is to iteratively assign the highest valued item available to an agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 4 highly values item 7 (value 99), so we allocate it to Agent 4.
2. Agent 2 highly values item 6 (value 98), so we allocate it to Agent 2.
3. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value 99), so we allocate it to Agent 1.
4. Agent 4 also values item 5 highly (value 93), so we allocate it to Agent 4.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 (value 83), so we allocate it to Agent 4.
6. Agent 2 values item 4 (value 84), so we allocate it to Agent 2.
7. Agent 3 values item 3 (value 61), so we allocate it to Agent 3.
8. Agent 0 values item 2 (value 36), so we allocate it to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 5, 7],
    "5": []
}
```
