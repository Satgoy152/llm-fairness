Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  46  54  69  38   3  38  24
1  61  32  60  43  65  45  67  56
2  44  10  53  69   6   3  23   4
3  33  85  24  68  24  90  97  57
4  43  13  62  24  59   6  11  53
5   5   2  12  66  55  25  82  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, as we have 6 agents and 8 items. We will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for the items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no agent receives more than two items since there are 8 items and 6 agents.

The allocation process could look like this:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (88).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (67).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (69).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (97), but since it's already taken, assign their second highest item, item 5 (90).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (62).
- Agent 5 values item 6 the highest (82), but since it's already taken, assign their second highest item, item 7 (74).

Now, we have 2 items left: items 1 and 4. Distribute them among the agents so that the load is balanced:

- Agent 3 can take item 1 (85).
- Agent 1 can take item 4 (65).

Here is a possible allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items while considering the agents' preferences.
