Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  94  19  16  28  77  69  17
1  60  38  64  85  58  55  39   2
2  70  44  52  76  29  99  31  73
3  32  69   8  39  60  79  32  97
4  39  25  76  20  14  36  97  46
5  73  31  29  51  85  16  97  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should attempt to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their own valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations, here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highest, so give item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 highest, so give item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highest, so give item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 highest, so give item 7 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highest, so give item 6 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 highest, so give item 4 to Agent 5.
7. Item 1 and item 2 need to be allocated to ensure every agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. 

Since Agent 4 and Agent 5 have the lowest total valuation after the above allocation, distribute the remaining items to them:

- Give item 1 to Agent 4.
- Give item 2 to Agent 5.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6, 1],
    "5": [4, 2]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.
