Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  69  33  21  22  88  30  29
1  35  52  10  12  65  46  34  90
2  15  29  47  96  89  95  13  23
3  18  12  70   5  39  38   1  17
4  69  22  26  79  80  19  45  52
5  39  25   9  27  75  52  47   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the sum total of items allocated is exactly 8, as there are 8 items in total. One common approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the sum of valuations for the items allocated to each agent. However, without specific fairness criteria (like maximizing total valuation or ensuring envy-freeness), a balanced allocation is subjective. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 5 (value 88), item 1 (value 69), and item 0 (value 12). This gives agent 0 a strong overall allocation based on their high valuation for item 5.
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 7 (value 90). Agent 1 highly values item 7.
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 3 (value 96). Agent 2 highly values item 3.
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 2 (value 70). Agent 3 highly values item 2.
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 4 (value 80). Agent 4 highly values item 4.
6. Agent 5: Allocate item 6 (value 47). 

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item if they highly value it, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
