Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  97  45   3  79   4  28  70
1  15   1  49  46  96  22  97  23
2  18  48  65  40  78  56  56  18
3  11  33  14  90  32  30  86  16
4  58  12  72  47   7   2  57  50
5  51   1  59  23  73  63  19  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0: Allocate the item with the highest valuation for agent 0.
2. Agent 1: Allocate the item with the highest valuation for agent 1.
3. Continue this process for each agent, while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Below is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 97.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most with a valuation of 97.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 65.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 90.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 72, but since item 2 is already taken, we allocate the next highest valued item which is item 0 with a valuation of 58.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most with a valuation of 63.
- Remaining items (items 4 and 7) can be allocated to agents with the next highest valuations for fairness.

Here's a potential allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 4, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are assigned in a way that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences. Note, however, that there are multiple ways to allocate items fairly, and the above is just one example.
