Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  81  63  98   1  63  61   4
1  56  60  89  61  91  53  69  43
2  26  15  54  35  76  17  49  10
3  75   1  50  43  78  91  58  84
4  82   7  48  56  69  65  12  72
5  45  91  49  51  52  25  36  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and exactly 8 items in total are allocated. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate based on maximizing each agent's value:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [8, 81, 63, 98, 1, 63, 61, 4]
   - Highest value items: 3 (98)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [56, 60, 89, 61, 91, 53, 69, 43]
   - Highest value items: 4 (91)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [26, 15, 54, 35, 76, 17, 49, 10]
   - Highest value items: 4 (76)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [75, 1, 50, 43, 78, 91, 58, 84]
   - Highest value items: 5 (91)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values: [82, 7, 48, 56, 69, 65, 12, 72]
   - Highest value items: 0 (82)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Values: [45, 91, 49, 51, 52, 25, 36, 87]
   - Highest value items: 1 (91)

Now allocate based on these preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and 8 items are given in total:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 0.
- Agent 5 gets item 1.

Now we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.
To ensure fairness, we should allocate the remaining items to agents with relatively lower total current value.

- Remaining items: [2, 7]
  - Agent 5 gets item 7 (since they have the next highest value for an unallocated item, 87).
  - Agent 4 gets item 2 (as they are next with relatively low total current value).

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
```
