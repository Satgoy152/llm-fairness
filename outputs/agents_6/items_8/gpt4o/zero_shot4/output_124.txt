Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  23  49   1  16  26   6  42
1   8  47  85  53  22  48  72  40
2  72  54   9  23  12  69  47  26
3  82  18  22  35  53  55  18  24
4   0  26  31  82  56  41  50   0
5  23  63  36  42  80  13  74  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing the items in a manner that maximizes each agent's total valuation. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (82).
2. Item 1: Agent 5 values it the most (63).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (85).
4. Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most (82).
5. Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most (80).
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (69).
7. Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (74).
8. Item 7: Agent 5 values it the most (89).

Now, based on this allocation approach, we can organize the items for each agent:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [1, 4, 6, 7]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated once and all agents are considered. Here's the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 4, 6, 7]
}
```
