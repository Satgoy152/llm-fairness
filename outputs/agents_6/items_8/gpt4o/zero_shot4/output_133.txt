Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  81  54   5  72  85  57  32
1  13  68  37  34  43  67  56  77
2  30  86  51  34  58  27  15  29
3  64  42  60  87   7  26  55  41
4  49  73  90  96  85  72   7  51
5  30  29  82  13  45  48  53  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 (value 85).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items 7 (value 77) and 1 (value 68).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (value 30).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (value 87).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items 2 (value 90) and 4 (value 85).
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 6 (value 53).

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated while considering the values perceived by each agent.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
