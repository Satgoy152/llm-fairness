Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  43  71  25  44  99  65  36
1   5  63  32  75  96  62  56  46
2  26   5  13  86  18  25  26  71
3  89  14  56  94  17  74  42  80
4  29  15  62  29   2  48  74  86
5   2  76  54  45  19  45   6  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, with a total of 8 items distributed among the agents. One way to approach this is by considering the highest value each agent assigns to the items and trying to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation:

Agent 0 values item 5 highly (99), while Agent 1 values item 4 highly (96). Agent 3 highly values item 3 (94). We can allocate based on these high value preferences and try to distribute evenly.

Allocation:

- Agent 0: [5] (highest value item)
- Agent 1: [1, 4] (next highest value items)
- Agent 2: [7] (high value)
- Agent 3: [3] (highest value item)
- Agent 4: [6] (high value)
- Agent 5: [2, 0] (remaining items with decent value)

This distribution attempts to ensure each agent receives items with values they appreciate while distributing all 8 items. 

The json format for the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and every agent gets at least one item.
