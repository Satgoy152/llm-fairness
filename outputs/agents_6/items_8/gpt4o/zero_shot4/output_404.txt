Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17   9  27  77  74   7   3  49
1  21   3  70  31  26  47  16  99
2  22  80  58  63  99  78  74  18
3  94  30  31  55  14  79  98  50
4  61  93  81  34   1  10   4   5
5  80  16   5  83  15  49  51  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items so that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to achieve this, considering each agent should get at least one item due to the number of items matching the number of agents:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Distribute items to agents to balance the total valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's perform these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations

- Agent 0: 17 + 9 + 27 + 77 + 74 + 7 + 3 + 49 = 263
- Agent 1: 21 + 3 + 70 + 31 + 26 + 47 + 16 + 99 = 313
- Agent 2: 22 + 80 + 58 + 63 + 99 + 78 + 74 + 18 = 492
- Agent 3: 94 + 30 + 31 + 55 + 14 + 79 + 98 + 50 = 451
- Agent 4: 61 + 93 + 81 + 34 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 5 = 289
- Agent 5: 80 + 16 + 5 + 83 + 15 + 49 + 51 + 68 = 367

### Step 2: Allocate Items

Allocate items to agents based on their preferences (higher valuation) and try to balance the total valuation among all agents.

### Allocation
- Agent 0: [3, 4] - Total valuation = 77 + 74 = 151
- Agent 1: [7] - Total valuation = 99
- Agent 2: [2, 6] - Total valuation = 58 + 74 = 132
- Agent 3: [0] - Total valuation = 94
- Agent 4: [1] - Total valuation = 93
- Agent 5: [5] - Total valuation = 49

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed to achieve a fair balance of total valuations.

### JSON Format Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```
