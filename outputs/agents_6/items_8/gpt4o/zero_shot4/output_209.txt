Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  44  73  80  47  83  48  57
1  32  81  18   6  45  88  81  28
2  25  25  42  57  83  82  93   5
3  83  50   9  80  48  57  76  14
4  87  40  35  98  53  21  73   5
5  39  33  31  53  44  87  67  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations given in the table and try to distribute items such that the overall satisfaction or value for each agent is reasonably balanced. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 5 the most (83). Assign item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 highly as well (88), but since it's taken, the next highest is item 1 (81). Assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 6 (93). Assign item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 (83). Assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (98). Assign item 3 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 5, but since it's taken, the next highest is item 5 (87). Assign item 5 to agent 5. Since item 5 is already taken, we will assign item 4 (44) to agent 5.
7. **Remaining Items**: We have items 2 and 7 left to allocate. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (35) and item 7 to agent 1 (28) as they have relatively higher valuations for these items.

Hereâ€™s how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 2],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while all items are distributed.
