Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  71  47  81  46  48  46   0
1  14  38  50  57  43  39  43  48
2  94  88  12  16   9  50  90  31
3  85  91  62  75  36   0  51  73
4   5  42  78  78  75  43   0  30
5  36  90  25  36  98  81  22  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and strive to allocate the items such that the overall satisfaction is maximized or balanced. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has a relatively high value for item 3 (81).
- Agent 1 has a reasonable value for item 7 (48) and item 2 (50).
- Agent 2 values item 0 (94) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 1 (91) highly.
- Agent 4 values item 4 (75) highly.
- Agent 5 values item 5 (81) highly.

Here's a fair allocation based on these observations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, and all 8 items are allocated.
