Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  36  49  90  47  86  18  68
1   4   0  94  30  11  28  64  96
2  85  54  55  88  80  16   3  61
3  55  48  77  73  37  10   3  57
4  34  36  82  65  68  83  43  29
5  40  36  85  24  91  72  78  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [40 36 85 24 91 72 78 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest value for each item across all agents, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and the total allocation equals 8 items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 2 (85).
2. Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 2 (54).
3. Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 1 (94).
4. Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 0 (90).
5. Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 5 (91).
6. Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 0 (86).
7. Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 5 (78).
8. Item 7: Highest value is by Agent 1 (96).

Based on this approach, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets items [3, 5].
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 7].
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 1].
- Agent 3 gets no items.
- Agent 4 gets no items.
- Agent 5 gets items [4, 6].

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```
