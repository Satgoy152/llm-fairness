Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  38  55  33  17  40  46  62
1   2  10  87  43  22  31  76  27
2  47  21  51  83  72   2  44  36
3  26  68  39  12  16  16  86  34
4  62  23  19  29  44  24  25  41
5  62  47  85   1  54  42  12   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in such a way that reflects the preferences of the agents as best as possible while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Considering the valuations given, let's make the allocations based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness in distribution:

1. Identify the highest value item for each agent.
2. Allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction while avoiding giving one agent too many items.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 4, 7
- Agent 5: Item 5

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that reflects the agents' preferences and utilizes all available items.
