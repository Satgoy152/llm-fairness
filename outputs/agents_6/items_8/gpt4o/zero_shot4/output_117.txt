Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  78   5  15  22  29  81  21
1  45  93   0  64  99  90  12  10
2  94  49  34  13  22  12  40  46
3  13   4  64  62  32  41  35  83
4  87  37  87  73  55  56  38  43
5  88  17  84  79  38  47  41  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations. However, each agent must receive at least one item, and the total number of items must equal 8.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 6 (value of 81).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 4 (value of 99).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 0 (value of 94).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 7 (value of 83).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (value of 87).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation is for item 5 (value of 47).

Now, all agents have one item each, and two items remain to be allocated. The remaining items are 1 and 3.

Let's allocate the remaining two items by considering the next highest valuations for items 1 and 3:

- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value of 93), but Agent 1 already has an item. The second-highest valuation is by Agent 0 (value of 78). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 5 (value of 79).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
