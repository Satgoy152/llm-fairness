Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  20  64  96  41  98  67  77
1  80  23   5  14  45  56   7  49
2  79  15  17   7  76  59   4  71
3  97   9  94  97  87  47   4   2
4  52  29  76   7  16   3  32  15
5  40  31  91  32  91  17  14  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We will try to distribute the items as evenly and efficiently as possible, also considering agents' preferences.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 5 (98), so we allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (80), so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 4 (76), so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3 (97), so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 2 (76), so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 6 (91), so we allocate item 6 to agent 5.

Now, the remaining items are 1 and 7, and we need to allocate them considering fairness:

7. Item 1 can be allocated to agent 0, who values it at 20 (this is one of the higher valuations among remaining items for any agent).
8. Item 7 can be allocated to agent 0, who values it at 77, which is a higher valuation compared to other agents.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets a share of the items while trying to maximize their individual valuations.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6]
}
```
