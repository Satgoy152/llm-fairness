Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  93  31  68  38  11  41  47
1  91  47  20  15  95  72  91  98
2  83  52  72  13  78  37  33  26
3   9  31  61  54  62  90  15  85
4  34  15  39  77  84  46  43  16
5  65  32  14  93  99  99   9  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given that we have 8 items and 6 agents, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item if possible, but some will end up with more than others due to the total number of items being less than the number of agents multiplied by two.

Let's allocate the items based on the preferences and valuations provided:

1. First, identify the item with the highest value for each agent and allocate it if it's not already taken.
2. Allocate remaining items to agents with the next highest valuations.

Following this approach:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (93), let's allocate it to them.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most (98), let's allocate it to them.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (72), let's allocate it to them.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (90), let's allocate it to them.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (84), let's allocate it to them.
- Agent 5 values item 4 and 5 the most (99), but since item 4 is already taken, allocate item 3 to them with next highest value (93).

Now we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items:

- Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 as their next highest preference (91).
- Item 6: Allocate to Agent 0 as their next highest preference (41).

Now, each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
