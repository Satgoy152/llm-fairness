Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  97  22  30  36  40  84  75
1  64  56  31  21  83  59  28  24
2  96   1  12  87  87  83  24  57
3  14  54  96  55  87  34  72  96
4   6  12  47  53  69  72   0  64
5  93  49  59  22  47  91  84  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a distribution that maximizes each agent's total valuation, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (97) - Highest value for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (83) - Highest value for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (96) - Highest value for agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 2 (96) - Highest value for agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 5 (72) - Highest value for agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 6 (84) - One of the highest values for agent 5.
7. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 7 (96) - Another high value for agent 3.
8. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 3 (22) - Remaining item for agent 5.

This allocation distributes the items based on high valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
