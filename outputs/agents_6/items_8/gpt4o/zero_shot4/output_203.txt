Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  33  55  79  98  88  87  36
1  16  18  45  61  94  11  86  15
2  87  76  62  79  55   7  76  40
3  23  31  45  35  40  31  35  14
4  43  60   1   5  55  62  75  69
5  95  76  67  42  26  91  83  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method to try to maximize the total valuation of the items for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (since there are 6 agents and 8 items, this is possible). Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item**: Sum the values each agent assigns to each item. This gives us an idea of which items are generally more valuable.

2. **Assign Items to Agents**: Start by assigning items that have the highest value for an agent in order to maximize overall satisfaction. Ensure that every agent gets at least one item.

3. **Rebalance as Needed**: If any agent ends up with more than one item while another has none, redistribute to ensure fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highly (98) and item 5 (88).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 4 highly (94).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 0 highly (87).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 2 highly (45).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 5 highly (62).
- **Agent 5**: Values item 0 highly (95), item 5 (91).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value = 98).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5 (value = 91).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 87).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value = 45).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value = 86).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (value = 69).

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value = 79).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 5 (value = 76).

This way, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and we've used all 8 items.
