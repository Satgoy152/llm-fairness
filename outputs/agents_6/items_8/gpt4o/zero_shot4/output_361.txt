Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  10   6   4  68  66  79  34
1   8  98  90  74  47  89  12  88
2  80  11  10  77  43  96  93  54
3  33  11  52  32  83  69  70  47
4  11  58  22   1  30  56  50   1
5  98  92  88   5  47  95  30  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item is assigned to the agent that derives the most value from it.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most with a valuation of 98.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with a valuation of 98.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most with a valuation of 90.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most with a valuation of 77.
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most with a valuation of 83.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most with a valuation of 96.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most with a valuation of 93.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most with a valuation of 88.

Now, let's format the allocation in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 7],
    "2": [3, 5, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring a fair allocation based on the provided valuations.
