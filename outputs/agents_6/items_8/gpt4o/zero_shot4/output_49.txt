Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  28   4  29  26  68  55  93
1  98  39  56  44  48   6  66  24
2  22  38  93  24  13  66  35  33
3  71  29  25  46   4  39  60  89
4  20  41  26  83  25  92  57  29
5  68  85  53   7  86  20  23  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we should aim to consider each agent's preferences while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's start by examining the highest value each agent assigns to items and try to allocate items based on these preferences:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (value of 98).
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (value of 98). However, since agent 0 also values item 0 highly, let's consider their next highest, which is item 2 (value of 56).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (value of 93).
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 the highest (value of 89).
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the highest (value of 92).
6. **Agent 5** values item 1 the highest (value of 85).

Given these preferences, we can now allocate items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6 (next highest value not already allocated is 66).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 7.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 5.
- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 1.

Items 3 and 4 remain unallocated, so let's find agents who have not yet received their highly valued items:

- **Agent 1** has a good value on item 3 (value of 44, their third-highest).
- **Agent 5** values item 4 somewhat (value of 86, their second-highest).

Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences and ensures that all items are allocated.
