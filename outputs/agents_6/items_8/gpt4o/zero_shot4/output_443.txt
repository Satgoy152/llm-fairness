Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  93  59  23  29  55  26  95
1  58   2  73   1  50   5  44  94
2  18  26  64  72  60  32  42   9
3   9  58  28  47  49  16  17  35
4  15  71  21  39  49  28  86  32
5  38  89  80   3  52  95  63  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Since there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will inevitably receive more than one item.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Begin by identifying the highest valuation for each agent and assign that item to the respective agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item first.
2. Allocate the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 7 (95).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 7 (94); next highest is item 2 (73).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3 (72).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 1 (58).
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 6 (86).
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 5 (95).

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- Agent 0 already has item 7, we can give them item 1, their next highest (93).
- Agent 1 has item 2, we can give them item 4 (50).

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

Note: This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the valuation for each agent where possible.
