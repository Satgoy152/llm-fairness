Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  70  20  71  34  73   6  31
1  46  51  85  53  55  46  38  10
2  77   1  26  85  89   2  11  47
3  28   6  32  81  10  43  12  32
4  48   9  69  18  19  14  26  74
5  50  92  61  80  91  24  37  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction or value obtained by each agent. A common approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 can be allocated item 7, which is valued moderately.
- Agent 4 can be allocated item 6, as it has a moderate valuation for them.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 1.

Given this analysis, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is distributed to maximize the total perceived value while ensuring each agent is considered.
