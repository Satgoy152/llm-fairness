Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  46   8  86  64  21  19  68
1  85  88  42  70  18  45   6  25
2  68  19  15  16  36  86   5  90
3  14  83  19  47  85   6  16   5
4  34  71   0  62  63  97  34   8
5  14  66  65  15  81  85  56  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's start by analyzing the given valuations and proceed to allocate the items.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [22, 46, 8, 86, 64, 21, 19, 68]
- Agent 1: [85, 88, 42, 70, 18, 45, 6, 25]
- Agent 2: [68, 19, 15, 16, 36, 86, 5, 90]
- Agent 3: [14, 83, 19, 47, 85, 6, 16, 5]
- Agent 4: [34, 71, 0, 62, 63, 97, 34, 8]
- Agent 5: [14, 66, 65, 15, 81, 85, 56, 17]

We have 8 items and 6 agents, so each agent should ideally get 1 or 2 items.

Let's try to allocate the items maximizing the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 3 (86) - High value for this agent
2. **Agent 1**: Item 1 (88) - Highest value for this agent
3. **Agent 2**: Item 7 (90) - Highest value for this agent
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4 (85) - High value for this agent
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5 (97) - Highest value for this agent
6. **Agent 5**: Item 6 (56) - Decent value for this agent

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to distribute the remaining 2 items:

7. **Agent 2**: Item 5 (86) - Second highest value for this agent
8. **Agent 5**: Item 2 (65) - High value for this agent

Let's present the allocations in the given JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6, 2]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent receives items with relatively high personal value, while keeping the distribution fair with the given constraints.
