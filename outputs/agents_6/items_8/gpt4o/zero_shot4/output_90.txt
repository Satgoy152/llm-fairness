Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  10  25  14  88  61  14  98
1  32  21  89   8  52  14  94   6
2  93  12  89  98  72  72  61  70
3  44  88  50   9   6  32  66  97
4  94  94  60  19  12  18  39  13
5  74  19  73  87  96  26   5  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the constraint that we have exactly 8 items and 6 agents, some agents may receive more items than others. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If any agent receives more than their fair share (approximately 8 items / 6 agents â‰ˆ 1.33 items per agent, meaning 1 or 2 items in practice), redistribute to balance the allocations.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 7 (value 98)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (value 94)
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 3 (values 89, 98)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (value 88)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (value 94)
- Agent 5: Items 4 and 5 (values 96, 26)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and considers the highest valuations for each agent where possible. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```
