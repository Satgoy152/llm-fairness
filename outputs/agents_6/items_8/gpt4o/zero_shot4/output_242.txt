Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80   0  70  10  64  86   6   4
1   8  41  48  29  99  89  70  92
2  66  69  79  87  94  88   8  92
3  94  73   2  51  30  45  81   5
4  34  22  51  92  59  49  74  76
5  19  23  55  52  41  27  95  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can consider the valuations and try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences. Ideally, we want to distribute the items so that agents receive the items they value highly, while also ensuring that every item is allocated.

Here's a potential fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest among their options.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 highly, but it's already allocated, so item 5 is a good alternative.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 6 highly.

Given these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [6]

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 2 fairly. We can distribute them based on remaining high preferences:

- Agent 2 also values item 2 highly.
- Agent 1 would be a good fit for item 1 as they do not have a high preference for it, but it is still a fair allocation.

After this final allocation, here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6]
}
```
