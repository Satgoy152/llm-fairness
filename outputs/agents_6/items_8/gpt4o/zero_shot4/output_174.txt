Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  18  35  28  63  70  73  80
1  70  49  39  37  65  86  19  44
2  95  25  34  22  81  86  64  41
3  77   5  16  80  76  75   5   2
4  65  34   7  97  74  44  68  49
5  69  75  56  22  39  37  84  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocate item 7 (value 80) and item 6 (value 73) to Agent 0. These are the highest valued items for Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate item 5 (value 86) to Agent 1. This is the highest valued item for Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 0 (value 95) to Agent 2. This is the highest valued item for Agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate item 3 (value 80) to Agent 3. This is the highest valued item for Agent 3.
   
5. **Agent 4**:
   - Allocate item 1 (value 34) to Agent 4. This is the highest valued item for Agent 4 after considering the remaining items.
   
6. **Agent 5**:
   - Allocate items 2 (value 56) and 4 (value 39) to Agent 5. These are the highest valued items for Agent 5 after considering the remaining items.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
