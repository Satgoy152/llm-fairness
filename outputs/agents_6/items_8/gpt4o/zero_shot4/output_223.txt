Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  63  73  86   0  19  15  95
1   5   8  68  88   8  88  71   1
2  28  40  75  52  47  94  92  10
3  34  32  11  47  50  65  92  77
4  60  25  78  59  74  26  91  36
5   2  87  15  97  11  76  97   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and that the total value of items allocated to each agent is balanced. Given the constraints and the need for fairness, one approach is to try to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values for items 3 (86) and 7 (95).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values for items 3 (88) and 5 (88).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values for items 5 (94) and 6 (92).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values for items 6 (92) and 5 (65).
- **Agent 4**: Highest values for items 2 (78) and 6 (91).
- **Agent 5**: Highest values for items 3 (97) and 6 (97).

We'll aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes these values while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and no more than two items per agent, as we have only 8 items in total.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 3 and 7. (Values: 86, 95)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1. (Value: 8)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 5. (Value: 94)
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 6. (Value: 92)
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 2. (Value: 78)
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 0. (Value: 2)

In this allocation, every agent gets at least one item, and the distribution attempts to reflect the highest valuations for each agent.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```
