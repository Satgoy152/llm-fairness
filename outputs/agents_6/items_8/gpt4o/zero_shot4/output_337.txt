Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  26  26  34  51   7  40   3
1  53  29  58   0  98  45  56  64
2  14  99  90  50   4  44  70  71
3  18  55  46  19  96  99  22  38
4  67  46  88  42  15  44  53  94
5  56  17  74  85  28  56  86  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [56 17 74 85 28 56 86 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the table to make the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (51) and 0 (49).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (98) and 2 (58).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (99) and 2 (90).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (99) and 4 (96).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 7 (94) and 2 (88).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 7 (89) and 6 (86).

We should assign items in such a way that each agent gets the items they value the most, and try to ensure the total number of items allocated is equal to 8.

Let's make an initial allocation based on these observations:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value 98).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (highest value 99).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (highest value 94).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value 90).

Now, re-evaluate remaining items:

- Item 0 could go to Agent 0 (value 49).
- Item 6 could go to Agent 5 (value 86).
- Item 1 could go to Agent 2 (value 99).
- Item 3 could go to Agent 5 (value 85).

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6, 3]
}
```
