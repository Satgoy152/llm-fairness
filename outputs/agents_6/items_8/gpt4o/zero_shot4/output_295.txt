Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  20  95  68  22  48  36   2
1  84  76  73  15  92  31  21  84
2  34  54  11  34  65  91  96  93
3  67  92  81  24  56  15  89  62
4  89  90  50  92  87  70  19  39
5  90  89  25  79  52   4  54  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations.

Let's start by looking at the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 40 + 20 + 95 + 68 + 22 + 48 + 36 + 2 = 331
- Agent 1: 84 + 76 + 73 + 15 + 92 + 31 + 21 + 84 = 476
- Agent 2: 34 + 54 + 11 + 34 + 65 + 91 + 96 + 93 = 478
- Agent 3: 67 + 92 + 81 + 24 + 56 + 15 + 89 + 62 = 486
- Agent 4: 89 + 90 + 50 + 92 + 87 + 70 + 19 + 39 = 536
- Agent 5: 90 + 89 + 25 + 79 + 52 + 4 + 54 + 34 = 427

Given these valuations, we should attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives items where their valuation is relatively high, thus maximizing fairness.

To achieve this, we can start by assigning the highest-valued items to the agents who value them the most. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [2] (value: 95)
- Agent 1: [4, 7] (values: 92, 84)
- Agent 2: [5, 6] (values: 91, 96)
- Agent 3: [1] (value: 92)
- Agent 4: [3] (value: 92)
- Agent 5: [0] (value: 90)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item with a high valuation, and all items are distributed. Now let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation is just one of the possible fair distributions, and other arrangements could also satisfy the fairness criteria depending on the interpretation of fairness.
