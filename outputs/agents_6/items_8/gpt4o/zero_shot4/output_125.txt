Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  45  56  99  21  38  63   6
1  18  73  98  54  99  93  49  46
2  57  12  63   3  27  74  52  82
3  65  65  63  17  44  62  75  77
4  44  32  25  76  81  21  16  64
5  32  28  98   2  83  16  61  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must consider each agent's valuations and ensure that all 8 items are allocated uniquely among the agents. We'll try to distribute the items based on maximizing the agents' satisfaction considering their preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (99), so give them item 3.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (99), so give them item 4.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (82), so give them item 7.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (75), so give them item 6.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (81), but item 4 is already allocated. The next highest is item 3 (76), which is also allocated. The next highest is item 7 (64), which is also allocated. The next highest is item 0 (44), so give them item 0.
- Agent 5 values item 2 the highest (98), so give them item 2.

At this point, items 1 and 5 remain unallocated. Let's assign these remaining items:

- Agent 0 has item 3. Their next highest is item 6 (63), which is allocated. The next highest is item 0 (57), which is allocated. The next highest is item 2 (56), which is allocated. The next highest is item 1 (45), so give them item 1.
- Agent 3 has item 6. Their highest unallocated item is item 5 (62), so give them item 5.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents based on their highest preferences while avoiding any conflicts.
