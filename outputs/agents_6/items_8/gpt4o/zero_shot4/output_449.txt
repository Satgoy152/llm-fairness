Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  80  45  59  69  88   7  93
1  97  13  29  14  75  36  73  94
2   9  99  87  35  58  48  71   7
3  20  73  40  64  70  17  55  48
4  35   6  67  93  22  15  60  83
5  61  39  78  50  72  70  25  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items being allocated. Given that there are more agents than items, not every agent will receive an item.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their preferences, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations in descending order, ensuring no conflicts occur.

Here's one possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 7 to agent 0 (highest value for item 7 is 93).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (highest value for item 1 is 99).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (highest value for item 0 is 97).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (next highest value for item 4 is 75).
5. Assign item 6 to agent 1 (next highest value for item 6 is 73).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 5 (highest value for item 2 is 78).
7. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (highest value for item 3 is 93).
8. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (next highest value for item 5 is 88).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (except for agents who don't have high enough valuations to compete for any item), and all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```
