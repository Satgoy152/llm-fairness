Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  18  29  18  31  32  47  44
1  43   0  79  24  27  37  51  74
2  74  40   2  58  94  88  41  50
3  60   3  88   7   1  41  14  91
4   6  22  95  85   4  20  61  44
5  45  83  57  98  92  49   0  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures a balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations. One common approach is to use a round-robin or sequential selection method where agents take turns selecting their most valued available item until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with a simple greedy allocation that prioritizes each agent's highest valued item that hasn't been picked yet. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0** chooses item 6 (value 47).
2. **Agent 1** chooses item 7 (value 74).
3. **Agent 2** chooses item 4 (value 94).
4. **Agent 3** chooses item 2 (value 88).
5. **Agent 4** chooses item 2, but it's already taken, so they choose item 6, but it's also taken, so they choose item 3 (value 85).
6. **Agent 5** chooses item 3, but it's already taken, so they choose item 4, but it's also taken, so they choose item 1 (value 83).

Next round, we continue picking from remaining items:

7. **Agent 0** chooses item 0 (value 31).
8. **Agent 1** chooses item 5 (value 37).
9. **Agent 2** chooses item 5, but it's already taken, so they choose item 1 (value 40).
10. **Agent 3** chooses item 7, but it's already taken, so they choose item 0, but it's already taken, so they choose item 5, but it's already taken, so they choose item 1, but it's already taken, so they choose item 4 (value 1).
11. **Agent 4** chooses item 0, but it's already taken, so they choose item 1, but it's already taken, so they choose item 5, but it's already taken, so they choose item 0, but it's already taken, so they choose item 4, but it's already taken, so they choose item 1, but it's already taken, so they choose item 0, but it's already taken, so they choose item 5, but it's already taken, so they choose item 7 (value 44).
12. **Agent 5** chooses item 0, but it's already taken, so they choose item 3, but it's already taken, so they choose item 7, but it's already taken, so they choose item 2 (value 57).

Now all items have been allocated. Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair opportunity to pick based on their highest remaining valuation in each round. Note that some agents ended up with two items while others have one or none due to the constraints of an integer number of items per agent and the total number of items.
