Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  60  94  35  29  35  38  40
1  76   0  23  32  35  68  31  84
2  25  23  42  55  39  62  36   0
3  93  98  15  29  15  64  39  34
4  42  14  18  88  66  18  33  17
5  65  80  80  52  57  64  67   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent ends up with an allocation that maximizes their overall satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 2 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 7 (value 84).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 5 (value 62).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 1 (value 98).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 3 (value 88).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 1 (value 80). However, since item 1 is already allocated, the next highest is item 0 (value 65).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 4, 6) in a way that balances overall satisfaction:

- **Item 0**: Already allocated to Agent 5.
- **Item 4**: Best unallocated is Agent 4 (value 66), but it would be fair to balance allocations by giving this to Agent 5 (value 57).
- **Item 6**: Agent 5 has a reasonable value (67), so allocate it to them.

Final allocation JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
