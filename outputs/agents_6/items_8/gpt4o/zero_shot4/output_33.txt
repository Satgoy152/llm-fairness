Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  39  60   4  66  54  44  29
1  11  87  87  54  25  84  79  14
2  93  77  14   3  92  39   9  63
3  27  31  62  28  68  11  52  29
4  76   1  89   3  50  46  95  94
5   8  54   4   2  83  59  27  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a mechanism that aims to maximize the total valuation for all agents. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation by any agent, considering one item at a time. 

Let's determine an allocation:

1. Identify the highest-valued item for any agent.
2. Assign that item to the respective agent.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Using this approach:

- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (93). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (87). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 also values item 2 the highest (87). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (95). Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the highest (94). Assign item 7 to Agent 4.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (92). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (84). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (28). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, maximizing the total valuation across the agents.
