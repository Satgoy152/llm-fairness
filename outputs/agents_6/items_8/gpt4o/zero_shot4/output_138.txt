Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  96  13  31  13  32   2  64
1  21   7  13  80  90  42  45  33
2  42  18  14  56  86  67  89  92
3  21  18  64  17  87  33  26  48
4  18  21  62  16  36   9  53  72
5  64  27  34  32  62  79  88   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction, but also ensures that each agent receives at least one item if possible. We can do this by considering the agents' valuations of the items and ensuring a balanced allocation.

Here's one possible fair allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, starting with the highest-valued items, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's how the allocation could look:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

Explanation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 7, where they have relatively high valuations (31 and 64, respectively).
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4, which are highly valued by them (80 and 90, respectively).
- Agent 2 gets item 6, which has the highest valuation (89) by them among the agents.
- Agent 3 does not receive any item because other agents have higher valuations for the remaining items.
- Agent 4 receives item 2, which they value moderately but is the best available option for them.
- Agent 5 receives items 1 and 5, which they value significantly (27 and 79, respectively).

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, aiming to balance the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.
