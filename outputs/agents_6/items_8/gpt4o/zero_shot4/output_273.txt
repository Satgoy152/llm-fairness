Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  97   2  65  51  45   3  14
1  68  78  58  87  64  75  93  29
2  63  63  46   7  49  48  51  70
3  48  39  52  84  85  60  12  30
4  71  48  51  44  94  77  38  33
5   2  49  48  17  93  84  82   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We'll try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's start by distributing items one by one to agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least a few items if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 68, so assign it to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 97, so assign it to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 58, so assign it to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 84, so assign it to Agent 3.
5. Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 94, so assign it to Agent 4.
6. Item 5: Agent 5 values it the most at 84, so assign it to Agent 5.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 93, so assign it to Agent 1.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 70, so assign it to Agent 2.

Now, let's express this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed based on the agents' valuations, and each agent receives at least one item.
