Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  19  28  96  65  74   2   0
1  50  17  99  98  39  34  66  91
2   8  38  66   0  71  45  22  94
3  71   8  96  81  11  78  86  17
4  40  66  45  51  56  86  34  16
5  73  82  92  45  34  56  10  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes fairness. One approach is to use a method like maximizing the total valuation or ensuring each agent gets items they value the most.

Let's try to allocate the items based on maximizing the satisfaction for each agent, possibly by assigning items with the highest valuation to each agent until all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 3 (Value: 96)
   - Item 5 (Value: 74)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 2 (Value: 99)
   - Item 7 (Value: 91)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 4 (Value: 71)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 6 (Value: 86)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Item 1 (Value: 66)

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Item 0 (Value: 73)

This allocation ensures that items are distributed in a way that each agent receives a high-value item based on their own valuations. Each agent might not get an equal number of items, but the goal here is to maximize their satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```
