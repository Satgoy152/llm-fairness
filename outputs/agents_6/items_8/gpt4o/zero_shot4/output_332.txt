Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  10   5   8  55  59  48  27
1  97  20  80  58  40  83  48  79
2  38  61  25   0  25  64  63  77
3  70  44   2   6  53  95  72  55
4   2  23  12  31  58  56  39  34
5  94  16  49  31  97  43  58  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Given the constraints and the valuations, we will proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents to identify the most valued items and prioritize their allocation.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a suggested allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (97).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (61).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (80).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it (58).
- Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most (97).
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most (95).
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most (72).
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (77).

Considering the above allocations, here is the JSON format for allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to only one agent and all 8 items are distributed.
