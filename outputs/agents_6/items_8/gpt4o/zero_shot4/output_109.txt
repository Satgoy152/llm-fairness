Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  22  29  84   7  19  98  12
1  60  29   2  68  61   7  70  25
2  88   5  76  84  32  80  74  51
3  82  88  33  94  41  97  90  95
4  12  77  87  21  32  60  24   8
5  83  33  23  22  32  13  69  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we can use a round-robin approach to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, while considering the preferences of the agents based on their valuations. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, two agents will get 2 items each, and the rest will get 1 item each.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 6 (value 98). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 0 (value 60). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 88), but it's taken. The next highest is item 3 (value 84). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 3 (value 94), but it's taken. The next highest is item 5 (value 97). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 2 (value 87). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for Agent 5 is item 0 (value 83), but it's taken. The next highest is item 6 (value 69), but it's taken. The next highest is item 7 (value 28). Assign item 7 to Agent 5.

We have now allocated 6 items. Two more items need to be allocated. Let's continue:

7. **Agent 0**: The next highest item for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 84), but it's taken. The next highest is item 2 (value 29), but it's taken. The next highest is item 1 (value 22). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 1**: The next highest item for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 61). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

All 8 items have now been allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7]
}
```
