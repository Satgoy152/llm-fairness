Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  57  20  49  88  26  82  66
1  81  67   8  10  49  34  61  26
2  40  63  66  68  26  59   0  41
3  16  90  43  93  64  53  73  37
4   5  72  57  73  15  22  29  23
5  33  72   5  28  82  53   0  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's the allocation process based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 70).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 90).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by agent 2 (value 66).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 93).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 88).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by agents 2 and 5 (value 59 and 53, respectively). We can assign it to agent 2 for balance.
7. Item 6 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 82).
8. Item 7 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 66).

Let's check if all items are allocated fairly:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items

This allocation gives each item to the agent who values it the most among those who have not yet received a balancing number of items. Now, let's present it in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
