Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  25  81  10  74   2  90   1
1   7  47  87  35   9  79   1  39
2  34  79  77  19  49  42  83  74
3  15  44  47  49  40  42  37  85
4  12   4  39  82  51  92  62  44
5  45  61  68  37  48  31  31  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 7 47 87 35  9 79  1 39]
 [34 79 77 19 49 42 83 74]

 [45 61 68 37 48 31 31 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's analyze the table and assign items accordingly.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 6 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 2 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 1 (79).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 7 (85).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 5 (92).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation for item 4 (48).

After the initial allocation, all agents have one item, and we have assigned 6 out of 8 items. We need to allocate 2 more items without changing the fairness significantly.

Let's distribute the remaining items (0 and 3) to the agents who would benefit most from them:

- **Agent 0**: Also values item 0 highly (79).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 3 highly (82).

This allocation ensures that the distribution is as fair as possible while maximizing the total valuation for the agents. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 3],
    "5": [4]
}
```
