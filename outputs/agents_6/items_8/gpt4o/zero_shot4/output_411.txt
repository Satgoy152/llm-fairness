Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  64  22  35  15  46   1  48
1  69  79  94  83  35  67  27  91
2  29  32  38  78  46   4   1   4
3  26   9  85  82  47  72  91  64
4  60  46  86  65   2  85  35  77
5  16  21  33  27  37  11  44  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. Here's a possible way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the table and find the maximum value each item has for any agent:

- Item 0: Highest value is 69 (Agent 1)
- Item 1: Highest value is 79 (Agent 1)
- Item 2: Highest value is 94 (Agent 1)
- Item 3: Highest value is 83 (Agent 1)
- Item 4: Highest value is 47 (Agent 3)
- Item 5: Highest value is 85 (Agent 4)
- Item 6: Highest value is 91 (Agent 3)
- Item 7: Highest value is 91 (Agent 1)

Based on the highest valuations, we can assign the items as follows:

- Agent 0: No items (since they have the lowest or among the lowest valuations for all items)
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 7] (Items with highest valuations by Agent 1)
- Agent 2: No items (since they have low valuations for most items)
- Agent 3: [4, 6] (Items with high valuations by Agent 3)
- Agent 4: [5] (Item with the highest valuation by Agent 4)
- Agent 5: No items (since they have lower valuations compared to other agents)

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is only assigned once and all items are allocated.
