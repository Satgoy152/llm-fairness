Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  89   3  23  37   7   4  40
1  47  60  62  14  43  40  78  67
2  45  83  19  52  97  76  93  88
3  52  46  38   9  45  42  55  82
4  44  20   2  59  65  20  29  18
5  45  79  43  33  40  81  64  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent receives some items while all items are allocated. One approach is to utilize a fair division method, such as maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated.

Let's start by considering the highest valuations for each item and attempt to assign them to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (Value: 89)
- Agent 1: Items 2, 6 (Values: 62, 78)
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5 (Values: 97, 76)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (Value: 82)
- Agent 4: Item 3 (Value: 59)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (Value: 45)

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each item and distributes the items fairly among the agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
