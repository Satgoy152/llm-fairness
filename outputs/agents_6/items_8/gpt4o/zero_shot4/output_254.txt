Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  92  21  17  32  72  98  53
1  38  59   2  45  95  70  93  77
2  74  34  14  78  72  90  27  17
3   7  41  53  32   0  24   2  89
4  29  11  54  43  21  93  82  43
5  89  90  51   3  71   9  10  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items based on their valuations. We need to ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation that takes into consideration the agents' valuations:

1. Agent 0 has a particularly high valuation for item 6. 
2. Agent 1 values item 4 very highly.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 highly, but since it is already allocated, we'll look at the next highest, which is item 2.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 highly.

Now for the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 0

Now we need to allocate the remaining items (1 and 3) to ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 3

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```
