Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  27  11   4  37  61   2  31
1  80  16  31  19  59  23  18  21
2  21  46  85  48  59  12   0  63
3  93  19  88  68  44  14  26  49
4  49  15  38  33  85   1  46  58
5   4  58  90   8  89  60  53  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider a strategy that ensures each agent receives a reasonable share of the total valuation. We can use the method of maximizing total value by allocating items to the agents who value them the most. Here's one way to achieve that:

1. For each item, find the agent who values it the most and allocate that item to the agent.
2. Ensure all 8 items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most with 93.
- Item 1: Agent 5 values it the most with 58.
- Item 2: Agents 3 and 5 both value it highly, but Agent 5 values it the most with 90.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most with 68.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most with 85.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with 61.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most with 53.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most with 63.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it most, thus maximizing total valuation.
