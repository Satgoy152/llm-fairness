Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  83  84  62  38  12  14  89
1  85  61  96  49  14  88  20  71
2  40  84  11  26  42  63  42  19
3  46  85  12  40  93  44  38  63
4  77  70  25   2  26  58  41  46
5  38  82  35  65  97  68  51  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This method ensures that each item benefits an agent as much as possible based on their individual valuations.

Let's check each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

- Item 0: Highest value is 85 (Agent 1).
- Item 1: Highest value is 85 (Agent 3).
- Item 2: Highest value is 96 (Agent 1).
- Item 3: Highest value is 65 (Agent 5).
- Item 4: Highest value is 97 (Agent 5).
- Item 5: Highest value is 88 (Agent 1).
- Item 6: Highest value is 51 (Agent 5).
- Item 7: Highest value is 89 (Agent 0).

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is given to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that the distribution is fair based on the given valuations.
