Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  17  74   8  21  87  50  56
1  66  50  56  93  62  35  84  12
2  65  60  98  82  93  43  63  68
3  71  70  58  77  23   5  23  19
4  48  73  45  66  15  24  79  94
5  64  87  34  77  83  19  27  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. This is a common problem in fair division, and one approach is to use the "maximin" strategy, where each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items.

Let's determine the allocation by considering each agent's highest-valued items and trying to distribute them fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest-valued item is 5 (value: 87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest-valued item is 3 (value: 93).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest-valued item is 2 (value: 98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest-valued item is 0 (value: 71).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest-valued item is 7 (value: 94).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest-valued item is 1 (value: 87).

We'll allocate these highest-valued items to each respective agent first and then distribute the remaining items to try to maintain a balance in overall satisfaction.

Now, we have allocated 6 items to 6 agents, so we need to fairly distribute the remaining 2 items. Let's look at the next highest available items and allocate them to agents who might have slightly lower total value from their first item:

- For Agent 0, their next highest-valued item is 2 (value: 74).
- For Agent 1, their next highest-valued item is 6 (value: 84).

Allocating these two additional items:

- Agent 0: Items 5 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 6

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: 5, 2
- Agent 1: 3, 6
- Agent 2: 2
- Agent 3: 0
- Agent 4: 7
- Agent 5: 1

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the items are distributed according to their valuations as fairly as possible.

Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

Please note that while we have tried to balance the allocations, fairness is subjective and can depend on the context and additional rules or constraints if there are any.
