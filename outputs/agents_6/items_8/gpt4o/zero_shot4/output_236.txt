Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  73  90   2  51  19   1  31
1  73  29  86   1  47  16  35  60
2  26  84  44  72  79  30  59   1
3  47   2  87  64  88  65  45  46
4   0  15  53  40  90  98  67  72
5  50   4   6  39  96  42  14  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll look for a balanced distribution of the items based on the valuations provided.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 2, which has the highest valuation for this agent.
2. Agent 1 receives item 7, which has one of the highest valuations for this agent.
3. Agent 2 receives item 1, which has the highest valuation for this agent.
4. Agent 3 receives item 4, which has the highest valuation for this agent.
5. Agent 4 receives item 5, which has the highest valuation for this agent.
6. Agent 5 receives item 3, which has the highest valuation for this agent.
7. The remaining items 0 and 6 can be allocated to agents with the next highest valuations that haven't already been maximized:

   - Agent 0 also receives item 0.
   - Agent 4 also receives item 6.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item, and all 8 items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [3]
}
```
