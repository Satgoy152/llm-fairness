Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  12  81  68   1  44  26  99
1  37  86  61  14  83   6  31  18
2   8  37  99  32  90  26   6  51
3  37  48  29  75  73  62  14  45
4   7  53  23  23  72   4  44  90
5  33  15  13  36  34  29   1  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's consider a method that maximizes individual satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuation for each item. We will ensure each agent gets at least one item or an empty allocation if necessary.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Assign items based on highest valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values this the most at 87.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values this the most at 86.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values this the most at 99.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values this the most at 75.
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values this the most at 90.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values this the most at 44.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values this the most at 26.
   - Item 7: Agent 0 values this the most at 99.

2. **Adjust allocations to ensure fairness:**
   - Agent 0 has too many items (4 items), and Agent 4 and 5 currently have no items.
   - Reassign some items from Agent 0 to Agents 4 and 5 to balance allocations while considering their valuations.
   - Item 6 can reasonably go to Agent 5 because Agent 0 values it the lowest.
   - Item 5 can go to Agent 4 because Agent 0 has higher valued items.

Now, let's present the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item or an empty allocation, and all items are allocated.
