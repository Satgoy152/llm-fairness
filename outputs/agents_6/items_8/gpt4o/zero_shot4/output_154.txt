Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  99  81   4  31  94  95  96
1  62   1   1   6  92  77  51  93
2  39  68  99  20  19  16  52  58
3  80  78  75  22  55  52  24   0
4  79  47  39  49   1  62  97  31
5   9  94  99  94  41  63   3  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated. We'll consider maximizing the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent can get at least one item, if possible.

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1, 5, 6, and 7. We can allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 7. We can allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 and 1. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0 and 1. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for item 6. We can allocate item 6 to Agent 4, but since it is already allocated, we choose the next highest which is item 5.
6. **Agent 5** has high valuations for items 1 and 3. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 5.

Now we are left with items 3 and 4 which need to be allocated. We can assign these remaining items to agents who have not received many items yet:

- **Agent 4** can also take item 4.
- **Agent 1** can take item 3.

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents with each agent receiving highly valued items where possible.
