Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  99   2  78  86   7  78  52
1  73  56  59  37  29   8  99  86
2  11  24  16  50  81  56  11  28
3  52  53  32  76  88  44  87  22
4  37  99  85  64  66   3  73  84
5  17  32   3   0  20  67  92  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [73 56 59 37 29  8 99 86]

 [17 32  3  0 20 67 92 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we should consider the valuations provided in the table while ensuring that each agent gets a fair distribution based on their preferences. Here's one way to achieve that distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that have relatively higher values for Agent 0 and aren't as highly valued by others.
2. **Agent 1**: Do the same for Agent 1, considering a balance between high value and fairness.
3. **Agent 2**: Consider items where Agent 2 has a reasonable or unique interest.
4. **Agent 3**: Look for items where Agent 3 has a relatively higher valuation.
5. **Agent 4**: Distribute items where Agent 4 shows interest, especially if they are less valued by others.
6. **Agent 5**: Assign items that are valued by Agent 5 but are less contested.

Let's allocate the items based on these considerations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 3 (Values: 56, 78)
- **Agent 1**: Items 7 (Value: 86)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (Value: 81)
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (Value: 87)
- **Agent 4**: Items 1 and 2 (Values: 99, 85)
- **Agent 5**: Item 5 (Value: 67)

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each of the 8 items is assigned to an agent, respecting their preferences to the extent possible.
