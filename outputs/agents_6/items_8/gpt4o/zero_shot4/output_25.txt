Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  84  94  69  59  49  26  99
1  57  64   0  44   0  56  52  78
2  58  29  87  18  72  20  36  12
3   3  40   0  43  13  96  19  11
4  53  33  42  36  65  68  17  13
5  81  39  25  35  86   8  74  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a balanced manner, considering their valuations. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high value for item 7, so we'll allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high value for item 1 and item 7, but since item 7 is already allocated, we'll give Agent 1 item 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most, so we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5, so we'll allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 has a high value for item 4, so we'll allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 has high values for items 0 and 6, so we'll allocate items 0 and 6 to Agent 5.
- This leaves item 3 unallocated, and Agent 4 has the next highest valuation for item 3, so we'll allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```
