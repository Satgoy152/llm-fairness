Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  73  68  85  83  85  10  79
1  21  78  71  77  80  79  89  82
2  44   0  50  54  76  35  95  36
3  79  51  68  95  71  86  79  14
4   9  45  60  59  71  48  45  72
5  70  31  15  64  53  19  33  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their individual valuations. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item, and prioritize allocating those items to them if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, as much as the total number of items allows.
3. Balance the distribution to cover all items with minimal overlap and maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation.

Based on the table and the above strategy, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly, so allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly, but since it's already allocated, allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly, so allocate item 7 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 highly, but since it is allocated, allocate item 1 to agent 5.

After the first round, we have allocated 6 items. To fairly distribute the remaining items, consider the second-highest values:

- Allocate item 2 to agent 3 as it has a decent valuation for it.
- Allocate item 5 to agent 0 to balance the distribution.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated based on agents' valuations.
