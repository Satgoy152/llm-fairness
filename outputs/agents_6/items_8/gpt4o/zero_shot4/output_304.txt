Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  68  79  61  91  81  94  19
1  68  56  46   4   2  45  18  10
2  74  81  53  14  93  25  66  53
3  64  43  20  85  54  41  84   6
4  70  61  96  97  61   9  55  13
5  43  41  92  16   4  41  70  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we will use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall valuation for each agent. We will consider each agent's highest-valued items and allocate them accordingly. 

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve the allocation:

1. **Identify the Maximum Valuations:** For each agent, identify the item they value the most.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:** Start allocating items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:** Check that all items are allocated, and if any conflicts arise (like two agents valuing the same item the most), resolve them by considering the next highest value or balancing the total number of items among agents.

4. **Output the Allocation:** Once all items are allocated, ensure the JSON format is maintained, with all agents listed, even if they receive no items.

Following these steps, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 6.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 0 (already taken by Agent 0, so we go for their next highest, item 2).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3.
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 2 (already taken by Agent 1, so we go for their next highest, item 3, already taken by Agent 3, so item 7).
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 2 (already taken by Agent 1).

Let's resolve conflicts and finalize the allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 again (they have a high value for it, and item 6 is still available).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents as per the given conditions.
