Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  31  13  11  27  68   5  10
1  26  91  72  31   8  12  53  75
2  24  38  55  27   1  15  89  95
3  36  14  66  35  60  28   8  46
4  79  45  37  66  13  63  71  29
5  47  62  53  92   0  15  69  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that balances the total valuation each agent receives. One approach is to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations. This method should ensure that each agent gets items that are more valuable to them. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1: 91.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 7: 95.
3. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 4: 60.
4. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 0: 79.
5. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 3: 92.
6. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 5: 68.
7. **Agent 3** also has a high valuation for item 2: 66.
8. **Agent 1** also has a high valuation for item 6: 53.

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest remaining valuations for items not yet allocated:

- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 6
- **Agent 2**: Item 7
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 4
- **Agent 4**: Item 0
- **Agent 5**: Item 3
- **Agent 0**: Item 5

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, and each agent receives items that are of relatively high value to them.
