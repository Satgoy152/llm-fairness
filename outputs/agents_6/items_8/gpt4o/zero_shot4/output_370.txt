Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  81   8  45  43  38  58  83
1  61  39  58  34  46  76  58  30
2  58  29  78   4  76  40   4  71
3  74  13  34  61  85   7  38  61
4   0  26  58   4  14  53  61  23
5  53  95  24  50  79  74  15  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value received by each agent and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use the "highest value first" strategy, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that the total number of allocations equals the total number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 has the highest value (74).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 5 has the highest value (95).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 has the highest value (78).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 has the highest value (61).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 has the highest value (85).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 has the highest value (76).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 has the highest value (61).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 has the highest value (83).

After assigning items based on the highest valuation, let's summarize:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3, 4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```
