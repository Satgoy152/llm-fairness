Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  66  72  77  31  10  32  12
1  11  95  22  99  40  78  69  76
2  39  17  77  10   9  17  67  30
3  45  64  33  97  11  38  26  68
4  68  52   9   3  81  68  58  60
5  29  91  13  42  94   2  88  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent according to their valuations. Here is one possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 2.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 4.

Given these considerations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 3 to agent 1 since it has the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 since it has the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 since it has the highest valuation for it after considering agent 0's allocation.
- Assign item 4 to agent 5 since it has the highest valuation for it.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 since it has the second-highest valuation for it after considering agent 5's allocation.
- Assign item 6 to agent 2 since it has a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 0 to agent 4 since it has a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 7 to agent 3 since it has a high valuation for it.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8, which matches the number of items available.
