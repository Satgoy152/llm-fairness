Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  74  82  93  89   8   4   8
1  22  60   5  13  11  29  69  81
2  55  36  83  18   3  21  78  26
3  52  83   5  66  61   5  69  97
4  40  30  10  39  69  11  32  48
5  42  46  32  30  27  95   6  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. Allocating them item 2 gives them a high value.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a high valuation for items 6 and 7. Allocating them item 7 gives them a high value.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 highly, but since it's already allocated, we give them item 6, which is the next highest value for them.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent has a high valuation for item 7, but since it's already allocated, we give them item 1, which is the next highest value for them.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent has a relatively high valuation for item 4.

6. **Agent 5**: This agent has high valuations for items 5 and 7. Since item 7 is taken, we give them item 5.

By following this allocation, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item except agent 4, who receives one item based on their highest valuation.
