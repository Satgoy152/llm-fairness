Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  85  71  14  54  77  26  97
1  35  62  12   6  27  54  80   0
2  88  94  48  65  64  10  43  64
3  68  69  99  57  45   0  83  46
4  38  40  25  56   3  73  75  26
5  65  86  18  66  11  25  71  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item whenever possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. In case of a tie, the item can be assigned to any of the agents with the highest valuation.

Based on the given valuations, the allocation might look like this:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (value 88)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (value 94)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (value 99)
- Item 3: Agent 5 (value 66)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (value 54)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 77)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (value 80)
- Item 7: Agent 0 (value 97)

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item if possible.
