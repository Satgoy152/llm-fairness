Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  87  92  82  67  85   7  80
1   4  68  53  46  36  64  98  71
2  95  53  57  80  81  57  27  21
3  13  97  86  76  20  29   1  79
4  96   4  52  32  26  78  58  35
5  89  83  82  93  42  18  25  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Firstly, let's consider the number of agents (6) and items (8). We can start by giving one item to each agent to ensure everyone gets something, and then distribute the remaining 2 items to the agents with the highest valuations for those items.

Below is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Assign one item to each agent based on the highest value for each agent.
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (Value 92)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (Value 98)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (Value 95)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (Value 97)
   - Agent 4: Item 5 (Value 78)
   - Agent 5: Item 3 (Value 93)

2. **Allocate Remaining Items**: There are 2 remaining items to allocate, which are items not yet assigned.
   - Remaining items: [4, 7]

3. **Assign Remaining Items**: Choose agents who would get the highest value boost from these items.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (Value 81) - This boosts Agent 2's total significantly.
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (Value 80) - This gives Agent 0 a higher total value.

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```
