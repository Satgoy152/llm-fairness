Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  67  88  58  69  63  99  78
1  37  46  13  47  61  97  90   9
2  48  47  46  75  80  71  60  87
3  89   8  38  42  46  19  90  34
4   4  69  91  28  97  28  39  82
5  42  89  15  39  41  80  59  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. A potential approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each agent picks the item that is most valuable to them in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Selects item 6 (value 99)
2. **Agent 1**: Selects item 5 (value 97)
3. **Agent 2**: Selects item 4 (value 80)
4. **Agent 3**: Selects item 0 (value 89)
5. **Agent 4**: Selects item 4 is already taken, next highest is item 2 (value 91)
6. **Agent 5**: Selects item 1 (value 89)

Continuing the allocation until all items are assigned:

7. **Agent 0**: Next highest value item is 2 (value 88)
8. **Agent 1**: Next highest value item is 6 (value 90), but it's taken, next is 7 (value 9)
9. **Agent 2**: Selects item 3 (value 75)
10. **Agent 3**: Selects item 7 (value 34)
11. **Agent 4**: All items are taken
12. **Agent 5**: Selects item 3 is taken, next highest is item 5 (value 80), but it's taken, next is 7 (value 56)

Now, let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent gets an integer number of items. Note that this is one of several possible allocations; different strategies might yield different results.
