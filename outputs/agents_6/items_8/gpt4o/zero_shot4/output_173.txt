Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  59  73  32  13   6  89  82
1  98  47  30  95  49  54  71  55
2  54  95  98  82  72   8   7  56
3  55  67  64   1  63  86  94  87
4  19  83  50  85  69  60  14  11
5  27  13  74  98   9  63  38  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, two agents will end up with two items each, and the rest will have one item each.

Let's start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent and then allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item is item 6 (value 89).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item is item 0 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item is item 2 (value 98).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item is item 6 (value 94), but item 7 (value 87) is the next highest available since item 6 is already taken.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item is item 1 (value 83).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item is item 3 (value 98).

Now, let's assign the remaining two items. Among the remaining items (items 4 and 5), we will allocate based on the highest remaining values for the agents who could maximize their total value:

- **Agent 0** could take item 7 (value 82), which is their next highest value after item 6.
- **Agent 3** could take item 5 (value 86), which is their next highest value after item 7.

After this allocation, each agent except Agent 0 and Agent 3 gets one item, and Agent 0 and Agent 3 get two items, covering all 8 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```
