Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8   4  77  98  98  13  65  39
1  32  88  34   9  42  31  86  42
2  11  45  32  82  67  28  62  89
3  34  28  46  89  48  15  24  44
4  53  89   8  91  26  44  35  98
5   8  92  61  92  47  39  45  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes total satisfaction based on the agents' valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are only 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than others. Here's an allocation strategy that attempts to balance the distribution based on valuation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, or consider their next highest valued item if the highest one is already taken.
3. Balance out the distribution, so no agent gets an unfair advantage.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 98)
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 88)
- Agent 2 gets item 7 (value 89)
- Agent 3 gets item 2 (value 46)
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 26)
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 39) and item 6 (value 45)
- Agent 4 also gets item 0 (value 53)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and items are distributed based on the agentsâ€™ valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 0],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
