Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  64  75  31  57  50  65  83
1   3  34  90  39  89  87  31  15
2   9  25  38  58  33   6  22  59
3  41  92  15  61  11  90  58   2
4  56  47  38  70  41  76  21  60
5  55  36  27  13  20  55  70  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable value based on their preferences. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items, considering the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: [7 (83), 0 (78)]
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: [2 (90), 4 (89)]
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: [3 (58), 7 (59)]
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: [1 (92), 5 (90)]
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued items: [5 (76), 3 (70)]
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valued items: [6 (70), 7 (68)]
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 5.

Now, let's check to make sure all items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6
- Remaining items: 0, 4

Allocate remaining items to agents with lesser allocations:
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (since they have a high value of 78 for it).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (since they have a high value of 89 for it).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8, as required.
