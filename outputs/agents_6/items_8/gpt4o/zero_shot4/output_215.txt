Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  51   1  74  62  21  17  59
1  46  58  41   0  91  84  28   7
2   5  29  58  96  53  61  25  37
3  26  10  27  87  34  49  94  44
4  24   5  87   7  29   9  11  36
5  64  66  19  12  55  10   4  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can adopt a method that aims to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations per agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 highly (74).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (91).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly (96), but it's already taken by agent 0. The next highest is item 5 (61).
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly (94).
5. Agent 4 values item 2 highly (87).
6. Agent 5 values item 1 highly (66).

This allocation method ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and we are considering their highest valuations. The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [1]

Now, we verify if all items are allocated. Currently, we have allocated six items (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We need to allocate two more items, ensuring no agent receives more than 2 items:

7. Agent 0 can also be given item 7 (59), as it has a decent value.
8. Agent 1 can be given item 0 (46), which is the highest remaining value for them.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives their most valued available items.
