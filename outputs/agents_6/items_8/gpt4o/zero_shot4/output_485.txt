Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40   8  52  57  35  11  72  81
1  51  85  81   6  82  26  89  49
2  62  47  62  14  52  29  18   6
3  88  36  29  34  89  81  93  84
4  36  33  51  68  88  23  15  95
5  33  37  92  66  98  68  79  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [33 37 92 66 98 68 79 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none. We can use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate items:

1. Create a list of all possible allocations in the form of (agent, item, value), sorted by value in descending order.
2. Initialize empty allocations for each agent.
3. Iterate through the sorted list and assign items to agents if they don't have an item yet or if assigning the item doesn't exceed the total available items.
4. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent's allocation is an integer number of items.

Applying this approach to the given data:

1. Create a list of all possible (agent, item, value) pairs.
2. Sort this list by value in descending order.
3. Allocate items to the agents.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4, 3, 1]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 gets item 2 with a value of 52.
- Agent 1 gets item 6 with a value of 89.
- Agent 2 does not receive any items.
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 5 with values 88 and 81, respectively.
- Agent 4 gets item 7 with a value of 95.
- Agent 5 gets items 4, 3, and 1 with values 98, 66, and 37, respectively.

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, maximizing the total value received by each agent based on their valuations.
