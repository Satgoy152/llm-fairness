Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  20  81  36  58  43   0  20
1  15   1  63  42  11  72  66  33
2  58  40  36  33  26  60  87  65
3   1  29  54  56  90  23  51  79
4  81  25  97  15  14  27  89  89
5  81  56  38   9  32  54   0  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items based on the highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and that the total number of items allocated equals 8. We will try to balance the allocations so that no agent feels significantly worse off compared to others. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 2, but since it's already allocated, we go with item 0.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 0, but since it's already allocated, we go with item 1.

Now let's allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 2.
- **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 7.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 6.
- **Agent 3**: Next highest is item 3.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 0.
- **Agent 5**: Next highest is item 7, but since it's already allocated, we go with item 5.

Finally, verify that each agent has at least one item and exactly 8 items are allocated in total. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
