Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  46  53  74  21  95  84  32
1  83  31  30   8  48  61  84  10
2  53  26  86  57  60  12  11  33
3   6  47  33  83  58  45   2  85
4  65  33  97  63  91  74   9  17
5  63  80  10  75  48  73  64  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations of the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent at least one item they value highly, if possible.
2. Distribute remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent.

Let's analyze the table and allocate items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (95), so assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (83), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (86), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly (83), so assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly (97), but it's already taken, so assign item 4 to agent 4, as it is their second highest value (91).
- Agent 5 values item 7 highly (96), so assign item 7 to agent 5.

Now, only items 1 and 6 are left unallocated.

- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 1 (80), so assign item 1 to agent 5.
- Agent 0 values item 6 highly (84), so assign item 6 to agent 0.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7, 1]
}
```
