Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  18  54  62  86   0  34  94
1  79  39  17   6  69  74   5  42
2  53  27   0  67  59  45  94  89
3  59  75  81  62  82  30   4  45
4  55   1  18   4  77  13  81  49
5  62   1  15  84  29  42  11  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, where possible. Given the constraint that we must allocate exactly 8 items, we'll try to allocate items based on the highest value each agent places on them, while ensuring no agent is left without an item if possible.

Let's go through the allocations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 (86) and 7 (94). We'll allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (79). We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6 (94). We'll allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1 (75) and 2 (81). We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4 (77). We'll allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 3 (84). We'll allocate item 3 to Agent 5.

Now, 6 items have been allocated, and 2 items remain. Let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 5 has not been allocated. Agent 1 values it at 74, the highest for this item. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Item 1 has not been allocated. Agent 3 values it at 75, which is the highest remaining value for this item. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now all 8 items have been allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all 8 items.
