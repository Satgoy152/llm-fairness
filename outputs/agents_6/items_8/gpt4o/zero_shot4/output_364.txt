Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  59  27  14  77  44  78  91
1  59  47  53  94  94  72  60  98
2  39  61  36  37  94  35  29  91
3  38  17  94  35  15  55  10  19
4  21  70  39  96   8  80   8  62
5  44  74  14  46  83  11  73  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. One approach is to aim for a distribution where each agent receives items based on their highest valuations to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation plan:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most with 96.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most with 70.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most with 94.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most with 96.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with 77.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most with 80.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most with 78.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most with 98.

After this initial allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: [0, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1, 3, 5]
- Agent 5: []

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and all items are distributed among the agents. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 3, 5],
    "5": []
}
```
