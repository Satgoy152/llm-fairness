Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  31  61  64  23  96  75  76
1   0  97  83  10  65   5  53  11
2  70  72  23  57  11  99  82   4
3  11  88  33  62   2  66  12  94
4  40  99  73  55  13  90  22  64
5  65  41  79  10  89  81  11  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations that each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness of the allocation. Here is one possible way to allocate the items based on the valuations provided:

1. Agent 0: Has high valuations for items 0 (85) and 5 (96).
2. Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 1 (97).
3. Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 5 (99).
4. Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 7 (94).
5. Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 1 (99), but we must consider agent 1's valuation for item 1, so we can give agent 4 item 6 (22) instead.
6. Agent 5: Highest valuation is for item 4 (89).

Allocating the items based on these considerations, we get the following distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Item 4

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
