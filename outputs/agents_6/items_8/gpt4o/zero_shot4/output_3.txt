Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  49  85  80  30  83  74  29
1  48  26   1  96  93  31   2   3
2  50  87  59  57  95  46  75  42
3   7  32  26  15  90  48   3  37
4  14  97  36  98   1  38   1  96
5  15  82  42  32  97  11  91  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring every agent gets at least one item, if possible. A simple heuristic is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's go through the table to determine the allocations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most (80).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most (97).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (85).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the most (98).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 5 values it the most (97).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most (83).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 5 values it the most (91).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the most (96).

Now let's format this into the required JSON structure:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 3, 7],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, with a focus on maximizing the individual valuations for each agent. Note that agents 1, 2, and 3 do not receive any items because the values they place on items are lower than those of other agents, following our heuristic approach.
