Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8   6   5  53  40  36  58  13
1  57  82  88  72  69  25  30  42
2  85  75  89  77  78  32  87  20
3  13  54  18  34  65  39  61   6
4  70  54  84  23  15  23  40  50
5  97  48  97  57  42  55  96  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8  6  5 53 40 36 58 13]
 [57 82 88 72 69 25 30 42]
 [85 75 89 77 78 32 87 20]

 [97 48 97 57 42 55 96 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is exactly 8. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most (58).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (88).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most, but it's taken; next is item 6 (87).
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most (65).
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most, but it's taken; next is item 0 (70).
6. Agent 5 values item 0 the most, but it's taken; next is item 2 (97).

Now, let's finalize the allocation by ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and total allocations equal 8:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 3

This allocation gives all agents at least one item and distributes all 8 items. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 7]
}
```
