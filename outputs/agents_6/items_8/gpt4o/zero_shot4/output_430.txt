Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  10  75  80  17  83  87  69
1  60  73  12  72  48  89  80  57
2  21  63  53  26   7  82  59  35
3  94  83  34  63  48  10  80  99
4  81  42  56  33  83  87  10  95
5  22  31  50  11  65  34  45  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers each agent's valuation of the items and aims to maximize overall satisfaction. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item.

One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest valuations until all items are allocated. Here's how we can proceed:

1. List all item valuations along with their respective agent numbers.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on valuations.
3. Allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

1. Sort the items by valuation:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 at 87.
   - Agent 4 values item 5 at 87.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 83.
   - Agent 3 values item 7 at 99.
   - Agent 3 values item 0 at 94.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 73.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 at 89.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 at 82.
   - Agent 3 values item 1 at 83.
   - Agent 4 values item 0 at 81.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 72.

2. Assign items based on highest valuation:
   - Item 7 is allocated to Agent 3.
   - Item 0 is allocated to Agent 3 (Agent 3 had the highest valuation for item 0).
   - Item 1 is allocated to Agent 1.
   - Item 6 is allocated to Agent 0.
   - Item 5 is allocated to Agent 4.
   - Item 4 is allocated to Agent 4 (next highest remaining for Agent 4).
   - Item 3 is allocated to Agent 1 (Agent 1 had the highest remaining valuation for item 3).
   - Item 2 is allocated to Agent 0 (next highest remaining for Agent 0).

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and agents with higher valuations get the items they value most.
