Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  93  30  21  26  19  88  21
1  10  66  36  39   0  18  33  59
2  57   8  96  67  30  21  26  44
3  15  17  46  32  98  45  39  65
4  47  61  59  91   2  18  34  47
5  99  74  10  76  98  34  39  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [99 74 10 76 98 34 39 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach, such as maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. We aim to assign items in a way that makes the total value received by each agent as equal as possible, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a suggested allocation based on maximizing fairness among agents:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 6 (value 88) to Agent 0.  
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 1 (value 66) and 2 (value 36) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 3 (value 67) and 4 (value 30) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 5 (value 45) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 7 (value 47) to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Assign item 0 (value 99) to Agent 5.

Thus, each agent receives a reasonable value of items, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0]
}
```
