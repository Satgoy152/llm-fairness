Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41   5   2  93  10  43  44  17
1  38   7  22  19  10  61  27  96
2  90  26  73  64  13  78  42  69
3  89  80  84  48  50   3   3  84
4  16  85  83  48  40  11  98  72
5  60   6  74  82  35  17  16   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[41  5  2 93 10 43 44 17]
 [38  7 22 19 10 61 27 96]
 [90 26 73 64 13 78 42 69]
 [89 80 84 48 50  3  3 84]
 [16 85 83 48 40 11 98 72]
 [60  6 74 82 35 17 16  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that all 8 items are allocated. Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance these considerations:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (93). Assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (96). Assign item 7 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (90). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (80). Assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (98). Assign item 6 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 the highest (74). Assign item 2 to agent 5.

Now, we have 2 items left to allocate: items 4 and 5. Let's assign them to maximize the remaining agents' valuations:

7. Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 5 (61). Assign item 5 to agent 1.
8. Agent 4 has a relatively high valuation for item 4 (40) compared to others. Assign item 4 to agent 4.

Given this allocation strategy, here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
