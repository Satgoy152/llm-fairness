Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  34  82  54   4  48  79  75
1  14  72  49  24  47  55   4  16
2  65  40  98  76   3  60  14  74
3  54  15   4  10  23  17  60  71
4  93  57   6  87  49  20  24  33
5  46  66  11  57  58  91   6  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and a total of 8 items are allocated. Here's one way to approach it:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent places on any item.
2. Assign each agent their highest valued item if it hasn't been allocated yet.
3. If conflicts arise (multiple agents want the same item), allocate the item to the agent who values it more.
4. After assigning the highest priority items, allocate remaining items to balance the distribution.

Following this methodology, here are the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6] (82, 79)
- Agent 1: Items [1] (72)
- Agent 2: Items [3] (76)
- Agent 3: Items []
- Agent 4: Item [0] (93)
- Agent 5: Items [5, 4, 7] (91, 58, 16)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations and all 8 items are allocated.

}
