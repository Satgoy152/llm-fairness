Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  36  30  93  65  90  29  24
1  47  36  78  91  91  67  44  14
2  26   5  23  85  45  26  47  51
3  23  40   8  34  34  49  97  48
4  28  99   3   5   3  94  25  14
5  89  28  35   9  32  38  86  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can employ a simple greedy approach. This involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Below is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Start by examining each item and identifying the agent who values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation based on this method:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 7.
- Agent 3 receives item 6.
- Agent 4 receives item 1.
- Agent 5 receives item 0.

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents.
