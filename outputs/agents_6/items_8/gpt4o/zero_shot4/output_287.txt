Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  35  86  74  64   0  39  97
1  94  50   3  93  50  46  94  61
2  73  67   3  47  12  38  56  94
3  68  23  32  27  36  50  22  43
4  60  68  49  69  18   6  98  92
5  36  57  17  83  39  56  71  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that every agent gets a fair share of the items to the best extent possible. Let's go through the process:

1. **Determine the highest value for each item:**
   - Item 0: Highest value is 94 (Agent 1)
   - Item 1: Highest value is 68 (Agent 4)
   - Item 2: Highest value is 86 (Agent 0)
   - Item 3: Highest value is 93 (Agent 1)
   - Item 4: Highest value is 64 (Agent 0)
   - Item 5: Highest value is 56 (Agent 5)
   - Item 6: Highest value is 98 (Agent 4)
   - Item 7: Highest value is 97 (Agent 0)

2. **Allocate items based on the highest bids:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 7
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 3
   - Agent 2: No items (none highest)
   - Agent 3: No items (none highest)
   - Agent 4: Items 1, 6
   - Agent 5: Item 5

3. **Check to ensure each agent is included in the allocation:**
   - In this case, agents 2 and 3 don't receive any items as they don't have the highest valuations for any item.

4. **Ensure a total of 8 items are allocated:**
   - 3 (Agent 0) + 2 (Agent 1) + 0 (Agent 2) + 0 (Agent 3) + 2 (Agent 4) + 1 (Agent 5) = 8 items

Now, let's present the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [5]
}
```
