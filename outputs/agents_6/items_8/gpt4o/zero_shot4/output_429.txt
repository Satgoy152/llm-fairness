Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  43  66  17  95  79  84  23
1  47  46  31  93  62  95  39  76
2  81  56  90  91  98  40  61  99
3  92  67  62  59  68  89  80   9
4  11  92  37   8  95   5  90   7
5  61  21   9  48  48  62  38  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while distributing all 8 items to the agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the items to the agents based on maximizing each agent's total value for the items they receive.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, given there are only 8 items and 6 agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 1 (value 43) to Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 3 (value 93) and 5 (value 95) to Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Allocate item 7 (value 99) to Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Allocate item 0 (value 92) to Agent 3.
- Agent 4: Allocate items 4 (value 95) and 6 (value 90) to Agent 4.
- Agent 5: Allocate item 2 (value 9) to Agent 5.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable allocation based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [2]
}
```
