Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45   0  10  21  66  91  28   0
1  47  22  73  28  82  71  49  78
2  66  11  94  17  35  73  55  44
3  50  50  88  96  34  68  91  74
4  36  45  24  72  64  91   6  14
5  42  92  53  18  96  67  66  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers both the valuations and the need to distribute exactly 8 items. One possible approach is to allocate items to each agent based on their highest valuations to ensure a fair distribution.

Let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: 91 (item 5), 66 (item 4)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: 82 (item 4), 78 (item 7), 73 (item 2)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: 94 (item 2), 73 (item 5)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: 96 (item 3), 91 (item 6), 88 (item 2)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: 91 (item 5), 72 (item 3), 64 (item 4)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Highest valuations: 96 (item 4), 92 (item 1), 67 (item 5)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 5.

Now, let's check the allocation and ensure all items are distributed:

- Items allocated so far: 5, 4, 2, 3, 6, 1
- Remaining items: 0, 7

Allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate item 0, as it is unallocated and provides some value.
- **Agent 1:** Allocate item 7, as it provides a moderate value.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on their valuations, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.
