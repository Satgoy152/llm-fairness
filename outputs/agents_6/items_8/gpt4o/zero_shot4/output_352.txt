Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  54  87  19  34  84  96  67
1  54  62  91  65  23  74   4  12
2  84  84  76  81  19  77  83  51
3  24  80  15   9  22  94  86  39
4  28  83  95  51  60  53  90  95
5  78  22  38  58  26  73  44  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that considers the agents' valuations and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. To achieve this, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent by summing their values for all items.
2. Sort the agents by their total valuation in descending order.
3. Distribute the items to agents based on their sorted order, giving priority to agents with higher total valuations.
4. Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's perform this allocation:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations
- Agent 0: 504
- Agent 1: 385
- Agent 2: 555
- Agent 3: 369
- Agent 4: 555
- Agent 5: 354

### Step 2: Sort by Total Valuation
- Agent 2: 555
- Agent 4: 555
- Agent 0: 504
- Agent 1: 385
- Agent 3: 369
- Agent 5: 354

### Step 3: Distribute Items
We will allocate items to agents giving priority based on their total valuation. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents may receive more than one item.

- Agent 2: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 4: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 0: Item [5]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 5: Item [4]

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents, taking into account their total valuations to the extent possible while ensuring fairness.
