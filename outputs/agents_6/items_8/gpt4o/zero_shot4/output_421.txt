Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94   3  26  91  43  31  28  61
1  78  76  56  57  56  87  33  39
2   3  69  71  91  94  10  35  60
3   8  90   5  85  47  60  73  56
4  99  40  17  66  55  91  29  62
5  51  50  52  55  63  68  15  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. One possible way to achieve this is to assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item, and then adjust the allocations if necessary to ensure all agents receive at least one item.

After analyzing the valuation table, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly, so assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most, so assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most, so assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most, so assign item 3 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 7 highly, so assign item 7 to agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (items 2 and 6) to ensure all items are assigned:

- Agent 2 also values item 2 highly, so assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly, so assign item 6 to agent 3.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
