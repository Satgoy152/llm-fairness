Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  65   4  89  49  60  22  85
1  49  62  27  42  17  54  86  85
2  51  33  82  34  74  81  86  91
3  40  82  46  10  29  49  77  14
4  47  70  49  74  40  90  57  22
5  96  75  72   6  29  92   1  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated in total. We should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents based on their valuations. Here's one way to fairly allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (89) and item 7 (85). Assign these items to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 6 (86). Assign this item to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 7 (91), but it's already taken by agent 0, so assign item 5 (81) to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1 (82). Assign this item to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 5 (90), but it's already taken by agent 2, so assign item 3 (74) to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 0 (96). Assign this item to agent 5.
7. Now, we have assigned 6 items, and need to allocate 2 more.
8. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (82) and item 4 to agent 4 (40).

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This ensures that all items are allocated and the agents receive a fair distribution based on their highest valuations.
