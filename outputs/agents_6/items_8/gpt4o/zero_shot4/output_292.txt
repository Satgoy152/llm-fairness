Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  63  80  93  57  16  46   9
1  56  79  27  89  83   5  17  36
2   2   5  26  95   1  39  29  35
3  24  77   5  70  15  36  35  19
4  56  95  65  63  17  86  30  67
5  18  34   2  85  20   3  31  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, two agents will receive two items each, and the rest will receive one item each.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Determine the highest value for each item:** We will allocate items based on the highest valuation by any agent for each item.

2. **Allocate items:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 32.
   - Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 80.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
   - Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most at 86.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 46.
   - Item 7: Agent 5 values it the most at 92.

Since Agent 0 and Agent 4 have received more items, we need to ensure they are not assigned additional items.

3. **Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item:**

   - Reallocate one item from Agent 0 to an agent without an item. Item 6 is reallocated to Agent 3.
   - Reallocate one item from Agent 4 to an agent without an item. Item 1 is reallocated to Agent 5.

4. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: [0, 2]
   - Agent 1: [4]
   - Agent 2: [3]
   - Agent 3: [6]
   - Agent 4: [5]
   - Agent 5: [1, 7]

Here is the JSON representation of the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
```
