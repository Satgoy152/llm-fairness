Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63   1   0  77  96  57  77  55
1  98  65  46  54  76  43  15  48
2  87  21  33   1  91   0  33  10
3  63   2  98  24   1  70  66  44
4  73  91  52  97   8  21  84  61
5  27  44  85  89  97  87  93  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value for each item across all agents, and assign that item to the corresponding agent.

2. If any agent exceeds the number of items they should receive (on average, each agent should get about 8/6 â‰ˆ 1.33 items), reallocate items to ensure fairness.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 1: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (91).
- Item 2: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 3: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (97).
- Item 4: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (96).
- Item 5: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (87).
- Item 6: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (93).
- Item 7: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (55).

After this initial allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0]
- Agent 2: Items []
- Agent 3: Items [2]
- Agent 4: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 5: Items [5, 6]

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
