Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  96  86  13  91  58  91  13
1  18  14   3  65  25  56  30  63
2  39  12  77  46  61  64  28  86
3   6  19  66  32  58  30  21  98
4  92  25  53  39  79  39  77  34
5  29  28  79  63  20  16  37  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. A possible way to distribute the items is to maximize the total valuation the agents have for the items they receive. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 1 the highest, followed by item 4. Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 3 the highest. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 7 the highest. Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 7 the highest, which is already taken. Their next highest is item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: They value item 0 the highest. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: They value item 2 the highest, which is already taken. Their next highest is item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 5.

This allocation is made by trying to allocate items based on the highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item (except Agent 5 who gets two due to the number of items and agents). The remaining item, item 5, is then given to Agent 5 because it is the next highest available item.

Here are the allocations in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and no agent is left out.
