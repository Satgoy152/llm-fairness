Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  84  86  49  65  62  42  89
1  96   1  18  13  62  91  61   6
2  20  70  31  34   0  49  82   3
3  51  80  11  39  60  95  20  97
4   2  75  14  16  98  35  42   9
5  15  25  82  69  73  17  99  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing them such that each agent gets at least one item while maximizing the total value each agent receives according to their valuations. Given there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest value each agent places on them until all items are allocated.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (valued at 94).
- Agent 1 values item 0 and item 5 highly (valued at 96 and 91 respectively).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (valued at 82).
- Agent 3 values item 7 the most (valued at 97).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (valued at 98).
- Agent 5 values item 6 the most (valued at 99).

Now, let's distribute the items:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value of 96).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (highest value of 95).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (highest value of 99).
4. Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (next highest value of 97).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (highest value of 98).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value of 84).
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (next highest value of 82).
8. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest value of 34).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6, 2]
}
```
