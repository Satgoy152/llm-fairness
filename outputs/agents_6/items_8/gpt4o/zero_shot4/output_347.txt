Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  51  53  14  12  73  14  39
1  81  30  63  93  36  65   5  56
2  86  30  86  64  14  63   3  92
3  39  37  75  54  36  86  69  61
4  46  36  57  54  64  90  65  31
5   2  48  97  67  39  19   3  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Given the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items and all 8 items should be allocated, we'll strategically distribute the items based on the highest valuations.

Let's analyze the preferences and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 5.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 3.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 7.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 5, but since Agent 0 already has it, we'll consider the next highest values.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest value for item 5, but since it's already taken, we'll consider other items.
6. **Agent 5** has the highest value for item 2.

Now, let's allocate items based on the highest remaining valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 2

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 1. Since Agents 0 and 5 have received fewer items than other agents, let's give them the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Items 1 and 2

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 2, 1

Now we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 1]
}
```
