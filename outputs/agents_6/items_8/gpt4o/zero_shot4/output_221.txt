Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  74   7  52  67  87  87  79
1   0  16  75  80  29   8  34  92
2  89  19   7  51   4  42  94  53
3  74   6  54  56  68   8  73  69
4  20  82  31  14  37  26  57  25
5  52  70  11  14  89  45  91  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total value each agent receives. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We aim to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible, taking into account the agents' valuations.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5 and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly, but we'll try to ensure fairness by spreading other items.

Let's allocate based on maximizing individual agent's value:

1. **Agent 0**: [5, 6] (87, 87)
2. **Agent 1**: [3, 7] (80, 92)
3. **Agent 2**: [0] (89)
4. **Agent 3**: [4] (68)
5. **Agent 4**: [1] (82)
6. **Agent 5**: [2] (11)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8. The allocations have been made considering the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```
