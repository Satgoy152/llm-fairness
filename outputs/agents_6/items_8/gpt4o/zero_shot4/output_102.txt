Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  97  25  68  16  93  75  14
1  27   8  66  68   7  76  48  21
2  76   5  18  63   1  46  13  44
3  47   5  51  77  56  33  72  88
4  37   3  80   0  46  17  99  25
5  27  83   7  45  68  28  84  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27  8 66 68  7 76 48 21]
 [76  5 18 63  1 46 13 44]

 [37  3 80  0 46 17 99 25]
 [27 83  7 45 68 28 84 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 6 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuation of the items. One sensible approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. However, we also need to ensure that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than their fair share, given there are more agents than items.

Let's examine the valuations and make optimal assignments:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 76 by agent 2.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 97 by agent 0.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 80 by agent 4.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 77 by agent 3.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 68 by agent 5.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 93 by agent 0.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 99 by agent 4.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 88 by agent 3.

Given these allocations, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7
- Agent 4: Items 2, 6
- Agent 5: Item 4

Now, let's put this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most while ensuring all items are distributed among the agents.
