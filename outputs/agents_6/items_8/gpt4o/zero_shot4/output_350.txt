Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  45  99  35  74  30  48  34
1  38  49  89  33  47  95  21  66
2  21  59  50  80  40  58  29  31
3  90  88  98  41  58  43  90  89
4  19   3  45  96  71  40  45  27
5  74  73  72  20  27  83  92  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent receives a reasonable allocation based on their preferences. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 seems to highly value item 2 (99).
2. Agent 1 seems to highly value item 5 (95).
3. Agent 2 seems to highly value item 3 (80).
4. Agent 3 seems to highly value item 0 (90).
5. Agent 4 seems to highly value item 4 (71).
6. Agent 5 seems to highly value item 7 (95).

Now, we must ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share. Balancing the allocation for remaining items:

- Item 1 (73) can go to Agent 5 who values high.
- Item 6 (48) can go to Agent 0 who values moderately.

This way, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has items, and all 8 items are allocated.
