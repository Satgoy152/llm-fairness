Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  78  82  25  41  45  10  53
1  90  80  26  56  96  90  70  34
2  66  44  41  12  39  30  39   4
3  11  93  96  90  92  74  95  17
4  48  17  71  81  80  46  60  91
5  69  63  24  56  18  75  79  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with a total of 8 items allocated. A common approach to achieve fairness is to aim for a balanced allocation where each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and the allocation maximizes their valuations.

Here's one way to distribute the items fairly based on the given valuations:

1. Assign each agent one item that is most valued by them, if possible.
2. Distribute remaining items based on maximizing total valuation while ensuring fairness.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (Value 82)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (Value 96)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (Value 66)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (Value 90)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (Value 91)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (Value 75)

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (Value 78)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (Value 95)

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction while distributing all items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
