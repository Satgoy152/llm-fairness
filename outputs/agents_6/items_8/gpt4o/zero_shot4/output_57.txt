Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  24  99  54   3  53  48  96
1  58  17  53  88  91   4  20  27
2  97  67  95  16  27  34  86  44
3  24  95  78  53  44  22  33  98
4  64  24  72  57  82  77  59  68
5  51  88  89   6   4  49  17  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent at least one item, if possible, based on their highest valuations to ensure fairness.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on their valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (highest valuation at 99)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (highest valuation at 91)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (highest valuation at 97)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (highest valuation at 98)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (highest valuation at 77)
- Agent 5: Item 1 (highest valuation at 88)
- Remaining items 3 and 6 can be allocated as follows:
  - Agent 1 can take item 3 (second highest valuation at 88)
  - Agent 2 can take item 6 (second highest valuation at 86)

Now, every agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's how the allocations look:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
