Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  31  93  86  48  16   5  40
1  76  60  65  90  53  42   9   0
2  29  48  59  74  36   7  24  95
3  17  87   7  85  90  21  28  23
4  64   6  42  82  61  34  71  78
5  19  68  49  62  63  22  60  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider different methods of allocation such as maximizing each agent's minimum value, maximizing the sum of values, or other fairness criteria. Here, I'll attempt to distribute the items as evenly as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item with a reasonably high value based on their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by identifying the item each agent values the most.
2. Allocate these items to the agents if they are not already taken by a higher priority agent.
3. For remaining items, allocate them to agents who have the least number of items or who value them the most if there are ties.

Here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0], 
    "1": [3],    
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
