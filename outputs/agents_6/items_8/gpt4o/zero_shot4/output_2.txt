Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  39  78  70   9  20  71  53
1  60  28   0  12  35  13  32  34
2  80  73  13  51  75  72  68  61
3  57  48  31  31  50  75   9  21
4  43  76  57   6  28  78  66   1
5   9  31  97  11  36  42  75  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method that ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Allocate the highest valued item to each agent iteratively:**

   - Each agent will be considered for their highest valued item that hasn't been allocated yet.
   - This ensures that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

2. **Continue allocation ensuring all items are distributed:**

   - Once each agent has an item, continue distributing the remaining items to the agents who value them most.

Let's perform this allocation:

1. Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 80).
2. Agent 4 gets item 5 (value 78).
3. Agent 5 gets item 2 (value 97).
4. Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 71).
5. Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 35).
6. Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 31).
7. Agent 2 gets item 1 (value 73), as they have the second-highest value for it (after 4).
8. Agent 0 gets item 7 (value 53), as they have the next highest value for it.

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are distributed fairly based on their valuations.
