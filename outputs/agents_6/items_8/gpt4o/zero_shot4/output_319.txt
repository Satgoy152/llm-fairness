Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  11  69  97  55  49  47  18
1  22  43  82  61  66  89  62  12
2   6  32  45  15  73  79  61  39
3  86  42  51  36  24  15  72  48
4  90  83  44  34  11  87  14  92
5  13  67  64   0  88  34  90   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. The goal is to maximize fairness, possibly by maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 3
   - Total Valuation: 90 + 97 = 187

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 5, 2
   - Total Valuation: 89 + 82 = 171

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 4
   - Total Valuation: 73

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 6
   - Total Valuation: 72

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: 7
   - Total Valuation: 92

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Items: 1
   - Total Valuation: 67

This allocation method attempts to distribute the items so that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring all items are distributed without leaving any agent out. 

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```
