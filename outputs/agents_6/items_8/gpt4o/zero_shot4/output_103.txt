Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36   2  57   3  38  99  18  44
1  89  80  78  91  30   1  47  68
2  71  27  11  65  82  49  94  17
3   8  15  60  18  66  79  43  49
4  98  22  38  17  85  86  79   8
5  78   2  54  39  30  37  46  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will try to distribute the items so that the overall allocation is balanced in terms of value.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for agent 0 are for items 5 (99) and 2 (57). We'll allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values for agent 1 are for items 3 (91) and 0 (89). We'll allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values for agent 2 are for items 6 (94) and 4 (82). We'll allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values for agent 3 are for items 5 (79) and 4 (66). Since item 5 is already allocated, we'll allocate item 4 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest values for agent 4 are for items 0 (98) and 5 (86). Since item 0 is very high and not allocated yet, we'll allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest values for agent 5 are for items 0 (78) and 2 (54). Since item 0 is already allocated, we can allocate item 2 to agent 5.

Now, let's assign the remaining items:
- Items left: 1 and 7.

We can distribute these remaining items based on the next highest values for agents that have fewer items:

7. **Agent 1**: Can take item 1 (80) as it is the next highest available value.
8. **Agent 3**: Can take item 7 (49) which is their next highest available value.

Now, we have allocated all 8 items. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```

Every agent has at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.
