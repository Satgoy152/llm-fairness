Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  46  81  11  12  68  44  67
1  78  22  37  76  29  41  90   9
2  54  22  46  47   4  38  77  20
3  78  62  33  38  94  75  30  11
4  49  68  77  95  52  10  87  68
5  44  15  39  43  59  31  24  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while also trying to ensure fairness.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 (81) and 5 (68). Assign items 2 and 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0 (78) and 6 (90). Assign items 0 and 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** does not have particularly high valuations compared to others, so we look at remaining items. Assign item 3 (47) to Agent 2 since it has a relatively higher value for it.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for item 4 (94). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 3 (95) and 6 (87) but both are already assigned. Assign item 7 (68) to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has moderate valuations, but since items are limited, assign item 1 (15) to Agent 5 to ensure all items are allocated.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents in a way that respects their preferences as much as possible while ensuring fairness.
