Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  76  41   0   0  48  85   9
1  60  79  21  43  54  78   9  41
2  87  70   6  57  46  72  17  50
3  67  64  46  58  73  95  42  46
4  21  75  63  37  18  14  38  86
5  53  73  67  59  78  57  79  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 8 items among the 6 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. However, since there are more agents than items, some agents will inevitably receive no items. Let's aim to maximize the overall perceived value by the agents:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 6, so we can allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 5, so we can allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 highly (but it's already taken), so item 3, which is also valued decently, can be allocated to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 5 (but it's taken), so we can allocate item 4, which is the next highest.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 highly, so we can allocate this to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values items 4 and 7 highly (but both are taken), so we can allocate items 1 and 2, which are next highest according to the remaining available items.

Based on the above reasoning, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to maximize total value while ensuring all items are fairly distributed.
