Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88   0  56  49   1  34  41  36
1  94  46  99  93  90  39  61  76
2  34  72   3  27  23  81  31  65
3  20  71  14  38   3   1  72  69
4  92  68  46  92  46  34  45  68
5  31  32  72  96  52  62  28   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. Given the valuations, we aim to assign items in a way that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Let's start by looking at the highest valuations for each item and assign items to agents with those valuations. We'll ensure each agent gets a chance to receive at least one item, considering the total number of items (8) and agents (6).

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest (94).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest (72).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest (99).
4. Item 3: Agent 5 values it the highest (96).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest (90).
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest (81).
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it the highest (72).
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it (68), and it's the highest available.

Now, let's balance it so that each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: 
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [1, 5]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [3]

This allocation balances the number of items each agent receives while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on the provided valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3]
}
```
