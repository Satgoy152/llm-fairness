Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  91  23  42  56  85  58  29
1  81   4  66  18  24  67  43  75
2  40  74  84   5  42  92  51  21
3  54  92   9  84  32   2  30  95
4  74  97  41  10  46  61  63  58
5   1  50  22   2   8  28  56  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 81).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 97).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 84).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 84).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 56).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 92).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 63).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 3 (value 95).

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation assigns each item to the agent who values it most highly, ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.
