Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  45  54  76  68   0  38  53
1  91  38  81  75  21  69  14  84
2  67  61  83  83  53   2  66  84
3  79  36  23  97   4  22  53  55
4  66  54  67  92  13  90  93  60
5  19  68  91  78  40   3  62  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, let's try to distribute the items by considering the valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We will aim to maximize the total value of allocations. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If there's a tie, we can make a choice to ensure all items are allocated.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, adjusting allocations as needed.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (91), so it goes to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 5 values it the most (68), so it goes to Agent 5.
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most (91), so it goes to Agent 5.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (97), so it goes to Agent 3.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (68), so it goes to Agent 0.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most (90), so it goes to Agent 4.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most (93), so it goes to Agent 4.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (84), so it goes to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation meets the requirements of distributing all 8 items and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
