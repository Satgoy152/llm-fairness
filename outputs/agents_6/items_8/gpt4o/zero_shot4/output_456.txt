Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  25   6   4  51  96  66  63
1  63  95  97  47  58  68  15  93
2  56  94   0  53   5  63   5  89
3  69  43  39  36  10  10  99  72
4  99  73  72   5   9  60  43  91
5  33  14  60  28  91  62  85  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [99 73 72  5  9 60 43 91]
 [33 14 60 28 91 62 85 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction or valuation of the items for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and exactly 8 items are allocated in total. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 (value 96) and item 0 (value 89).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2 (value 97).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 7 (value 89).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 (value 99).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4 (value 9).
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 3 (value 28) and item 1 (value 14).

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents with each agent receiving a fair share based on the highest values they have for the items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 1]
}
```
