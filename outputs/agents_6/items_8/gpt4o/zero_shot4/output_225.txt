Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  94  28  82  49  60  59  97
1  41  72  41   9  25  39  53  30
2   8  97  11  60  66  64   5  21
3  61  92  72  90  10  16  35  29
4  29  38  46  56  31  69  47  47
5  55   3  72  27   6  18  98  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value most, ensuring that each item is only given to one agent and all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. If any items remain unallocated after step 2, allocate them to agents based on the next highest valuations.

Following this plan, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for items 1 and 7.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 2.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3.
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 5.
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 6.

Now, we ensure each agent gets at least one item and allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0: [1, 7]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [0, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```
