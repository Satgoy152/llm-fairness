Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  82  24  52  76  63  14   6
1  31  94  33  57  66  61  20  39
2  78  75  74  76  73  43  86  85
3  20  36  82  60  52  69  85  98
4  38  13  13  66  21  19  83  87
5  93  75  16  80  66  87   8  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation across all agents is as balanced as possible, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the constraints, let's analyze the table and perform an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 (82) and 4 (76).
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 (94) the most, followed by item 3 (57).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0 (78), 3 (76), and 6 (86).
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 2 (82), 6 (85), and 7 (98).
5. **Agent 4** values items 6 (83) and 7 (87) highly.
6. **Agent 5** has high valuations for items 0 (93), 3 (80), and 5 (87).

By examining these preferences and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Give Agent 0 items 4 and 1 as they value them highly.
- Assign Agent 1 item 3, which they value significantly.
- Allocate Agent 2 item 6, where they have one of the highest valuations.
- Assign Agent 3 item 7, given their high valuation for it.
- Give Agent 4 item 2, ensuring they receive an item.
- Allocate Agent 5 items 0 and 5 based on their high valuations.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```
