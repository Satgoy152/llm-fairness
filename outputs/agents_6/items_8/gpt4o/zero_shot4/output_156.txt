Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  99  42  39   4  39  19  11
1   4  64  89  50  48  57  37  90
2  53  65  99  18  93  90  62  58
3  32  83  69  78  88  73  67  86
4  68  29  48  46   4  32  36  73
5   6  79  68  77  35  87  96  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a valuation-based approach. One simple method is to allocate items one by one to the agent who values the item the most and hasn't yet received an item. We should ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, and then distribute any remaining items based on maximizing total valuation.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most (68).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (99).
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (99).
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (78).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (93).
6. Item 5: Agent 5 values it the most (87).
7. Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (96).
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (90).

Now, let's ensure that every agent has been assigned at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items [1]
- Agent 1: Items [7]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [0]
- Agent 5: Items [5, 6]

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
