Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23   3  45  79  50  98  81  32
1  57  44   8  12  33  47  76  45
2  39  31  67  46  73  80  26  25
3  16  22  76  95  72  57  30  32
4  37  78  51  61  37  46  45  98
5  69  48  98  21  42   1  24  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Since there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 has a balanced valuation for item 6.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 4 has a strong preference for item 7.
- Agent 5 values item 0 highly.

Using this heuristic, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are fairly distributed among the agents.
