Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  87  59  53  99  38  20  23
1  76  79  70   8  42  51  39  81
2  31  37  42   9  95  55  57   0
3  17  95  20  78  19  29  22   1
4  86  33  74  31   5   5  63  74
5  66  83  56  85  32  53  44  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. However, since there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (value 86).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 95).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (value 74).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 5 (value 85).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 99).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 55).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 57).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value 81).

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and the total valuation is maximized given the constraints.
