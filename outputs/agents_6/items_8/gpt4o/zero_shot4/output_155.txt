Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  45  63  25  99  30   9   2
1  40  40  71  71  55  25  20  94
2  95  66  18  35  27  66  61  25
3  48  57  71  37  37  93  17  79
4  73  15  62  62  66  11  72  89
5  14   9  59  88  77  45  46  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that all 8 items are allocated and no agent receives more than their fair share. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Begin by identifying which items are highly valued by each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Adjust allocations as needed to ensure all items are distributed fairly.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given table:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 99.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the highest at 94.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 95.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 93.
- Agent 4 values item 7, but it's already allocated, so item 6 at 72 is their next preference.
- Agent 5 values item 3 at 88.

Let's now allocate the items:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 5.

We have now allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (1 and 2). 

- Agent 0 has at least one item. Based on the next highest remaining value, allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value of 66).
- Agent 4 has one item. Based on the next highest remaining value, allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value of 71).

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are fairly distributed based on valuations.
