Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  78  94   6  80  12  47  29
1  61  61  16  58  77  67   3  99
2  81  39  31  66  86  70   8  13
3  68  33  66  92  54  98  84  55
4  58  64  45  12  98  12  19  50
5  20  78  42  96  71  27  84  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives some items according to their valuations, trying to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness. Since there are eight items and six agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We can use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items to maximize individual satisfaction as much as possible. 

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Allocate items based on the highest individual valuations, giving each agent one item in descending order of their highest valued item.
2. Re-evaluate any remaining items and allocate to those with the highest remaining valuation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Agent 0 receives item 2 (highest value: 94)
2. Agent 3 receives item 5 (highest value: 98)
3. Agent 1 receives item 7 (highest value: 99)
4. Agent 2 receives item 4 (highest value: 86)
5. Agent 5 receives item 3 (highest value: 96)
6. Agent 4 receives item 1 (highest value: 64)

The remaining items (0 and 6) will be allocated to the agents with the second highest valuation for those items:

7. Agent 2 receives item 0 (second-highest value: 81)
8. Agent 5 receives item 6 (second highest value: 84)

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated in total, while trying to maximize the utility for each agent based on their individual preferences.
