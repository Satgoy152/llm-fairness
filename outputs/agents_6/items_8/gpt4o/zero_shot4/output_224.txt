Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71   8  91  39  48  74  49  68
1  59  80   2  63  26   6  68  39
2  78  90   0  64  45  57  97  38
3  41  92  36   3  88  93  96  62
4  21  54  17  86  86  29  85  40
5  29  78  86   8  33  85  50   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll try to balance this as evenly as possible while considering their valuations.

First, let's determine a strategy to allocate items fairly:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations.

After analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 6.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1, 5, and 6.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 5 has high valuations for items 2 and 5.

We'll allocate items in a way to ensure each agent receives at least one valuable item, balancing the total allocations.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [1, 5]
- Agent 4: [3, 4]
- Agent 5: []

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent based on their individual preferences.

Finally, in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": []
}
```
