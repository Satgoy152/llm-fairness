Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  23  43  90  50  65  13  55
1  24  52  23  76  55   1   1  33
2  10  45  58  99  66   3  22  63
3  39  68  75  21  51  64  22  94
4  42   5  92  69  85  82  42  49
5  72  19  37  23  14  47  48  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [72 19 37 23 14 47 48 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can use a strategy to balance the total valuation each agent receives. One common approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's see how we can distribute these items fairly:

1. First, let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. If there are more items than agents, we continue assigning items to the agents with the highest valuations for those items.

Hereâ€™s an allocation that tries to balance these factors:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (72) 
- Item 1: Agent 3 (68)
- Item 2: Agent 4 (92)
- Item 3: Agent 2 (99)
- Item 4: Agent 4 (85)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (65)
- Item 6: Agent 5 (48)
- Item 7: Agent 3 (94)

Here's the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

Each item is allocated to the agent who values it highly, while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share.
