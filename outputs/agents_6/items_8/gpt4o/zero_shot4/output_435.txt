Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45   0  24  75  52   2  76  12
1  73  67  22  44  26  28  41  36
2  10  62   2  27  86  50  11  90
3  73   3   4  94  53  12  18  60
4  16  74  23  27  77  90  86  21
5  89  35  73   9  48  23  36  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider assigning items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. List the items in order of highest valuation by any agent.
2. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most, provided that agent does not already have an item unless all other agents have at least one.
3. Repeat this process until all items are allocated.

Following this method, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 4, 1]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives item 7.
- Agent 3 receives item 6.
- Agent 4 receives item 5.
- Agent 5 receives items 2, 4, and 1.

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item where possible, and total allocations remain fair based on highest individual value.
