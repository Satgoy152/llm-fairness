Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  64  20  91  77  67  30  63
1  11  40  70  97  49  66  58  93
2  14  44  49  99  92  52  46  16
3  43  50  74  27  19   5  53  57
4  22  41  38  10  56  81   7  39
5  71  26  51  45  39  36  96  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can follow a process that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to iteratively assign items to the agent with the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item until all items are distributed.

Let's process the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (91)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (97) [Already allocated]
   - Next highest value: Item 7 (93)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (99) [Already allocated]
   - Next highest value: Item 4 (92)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (74)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (81)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 6 (96)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 5.

After these allocations, the remaining unallocated items are 0 and 1. We need to distribute these to the agents who have received the least valuable items or who have fewer items, ensuring fairness.

- **Item 0**: Highest value remains with Agent 0 (83), but we can consider other agents.
  - Agent 5 has a high value (71) and only one item, allocate item 0 to Agent 5.

- **Item 1**: Remaining item.
  - Agent 0 has a high value (64) and only one item, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6, 0]
}
```
