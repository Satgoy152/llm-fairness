Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  79  14   2  88  86  84  16
1  33  98  76  19  12  48  57  98
2  61  92   9  15  81  65  11  32
3  56  54  33  83  91  43  38  14
4  25  83  25  35  84  12  45  51
5  81  95  18  19  87  29  70  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none. The goal is to allocate items in a way that is perceived as fair based on the given valuations.

Let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items with highest valuations: 4 (88), 5 (86), and 6 (84)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items with highest valuations: 1 (98), 7 (98)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item with highest valuation: 1 (92), but it's already taken
   - Next highest unique valuation: 0 (61)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item with highest valuations: 4 (91), but it's already taken
   - Next highest unique valuation: 3 (83)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item with highest valuation: 4 (84), but it's already taken
   - Next highest unique valuation: 1 (83), but it's already taken
   - Next highest unique valuation: 7 (51)
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 4

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Items with highest valuations: 1 (95), but it's already taken
   - Next highest unique valuation: 0 (81), but it's already taken
   - Next highest unique valuation: 4 (87), but it's already taken
   - Remaining: 2 (18), 5 (29), 6 (70)
   - Assign items 5 and 6 to Agent 5

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction while considering the constraints. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
