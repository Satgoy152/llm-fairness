Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  98  53  69   4  19  83  61
1  78  88  59  67  34   8  10  27
2   3  22  32  11  63  74  72  89
3  77  40  77  77  36   9  66  44
4  75   5  86  94  83   8  56  54
5  76  73  31  64  34  25  24  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their individual valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the highest valued items for each agent and start allocating them one by one, taking care not to allocate more than one item to each agent initially.

Here's one way to allocate:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0 and 1. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 0 and 1. Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 7 and 5. Allocate item 7 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has high values for items 0 and 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 has high values for items 3 and 2. Allocate item 3 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 has high values for items 0 and 1. Allocate item 5 to agent 5.

Now, each agent has 1 item, and we've allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

2. Allocate the remaining items:

- Item 6 is highly valued by agent 0 and 2. Allocate item 6 to agent 0.
- Item 4 is highly valued by agent 2 and 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest values for each agent and tries to distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.
