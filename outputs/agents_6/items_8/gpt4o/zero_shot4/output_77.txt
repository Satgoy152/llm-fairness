Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  24  91  86  23  89  23   4
1  15   5  13  66   2  16  42  83
2  47  84  23  76  41  75  62  79
3  21  63  30  17  50  51  65   6
4  97  38  85  65  85   3  24   0
5  79  73  31  84  73  63  41  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives the items they value the most, while also attempting to balance the total value of items each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent across all items, to get an idea of which items are more valuable to each agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the total allocations amount to exactly 8 items.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is exactly 8.
