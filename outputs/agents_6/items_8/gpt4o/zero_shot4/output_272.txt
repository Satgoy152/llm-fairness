Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  11  86   0  36   3  13  11
1  79  49  63  36  76  49  81  77
2  56  65  98  61  97  37  18  76
3  66  82  20   7  14  18  16  57
4  41  92  66  90  51   2  10  72
5  63  73  25  34  28   9  67  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 11 86  0 36  3 13 11]
 [79 49 63 36 76 49 81 77]
 [56 65 98 61 97 37 18 76]

 [41 92 66 90 51  2 10 72]
 [63 73 25 34 28  9 67 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to balance the allocations in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 2.  
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.  
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 and 7.  
4. Agent 3 has a good valuation for item 1.  
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 3.  
6. Agent 5 can have item 5.  

Based on this, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 6]
- Agent 2: [4, 7]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [5]

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```
