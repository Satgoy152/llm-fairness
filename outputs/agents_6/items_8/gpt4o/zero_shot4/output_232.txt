Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  61  37  65  14  20  90  56
1   8  40  26  70   6  77  29  86
2   7  46  16  16  35  68  28   1
3  90  17  20  16  93  77  31  40
4  94  16  14  39  84  63  59  99
5  69  62   6  10  50   2  57  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences. This can be achieved using a greedy approach, where we allocate items to agents based on the highest value they assign to those items, ensuring that each item is only assigned once.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. List all the items with their values for each agent.
2. Sort these item-agent pairs in descending order based on the valuation.
3. Allocate items to agents starting from the highest value, ensuring each item is only assigned once.
4. Continue until all items are allocated.

Based on this approach, here is a possible allocation:

1. Item 6 is allocated to Agent 0 (value 90).
2. Item 4 is allocated to Agent 3 (value 93).
3. Item 7 is allocated to Agent 4 (value 99).
4. Item 0 is allocated to Agent 4 (value 94).
5. Item 1 is allocated to Agent 0 (value 61).
6. Item 5 is allocated to Agent 1 (value 77).
7. Item 3 is allocated to Agent 1 (value 70).
8. Item 2 is allocated to Agent 0 (value 37).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7, 0],
    "5": []
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items based on maximizing their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed.
