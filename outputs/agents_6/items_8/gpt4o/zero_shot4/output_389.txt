Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  78  92  29  20  57  75  13
1  68   1   6  72  25   5  21  45
2  97  26  11  29  93  62  26  68
3  69  11  55  91  43  62  65  23
4  74  28  29  84  79  34  58  28
5  29  47  95  33  65  28  13   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This involves a balance between the total value each agent receives and the number of items they get. Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Has high valuations for item 2 (92) and item 1 (78).
   - Allocate items 2 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation for item 3 (72).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (97).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation for item 3 is already taken. Next highest valuation is item 5 (62).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 is taken, next for item 4 (79).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Highest valuation for item 2 is taken, next for item 6 (13).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 5.

7. **Final Allocation:**
   - Only item 7 is left, which can be allocated to Agent 1 as they have a reasonable valuation (45).

Now, let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
