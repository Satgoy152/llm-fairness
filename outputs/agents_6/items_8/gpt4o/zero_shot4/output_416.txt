Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59   1  68  37  56  52  53  12
1  25  75  65   4  66  93  22  22
2   1  61  57  12  85  24  89  58
3   0  38  41  44  91  35  64  79
4  61  51  18  90  89  61  13  55
5  27  26  37  74  64  77  95  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations for the items. We will try to ensure each agent gets items they value highly, while also ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 2 (68).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 5 (93).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 6 (89).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 4 (91).
- Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 3 (90).
- Agent 5: Highest valuation is for item 6 (95).

Based on the highest valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 gets item 2.
2. Agent 1 gets item 5.
3. Agent 2 gets item 6.
4. Agent 3 gets item 4.
5. Agent 4 gets item 3.
6. Agent 5 gets item 7.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items. Let's consider the next highest valuations:

- Item 0: Allocate to Agent 0 (valuation 59).
- Item 1: Allocate to Agent 1 (valuation 75).

Now every item is allocated, and every agent receives at least one item. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7]
}
```
