Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  50   7  64  81  56  18  75
1  22   6  34  43  94  94  37  13
2  47  87   5   9  77  75  60  53
3  73  41  87   8  31  43  85  92
4  37  70  80  20  45  60  64  89
5   5  78   4  50  14  76  75  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated. We will attempt to distribute the items to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Assign item 4 (value 81) and item 0 (value 46) to agent 0. Total valuation: 127.
2. Assign item 5 (value 94) and item 3 (value 43) to agent 1. Total valuation: 137.
3. Assign item 6 (value 60) and item 1 (value 87) to agent 2. Total valuation: 147.
4. Assign item 7 (value 92) to agent 3. Total valuation: 92.
5. Assign item 2 (value 80) to agent 4. Total valuation: 80.
6. Assign no items to agent 5. Total valuation: 0.

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed among the agents while trying to maximize the valuations. Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```
