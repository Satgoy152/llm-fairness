Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  66  12  43  47  22  80  41
1  44   0  79   4  42  65  92  73
2  79  58   0  48   7   9  89  13
3  61  45  75  69  76  29   9  93
4  19  16  61   0  61  41  97  96
5  53  60  12  71  24  37  93  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives the items they value the most, while ensuring that all 8 items are allocated. Given the constraint of fairness, it's important to consider that each agent should ideally receive at least one item of significant value to them if possible.

Let's begin by examining the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (80).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (92).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (79).
- Agent 3 values item 7 the most (93).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (97).
- Agent 5 values item 6 the most (93).

Items to prioritize:
- Item 6 is highly valued by agents 0, 1, 4, and 5.
- Item 7 is highly valued by agent 3.
- Item 0 is highly valued by agent 2.

Given the overlap for item 6, we must decide based on second preferences and balance allocation:

Allocation strategy:
1. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (highest valuation).
2. Assign item 7 to agent 3 (highest valuation).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (highest valuation).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 5 (second-highest valuation for agent 5).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (second-highest valuation for agent 3).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 5 (third-highest valuation for agent 5).
7. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (second-highest valuation for agent 0).
8. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (another high valuation).

The goal is to distribute items with consideration to each agent's preferences and ensuring that all 8 items are allocated fairly. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7, 2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
