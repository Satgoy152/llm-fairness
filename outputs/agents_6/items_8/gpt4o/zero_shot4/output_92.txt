Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  75  34  84  53  77  52  23
1  74   8  90  28  35  29  86  77
2   2   7  41  11  48  63  83  63
3   3  85  32  86  92  31   7  16
4  52  83  72  78  23  94  82  84
5  61  97  47  67  20  27  96  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we'll aim to distribute the items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will start by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation item is 3 (value = 84).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation item is 2 (value = 90).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation item is 6 (value = 83).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation item is 4 (value = 92).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation item is 5 (value = 94).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation item is 1 (value = 97).

Now, we have assigned 6 items, and each agent has received one item. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items. Let's continue by looking at the next highest available valuations:

7. **Remaining items**: Items 0 and 7 are unallocated.
   - **Item 0**: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 1 (value = 74).
   - **Item 7**: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 4 (value = 84).

Thus, based on the above allocation strategy, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [1]
}
```
