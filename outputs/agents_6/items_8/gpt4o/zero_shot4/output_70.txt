Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  36  70  51  86  32  90  96
1  87  68  22  91   0  96  55  73
2  24   0  27  20  40  15  81  97
3  16  36  69  33  74  73  95  59
4   4  19  85  68  89  56  99   4
5   4  14  98  70  32   3  26  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. We will attempt to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring fairness.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 6 (value 90)
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 5 (value 96)
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 7 (value 97)
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 4 (value 74)
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 2 (value 85)
6. **Agent 5**: Receives item 3 (value 70)
7. **Agent 0**: Also receives item 0 (value 55)
8. **Agent 1**: Also receives item 1 (value 68)

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with the focus on maximizing the total value each agent can derive from their allocated items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
