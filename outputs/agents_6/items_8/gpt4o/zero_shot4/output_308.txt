Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  24  64  28  44  50  95  30
1  42  14  27  59  42  92  93  48
2  72  82  84  35  33  35  72  70
3   0  27  69  54  86  56  14  15
4  14   8  16  50   2   1  18  91
5   2  39  82  82  55  92  48  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach to fair allocation is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 6 and 2.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 7.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 3.

By assigning items based on these high valuations, we attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

Allocation:
- Agent 0: [6] (total valuation 95)
- Agent 1: [5] (total valuation 92)
- Agent 2: [1, 2] (total valuation 82 + 84 = 166)
- Agent 3: [4] (total valuation 86)
- Agent 4: [7] (total valuation 91)
- Agent 5: [3, 0] (total valuation 82 + 2 = 84)

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3, 0]
}
```
