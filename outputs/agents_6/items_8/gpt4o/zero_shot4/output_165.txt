Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  51  55  17  69  84  40  44
1  43  79   5   3  52  54   9  76
2  25  40  22  58  95  99  24  81
3  16  96  49  70  64  28   7  29
4  73   3  17  78  93  30  97  77
5  92  52  18  45  20  84  62  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences. Here is a possible allocation strategy for the given scenario:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 5 (84) and 4 (69).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 1 (79) and 7 (76).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for items 5 (99) and 4 (95).
   - Agent 3: Highest values are for items 1 (96) and 3 (70).
   - Agent 4: Highest values are for items 4 (93) and 6 (97).
   - Agent 5: Highest values are for items 0 (92) and 5 (84).

2. **Distribute Items Based on Preferences:**
   - Assign each agent their top preference without conflicts. If there are multiple agents interested in the same item, consider the next highest value for conflicting agents or items with no conflict.

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4
   - Agent 1: Item 7
   - Agent 2: Item 5
   - Agent 3: Item 1
   - Agent 4: Item 6
   - Agent 5: Items 0, 3
   - Item 2 is unassigned, and Agent 0 has a relatively high value for it, so assign it to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is 8.
