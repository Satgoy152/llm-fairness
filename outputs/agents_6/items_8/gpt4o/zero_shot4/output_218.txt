Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  97  63  55  23  52  69  42
1  92  48  31  39  42  56  96  85
2  57  55  55  48  80  17  26  94
3  12  10  38  53  20  53  57  56
4  35  42  70  24   0  31  56  27
5  67  86  61  33  61  46  43  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. The goal is to ensure an equitable distribution where no agent feels significantly undervalued. 

Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 7, so allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a relatively balanced valuation, so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 5, so allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, there are two items remaining to be allocated: items 4 and 6.

7. Agent 2 has a reasonably high valuation for item 4, allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
8. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 6, allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items based on high valuations while ensuring equitable distribution among the agents.
