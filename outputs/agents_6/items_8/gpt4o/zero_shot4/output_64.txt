Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  82   2  57  65  74  20  51
1   6  75   8  48  92  89  51  76
2  24  32  29  31  89  43  65  54
3  41  24  77  19   1  97  39  61
4   1  21  18  69  19  26  99  14
5  25  83  25  90  71  49  68  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We'll proceed by assigning items one by one to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Item 0 (value 25) is allocated to Agent 0.
2. Item 1 (value 83) is allocated to Agent 5.
3. Item 2 (value 77) is allocated to Agent 3.
4. Item 3 (value 90) is allocated to Agent 5.
5. Item 4 (value 92) is allocated to Agent 1.
6. Item 5 (value 97) is allocated to Agent 3.
7. Item 6 (value 99) is allocated to Agent 4.
8. Item 7 (value 76) is allocated to Agent 1.

Based on the above allocations, the JSON format will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
