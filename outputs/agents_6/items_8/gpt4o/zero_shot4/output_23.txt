Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  16  51  74  85  93  27   7
1  32  94  22  28  37  27  14  89
2  40  48  15  96  43  54  17  37
3  61  41  80  58  36  28  30  67
4   3  42  44  14  24  35  66   5
5  17  91   1  78  43  90  41  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that the distribution is equitable, with each agent receiving an integer number of items and all 8 items being allocated. Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (93).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (94).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (96).
- Agent 3 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 (80).
- Agent 4 doesn't have a standout high value but item 6 is the highest for them (66).
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 4 (43).

Based on these valuations, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives item 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 7.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.
- Agent 4 receives item 6.
- Agent 5 receives items 0 and 4.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed.
