Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  60  73  62  36  61   7  48
1  81  13   0  64  63  26  48  35
2  62   1   4   7  63  39  20  18
3  62  41  47  31  86  90  63  96
4  37  44  39  93  59  88  63  97
5   0  72  73  58  50  88  41  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. A simple heuristic approach we can use here is to allocate each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

First, let's look at each item and determine which agent values it the most:

- Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 1 (81)
- Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 5 (72)
- Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 0 and Agent 5 (73)
- Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 4 (93)
- Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 3 (86)
- Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 3 (90)
- Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 3 (63)
- Item 7: Highest value is by Agent 4 (97)

Now, let's allocate the items ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (81)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 5 (72)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (73) - since Agent 5 already has item 1
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (93)
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (86)
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (90) - Agent 3 has high value for two items
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (20) - since other agents already have higher-valued items
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (97)

Letâ€™s present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [3, 7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while maximizing the total valuation each agent receives.
