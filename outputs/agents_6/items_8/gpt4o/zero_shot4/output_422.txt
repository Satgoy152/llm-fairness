Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  45  90  13  30  15  93  14
1  51  41  54  69  25   3  50   1
2  88  81   6  49  18  70  40  77
3  97  85  54  30  32  20  74  66
4  47  14  10  20  72  10  32  94
5  22  61  34  83   2  62  39  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can take a look at the valuations and try to assign the items to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most but ensure that each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. For item 0, agent 3 has the highest valuation (97).
2. For item 1, agent 3 also has the highest valuation (85).
3. For item 2, agent 0 has the highest valuation (90).
4. For item 3, agent 5 has the highest valuation (83).
5. For item 4, agent 4 has the highest valuation (72).
6. For item 5, agent 2 has the highest valuation (70).
7. For item 6, agent 0 has the highest valuation (93).
8. For item 7, agent 4 has the highest valuation (94).

Based on these allocations, we can create the JSON output:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and maximizes the satisfaction of the agents according to their valuations, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Note that agent 1 does not receive any items in this allocation, which can happen in this scenario based on the valuations and item availability.
