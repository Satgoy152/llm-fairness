Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  66  56  59  30  92  16  25
1  20   3  20  70   4  33  97  68
2  38  44  51  16  48  25   8  37
3  72  18  55  93  53  71  42  72
4  70  65   2  84  63  15  98  69
5  47  68  47  66  77   1  47  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the values each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm focusing on each agent's highest-value items first. Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for item 5 (92) and item 3 (59).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 6 (97).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 2 (51).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 3 (93).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 6 (98).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 4 (77).

Now, we will allocate items considering these values with the constraint that each agent can get an integer number of items:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5.

This covers 5 items. Now allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest value for Agent 3).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 5 (next highest value for Agent 5).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (next highest value for Agent 4).

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
