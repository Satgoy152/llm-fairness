Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  87  66  73  50  13  86  52
1  30  10  80  18  52  16  60   4
2  80   2  18  26  16  83  78  59
3  47  66  81  70  64  36  62  12
4  44  22  65  55  70  16  99  11
5  88  24  27  10   8  44  44  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility based on the given valuations. The goal is to distribute the items so that the total value received by all agents is as high as possible while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. Let's allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

   - Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most (88).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (87).
   - Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (81).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (73).
   - Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most (70).
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (83).
   - Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most (99).
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (59).

2. After assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed.
