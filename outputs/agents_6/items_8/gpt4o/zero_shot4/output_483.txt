Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  32  85  24  90  63  52  79
1  68  89  66   4  16  47  53  75
2  62  90  35  69  52  59  48   2
3  74   0  63  52  47  55  44  72
4  37  30  76  35  88  97  64  37
5  66  47  95  33  78  47  30  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives. This approach ensures that the items are allocated to those who value them the most, while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents may receive more than one item while others may receive only one or none.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (93), item 2 (85), and item 4 (90).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (89).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (69).
4. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 5 (97).
5. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 6 (30).
6. Item 7 is best assigned to Agent 3 with a value of 72.

This initial allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, thus maximizing overall satisfaction.

Hereâ€™s the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all items to agents based on maximizing their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
