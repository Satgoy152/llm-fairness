Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91   0  84  90  89  90  32  74
1  14  86  42  91  43  85   8  69
2  30   1  45  61   6  35  34  67
3  73  41  76  48  69  98  54  78
4   3   6  83  84  16  43  40  51
5   4  32  45  56  40  26   3   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 seems to have high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3.
3. Agent 2 doesn't have particularly high valuations but can be assigned items with lower competition.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 2.
6. Agent 5 can take the remaining items.

Considering these points, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes their valuations as much as possible.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```
