Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  13  28  31  14  75   3  93
1  48  26  65  28  31  32  68   3
2  39  47  95  75   7  54  99  69
3   5  99  47  97  51  52  79  72
4  98  27   9  84  55  23  79  48
5  40  68  96  93  90  29  95  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can use a simple allocation strategy that aims to distribute the items based on the highest valuations to ensure fairness. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify Agent Preferences**: List each agent's highest valued items.
2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 98.
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 99.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 95.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 97.
- **Item 4**: Agent 5 values it the highest at 90.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 75.
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 99.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 93.

Let's ensure that every agent has been considered. If some agents do not receive any items, we may need to adjust slightly to ensure fairness. However, the above allocation is based on maximizing the value for each item.

Now, let's write the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it most highly, while also distributing the items fairly across the agents.
