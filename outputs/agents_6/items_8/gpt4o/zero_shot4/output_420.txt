Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  71  88  25   2  81  20  89
1  25  94  93  23   3  55  56  55
2  16  87  61  77  85  18   4  55
3  75  53   5  63  71  39  79  32
4  35   9   7  35   7   4  17  94
5  51  20  19  76  60  91  36  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their valuations. Since we have 6 agents and 8 items, each agent should get at least 1 item, and 2 agents will receive 2 items each due to the surplus. Let's assign items to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Items 2 (88), 7 (89)
   - Assign: Items 2, 7

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Items 1 (94), 2 (93)
   - Item 2 already allocated to Agent 0
   - Assign: Item 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: Items 4 (85), 3 (77)
   - Assign: Item 4

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High valuations: Items 0 (75), 6 (79)
   - Assign: Item 6

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - High valuations: Item 7 (94)
   - Item 7 already allocated to Agent 0
   - Assign: No items initially, but needs at least 1 item

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - High valuations: Item 5 (91), 7 (94)
   - Item 7 already allocated to Agent 0
   - Assign: Item 5

Now, we have items 0 and 3 unallocated, and Agent 4 without an item.

- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 had a high valuation for item 3).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
