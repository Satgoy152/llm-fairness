Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  98   3  78  22  46   1  96
1  96  26   9  44  34  14   4  16
2  47  72  42  68  94  27  50  73
3  23  97  53  41  15  60  54  31
4  55  48   6  96  11   2  95  54
5  39  42  34  13  21  52  58  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate the items to the agents in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction (or total valuation) while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Their highest valuations are for items 1 (98) and 7 (96). We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Their highest valuation is for item 0 (96). We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Their highest valuation is for item 4 (94). We allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Their highest valuation is for item 1 (97), but since item 1 is already allocated, we look at their next highest valuation, which is item 5 (60). We allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Their highest valuation is for item 3 (96). We allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Their highest valuation is for item 6 (58). We allocate item 6 to Agent 5.

Now we have allocated 6 items. We still need to allocate items 2 and 7.

7. **Item 2**: It has relatively low valuations across agents, but the highest is by Agent 3 (53). Since Agent 3 has only one item, we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

8. **Item 7**: This item is valued highly by Agent 0 (96). Since Agent 0 has only one item, we allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

Now all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has received at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
