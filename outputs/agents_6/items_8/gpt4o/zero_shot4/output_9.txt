Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  48  79  25  34  28  29  56
1  69  43   3  57  95  56  27  44
2  23  36  24  97  57  52  21  19
3  15  71  28  48  31  85  91  30
4  94  25  60  27  57  93  20  20
5  54   8  10  37  68  70  69   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we should aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Given the table of valuations, one approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the respective agent.
2. Ensure that each agent with at least one item gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Following this process, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0 has the highest valuation by agent 4 with 94.
- Item 1 has the highest valuation by agent 3 with 71.
- Item 2 has the highest valuation by agent 0 with 79.
- Item 3 has the highest valuation by agent 2 with 97.
- Item 4 has the highest valuation by agent 1 with 95.
- Item 5 has the highest valuation by agent 3 with 85.
- Item 6 has the highest valuation by agent 3 with 91.
- Item 7 has the highest valuation by agent 0 with 56.

Using this strategy, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and all 8 items are allocated. Note that agent 5 receives no items under this allocation based on the highest valuation criteria.
