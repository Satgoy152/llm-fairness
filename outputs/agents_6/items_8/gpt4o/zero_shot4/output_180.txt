Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  89  71  55  85  59  77  49
1  78  34  77  16   8  41  98  10
2  15  20  66  66  28  46  20  90
3  11  67  92  61  43  36  61  37
4  27   0  42  61  28  71  93  78
5  66  59  23  40  76  10   8  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to ensure that each agent receives a close-to-equal distribution of their preferred items based on the valuations provided. We have 8 items and 6 agents, so some agents will receive more items than others. Let's distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:
- Assign the highest-valued item for each agent, then distribute the remaining items to balance the allocation while considering the next highest valuations.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items like 1 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize high-value items like 6 and 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize high-value items like 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Prioritize high-value items like 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Prioritize high-value items like 6.
6. **Agent 5**: Prioritize high-value items like 4.

### Resulting Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, considering their highest valuations.
