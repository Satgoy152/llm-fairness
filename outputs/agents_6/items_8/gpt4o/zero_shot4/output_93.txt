Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  51  60  61  48  57  99  67
1  83  54  80  69  11  72  40  42
2  42  40  60  35  59  13  67   8
3  35  30  43  91  74  39  13  24
4  99   2   1  99  58  16  83  34
5  10  61  98   9  59  53  46  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 54 80 69 11 72 40 42]
 [42 40 60 35 59 13 67  8]

 [10 61 98  9 59 53 46 82]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that every agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. A straightforward approach is to assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations for each item.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

1. For item 0, the highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 99.
2. For item 1, the highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 61.
3. For item 2, the highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 98.
4. For item 3, the highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 99.
5. For item 4, the highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 74.
6. For item 5, the highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 57.
7. For item 6, the highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 99.
8. For item 7, the highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 82.

Now, let's assign the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Items 0, 3
- Agent 5: Items 1, 2, 7

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 3],
    "5": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
