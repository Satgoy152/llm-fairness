Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  98   3  24  52  86  83  37
1  91  90  49  72  47  46  36   1
2  45  78  46  20   9  96  78  88
3  87  25  54   1  11  67  32  76
4  43  61  74  90  14  48  49  47
5  32  11   7  54   7  68  49  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the constraints, it might not be possible to perfectly optimize for every agent, but we can aim for a balanced distribution.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. First, sort each item by the highest value any agent places on it. 
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Following this approach, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most, so they get item 1.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most, so they get item 0.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most, so they get item 5.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most, so they get item 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most, so they get item 2.
- Agent 5 values item 6 the most, so they get item 6.
- The remaining items (4 and 7) can be allocated based on the next highest valuations to ensure fairness, so:
  - Agent 2 also values item 7 highly, so they get item 7.
  - Agent 4 also values item 4 highly, so they get item 4.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution by considering each agent's highest valuation for available items.
