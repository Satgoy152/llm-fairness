Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  15   4  94  71  54  36  77
1  69  46  72  45  35  64  97  20
2  70  52  83  15  53  78  16  54
3  83   8  47   9  35  13  11  23
4  54   5  35  78  66  97  27  99
5  77  79  75  41  76  29  18  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute them in such a way that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. We'll try to find a balance where each agent gets at least one item, and the allocations maximize the total value for each agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 3 (Value: 94)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 6 (Value: 97)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 5 (Value: 78)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 0 (Value: 83)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 7 (Value: 99)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 4 (Value: 76)
7. **Agent 0**: Item 1 (Value: 15, since Agent 0 had only one item initially, and this balances the count)
8. **Agent 2**: Item 2 (Value: 83, Agent 2 also had only one item initially)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item, and the distribution is based on maximizing the value for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.
