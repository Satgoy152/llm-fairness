Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  48  13  47  20  18  68  10
1  12   2  55  52  43  83  44  13
2  17  75  52  99  76  25   0  79
3  65  92  21  17  24   7  47  50
4   3  94  41  96  25  33  17  91
5  73  76  57  96   4  90  62  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can use a strategy which considers both the valuations and attempts to balance the distribution of items among agents. This type of problem is often tackled using techniques from fair division and can be complex if all fairness criteria are to be satisfied. Here, I will aim for a simple allocation that ensures each agent has at least some representation in the distribution while attempting to maximize the total valuation across all agents.

Based on the given valuations, a possible allocation could be:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first, if possible.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated and that the distribution is as fair as possible.

After examining the table, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [4, 7]
- Agent 5: [0, 2]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent and attempts to balance the distribution according to the agents' valuations. Each agent receives at least one item, except those who are intentionally not given due to maximizing the overall satisfaction based on valuations.
