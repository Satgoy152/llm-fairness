Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  96  22  78  15  78   2  35
1  26  81  80  39  52  14  50   5
2  17  10  75  50  11   4  25  49
3  28  32  39  68  77  21  76  66
4   4  30  68  27  95  73  11   8
5  47  45  89  22   9  75  91  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item if possible. We will try to distribute the items such that the overall perceived value is as balanced as possible among the agents.

Based on the given valuations, here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for any item, and start by allocating those items.
2. Continue assigning the remaining items to agents who have not yet received an item or have the highest valuation among the remaining items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value items are 1 and 3. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1: Highest value item is 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2: Highest value item is 2 (allocated), next is 3. Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3: Highest value item is 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4: Highest value item is 4 (allocated), next is 0. Allocate item 0 to agent 4.
- Agent 5: Highest value item is 6. Allocate item 6 to agent 5.

Now, allocate the remaining items:
- Item 5: Agent 5 has the next highest value for item 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 5.
- Item 7: Agent 3 has the next highest value for item 7. Allocate item 7 to agent 3.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6, 5]
}
```
