Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  82  15  16   0  42  92  41
1   3  19  36  71  14  52  17  14
2  97   5  21  73  25  49  81  75
3  58  13  99  39  72  65  30  70
4   3  30   7  15  47   8  19  76
5  86  63  49   7  19  36   7  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This is a simplified version of the "Maximum Weight Matching" problem in combinatorial optimization.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 2** has a very high valuation (97) for item 0, which is also the highest valuation for that item. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation (99) for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation (92) for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation (92) for item 7. Assign item 7 to Agent 5.
5. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation (71) for item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation (76) for item 7, but that item is already allocated. However, Agent 4 has a decent valuation (47) for item 4, which is unallocated. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
7. **Agent 5** has a high valuation (63) for item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 5.
8. **Agent 3** is left with item 5, which has a decent valuation (65). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and preferences are fairly considered based on the highest valuations for available items.
