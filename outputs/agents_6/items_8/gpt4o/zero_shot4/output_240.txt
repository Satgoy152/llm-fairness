Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  61  47  66  98   4  87  46
1   5  84  55  53  25  27  30  39
2  99  36  28  12  41  12  89  55
3  70  41  56  32  76  74  63  36
4  64   2  26  60   7  44  55  15
5  23  60  37  93  79  85  42  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 61 47 66 98  4 87 46]
 [ 5 84 55 53 25 27 30 39]
 [99 36 28 12 41 12 89 55]

 [23 60 37 93 79 85 42 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents such that the total valuation is maximized and each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a greedy approach. This involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's assign items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by agent 2 (99).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by agent 1 (84).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by agent 3 (56).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by agent 5 (93).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by agent 0 (98).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by agent 5 (85).
7. Item 6 is valued highest by agent 2 (89).
8. Item 7 is valued highest by agent 2 (55).

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 6, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated to the agents while maximizing the total value each item brings to an agent.
