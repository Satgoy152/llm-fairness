Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  14  77  29  24   5  25  16
1  13  13  89  54  23  94   9  86
2  19  12  43   0  41  42  41  92
3  53  29  72  54  76  58  13   0
4  99  53  74  34  71  45  13  55
5  90  84  12  87  52  51  19  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items based on the maximum value each agent assigns to them:

1. **Item 0:** The highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 99.
2. **Item 1:** The highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 84.
3. **Item 2:** The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 89.
4. **Item 3:** The highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 87.
5. **Item 4:** The highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 76.
6. **Item 5:** The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 94.
7. **Item 6:** The highest valuation is by agent 2 with a value of 41.
8. **Item 7:** The highest valuation is by agent 2 with a value of 92.

Allocating based on these values, we get:

- Agent 0: No items.
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5.
- Agent 2: Items 6, 7.
- Agent 3: Item 4.
- Agent 4: Item 0.
- Agent 5: Items 1, 3.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
