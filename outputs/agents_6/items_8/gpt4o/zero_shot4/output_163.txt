Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12   6  44  51  90  99  17  83
1  53  34  50  17  31  20  32  98
2  21   3  83  59   9  33  24   2
3  80  43  34  59   2  43  82  20
4  24  48   8  51   0  94  69  19
5  82   0   9  27  45  88  78  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 34 50 17 31 20 32 98]
 [21  3 83 59  9 33 24  2]

 [82  0  9 27 45 88 78 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most with a valuation of 99.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the most with a valuation of 98.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 83.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 80.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the most with a valuation of 94 (already taken), so next is item 1 with a valuation of 48.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 82 (already taken), so next is item 7 with a valuation of 88 (already taken), then item 5 with a valuation of 88 (already taken), and finally item 6 with a valuation of 78.

After considering the highest valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Items 3, 4, and 6

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item they highly value. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
