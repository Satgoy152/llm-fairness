Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  42  82  63  70  69  81   8
1  71  92  59  82  85  61  62  92
2  77  94  41   4  85  74  95  14
3  72  63   2  51  74  96  86  31
4  86   1  99   3  32  46  14  20
5  10  48  48  77  63  76  88  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or value each agent receives. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We should ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible while considering each agent's valuation of the items.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 2** values item 6 highly at 95, so let's allocate item 6 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 4** values item 2 highly at 99, so let's allocate item 2 to agent 4.
3. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly at 92, so let's allocate item 1 to agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly (but it's already taken), so let's allocate item 3 to agent 0 for 63.
5. **Agent 3** values item 5 highly at 96, so let's allocate item 5 to agent 3.
6. **Agent 5** values item 5 highly (but it's already taken), so let's allocate item 3 to agent 5 for 77 (note: agent 0 also wanted this but agent 5 values it more).
7. **Agent 0** values item 6 highly (but it's already taken), so let's allocate item 4 to agent 0 for 70.
8. **Agent 1** values item 7 highly at 92, so let's allocate item 7 to agent 1.

Now, let's make sure all items are allocated and present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

Note: This allocation aims to ensure that each agent gets an item they value highly, while distributing the remaining items fairly. Agent 5, unfortunately, does not receive any items under this strategy, as the items they value highly were claimed by others with higher valuations.
