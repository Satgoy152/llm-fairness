Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  22  39  82  90  82  99  28
1  38  19  13  22  35  60  33  61
2  33  39  97  15  54  76  70  21
3  44  23  44  29  38  25   3  11
4  33  10   2  73  45  13  64  83
5  98  52  74  40  13  16  95  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction by distributing the items based on the agents' valuations. Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (99).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest (97).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 5, as agent 5 values it the highest (98).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (90).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest (76).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (82).
7. Assign item 7 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the highest (83).
8. Assign item 1 to agent 5, as agent 5 values it the highest (52).

After allocation, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 4, 3]
- Agent 1: Items []
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 3: Items []
- Agent 4: Items [7]
- Agent 5: Items [0, 1]

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```
