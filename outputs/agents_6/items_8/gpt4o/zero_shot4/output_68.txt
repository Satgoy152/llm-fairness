Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  32   9  62  45  13  18   8
1  50  68  16  82  19  76  49   0
2  21  84  58  61  51  20   9  76
3  62  88  73  58  59  99  14  30
4  70  41  96  11  52  68  88  46
5  32  70  36  62  82  39  53  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the maximum value each agent places on the items.
2. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item by making necessary swaps if any agent has no items.

After evaluating the table, we can follow these steps:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (62).
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (68).
- Agent 2 values item 7 highly (76).
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly (99).
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly (96).
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly (82).

This assignment ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and we can distribute the remaining items based on the second-highest preferences or by balancing the allocation.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation that fulfills the criteria and ensures a fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4, 0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and exactly 8 items are distributed among them.
