Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75   5  85  76  21  88  53  54
1  38  34  95  88   4  46  91  68
2  45  57  88  65  21  91  26  84
3  62  52  88  55  23  71  25  66
4  78  71  48  79  75  17  68  89
5  28  63  90  97   2   0  13  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. For each item, assign it to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's evaluate and allocate:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the highest (78).
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the highest (71).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest (95).
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it the highest (97).
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the highest (75).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest (91).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the highest (91).
- Item 7: Agent 4 values it the highest (89).

Now we need to ensure all agents receive at least one item, if possible, and only allocate 8 items in total:

- Agent 0: No items are essential to Agent 0, so they can remain without items.
- Agent 1: Item 2 and Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: No essential items for Agent 3, so they can remain without items.
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1, 4, and 7
- Agent 5: Item 3

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 1, 4, 7],
    "5": [3]
}
```
