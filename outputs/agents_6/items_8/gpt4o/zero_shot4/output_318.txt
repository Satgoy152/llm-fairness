Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  91  27  77  48  72  68  65
1   1  40  94  97  27  30  26  89
2  93   3  61  90  92  98  11  86
3  20  36  99  77  80  22  27  65
4  90  81  88  46  18  50  98  39
5  80  92  34  25  53  64  24  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 40 94 97 27 30 26 89]
 [93  3 61 90 92 98 11 86]
 [20 36 99 77 80 22 27 65]
 [90 81 88 46 18 50 98 39]
 [80 92 34 25 53 64 24 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's preferences and aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible among the agents. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Here's a reasonable way to distribute the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can potentially receive by summing up the values of all items for each agent.
2. Distribute the items in a way that maximizes the value each agent receives relative to their preferences.

Based on the valuation table, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 5, 7
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Item 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while distributing the total value fairly.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```
