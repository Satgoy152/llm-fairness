Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  42  70  68  94  49  48  26
1  16  21  27  90  43   1  60  89
2  35  71  70  40   2  89  14  70
3  77  94  87   1  84  55  42  77
4  39  45  60  54  94  94  61  72
5  21  42  15  41  40  69  79  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [21 42 15 41 40 69 79 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 4 (value 94 for agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 (value 90 for agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items 1 and 5 (total value 71 + 89 = 160 for agent 2).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items 0 and 7 (total value 77 + 77 = 154 for agent 3).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items 2 and 6 (total value 60 + 61 = 121 for agent 4).
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate no items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all 8 items are allocated, and the allocations maximize the total valuations for the agents. 

The JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": []
}
```
