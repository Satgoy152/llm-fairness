Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  51   5  77  62  68  13  68
1   6  48  13   3  82  29  79  14
2  12  72  21  28  36  22  79   7
3  14  73  49  89  78  12  86  47
4  64  49   7  79  99  49  98   5
5  20  86  59  11  52  68  85  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the table, we can approach this as an optimization problem, attempting to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3, so allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4, so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3, already allocated, but item 6 is also highly valued, allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 4, already allocated, but item 5 is also highly valued, allocate item 5 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 1, already allocated, but item 2 is also valued, allocate item 2 to agent 5.
7. Allocate the remaining items (0 and 7) to agents who have less or no items yet, balancing the distribution.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [2, 7]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```
