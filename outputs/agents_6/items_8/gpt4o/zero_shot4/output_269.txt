Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  61  93  86  99  22  86  63
1  79  60  70  41  76  65  67  67
2  90  60  14  86   1  56  61  92
3  31   0  38  33  60  72  47   1
4  68  63  47  81  20  18  83  92
5  51  32  25  89  21  20  29  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[99 61 93 86 99 22 86 63]
 [79 60 70 41 76 65 67 67]
 [90 60 14 86  1 56 61 92]

 [68 63 47 81 20 18 83 92]
 [51 32 25 89 21 20 29 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, as much as possible. Here's a possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0 and 4. Assign items 0 and 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a relatively high value for item 2. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high values for items 3 and 7. Assign items 3 and 7 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high value for item 5. Assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a relatively high value for item 6. Assign item 6 to agent 4.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with at least one item, except for agent 5, who gets no items since there are only 8 items and 6 agents. The allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation received by the agents.
