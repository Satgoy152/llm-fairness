Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  84  56  76   9  97  53  51
1  18  20  99  28  94  24   1  32
2  50  69  70  40  23  73  30   4
3  10  47  69   1  79   3  83  59
4  27  43  29  50  81  27  40  69
5  42   2  64  19  11  94  96  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total satisfaction based on the agents' valuations. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We'll also ensure that exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (66).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (84).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (99).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (76).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (94).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (97).
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (96).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (51).

Since Agent 0 has been allocated too many items, we need to redistribute some of them to ensure fairness:

- Reassign Item 3 to Agent 4, who values it next highest at 50.
- Reassign Item 7 to Agent 3, who values it next highest at 59.

Now let's allocate the items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.
