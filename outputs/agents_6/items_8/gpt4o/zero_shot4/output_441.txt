Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  47  47  38  48  48  65  23
1  55  80  58  85  32  74  75  20
2   1  36  56  11  34  55  60  66
3  19  54  17  82  96  13   1   4
4  53  27  84  32  28  99  55  96
5  51  94  19  16  31   6  28  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly at 88.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly at 85.
- Agent 2 values item 7 highly at 66.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly at 96.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly at 99.
- Agent 5 values item 1 highly at 94.

Now, we have assigned one item to each agent based on their highest valuation. We have two items left (2 and 6).

To allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2: Agent 4 values it at 84, which is the highest valuation among unallocated items for any agent.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 75, which is the highest remaining valuation.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 2],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated while aiming to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their given valuations.
