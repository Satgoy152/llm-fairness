Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  83  73  60  87  72  29  57
1  31  75  75  56  20  80  78  32
2  84  34  97  67  81  51  63  62
3  64  10  92  61  43  49  66  69
4  83  35  58  38  42  75  90  90
5  11  13  87  57  31  77  18  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. First, list out each agent's highest-valued item(s) that hasn't already been allocated to another agent.
2. Allocate items to each agent by starting with their highest-valued item and then proceeding to their next highest-valued item if needed.
3. Ensure all items are allocated while trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction.

Let's start with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 4 (87).
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 5 (80).
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 2 (97).
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 2, but it's already allocated, so the next highest is item 7 (69).
- Agent 4: Highest value is for item 6 (90).
- Agent 5: Highest value is for item 7, but it's already allocated, so the next highest is item 2, but it's already allocated, so the next highest is item 5, but it's already allocated, so the next highest is item 3 (57).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items by checking the next highest preference:

- Item 0: Allocate to Agent 2 (84).
- Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 (83).

Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly based on the agents' preferences.
