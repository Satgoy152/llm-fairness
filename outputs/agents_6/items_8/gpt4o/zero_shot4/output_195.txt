Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  61  34  90  17   2  60  16
1  16  94  58  66  32  91  19  76
2   7  83  76  93  51   2  61  99
3  25  12  32  22  21  12  39  88
4  21  50  99  14  25   7  84  14
5  76  11  95  54  36  75  64   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuations:** For each item, determine which agent values it the most. This can help in initial allocation.

2. **Initial Assignment:** Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. 

3. **Balance Adjustments:** Check if the distribution is fair or if adjustments are needed to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most (76).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (94).
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most (99).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (93).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (51).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (91).
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most (84).
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (99).

**Initial Allocation:**

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 4, 7]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [2, 6]
- Agent 5: [0]

This initial allocation gives each item to the agent that values it the most. Let's check if adjustments are needed. 

Agent 1 and Agent 2 received more items initially, while Agent 0 and Agent 3 received none. To ensure a fair distribution, we might need to transfer some items from agents with higher allocations to those with none, or ensure that the total value is balanced.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and no agent is left without an item if possible, while still considering the initial value preferences.
