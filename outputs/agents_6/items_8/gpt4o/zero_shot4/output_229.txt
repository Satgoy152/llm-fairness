Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  11  51  20  41  93  60  79
1  58  51  23  46  51  29   2  97
2  29  45  33  35  52  96  71   4
3  85  71   3  84  73   7  78  61
4   4  31   5  15  19  23  67  14
5  63  54  33  81  68   1  11  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for a distribution where the total valuation each agent receives is approximately balanced. However, since there are 8 items and 6 agents, not every agent will receive items. We'll prioritize the allocation based on maximizing the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 very highly. We'll assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 7 the most. Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 highly, but it is already taken. The next best is item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 highly. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has relatively low valuations for most items. We'll assign item 4, as it doesn't conflict significantly.
6. **Agent 5** values item 3 highly. Assign item 3 to Agent 5.

Now, we have 2 items remaining (1 and 2), and we need to assign them to maximize the agents' total value.

7. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 5, as it provides a reasonable value.
8. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0, as it is among the available items with the next highest value for them.

This allocation ensures each item is distributed and attempts to maximize the total value assigned to each agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 1]
}
```
