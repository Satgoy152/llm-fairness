Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  60  17  47  14  16  77  33
1   4  35  78  49  24  14  21  26
2  73  29  16  35  82  18   6  47
3  78  55  23   5  84  13  72   9
4  99  87   6  71  47  60  46  91
5  79  32  53  98  31  30  79  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's preferences to maximize overall satisfaction. One common approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation per agent without overlap, ensuring that each item is allocated and no more than 8 items are assigned in total. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 99) and item 1 (value 87).
2. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 5) and item 4 (value 84).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 18).
4. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (value 77).
5. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 53) and item 7 (value 56).

Now, let's assign remaining items based on the next highest valuation to ensure all items are distributed:

- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 4
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 4
- Item 2: Assigned to Agent 5
- Item 3: Assigned to Agent 3
- Item 4: Assigned to Agent 3
- Item 5: Assigned to Agent 2
- Item 6: Assigned to Agent 0
- Item 7: Assigned to Agent 5

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```
