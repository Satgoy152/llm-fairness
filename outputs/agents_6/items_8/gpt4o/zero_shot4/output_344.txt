Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  11  23  90  42  67  41  32
1  26  60  26  97  15  19  38  12
2  16  33  71  18  48  27  61  55
3  68  12  27  16  20  98  97  62
4  40  85  87  80  77  76  48  61
5  69  67  25   2  58  24  93   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are distributed. We will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives for the items they are allocated. Below is one way to accomplish this:

1. Agent 0 has high valuation for item 3 (90).
2. Agent 1 has high valuation for item 3 (97), but agent 0 has a higher stake in it, so let's give agent 1 a different set.
3. Agent 2 has high valuation for item 2 (71).
4. Agent 3 has high valuation for items 5 (98) and 6 (97).
5. Agent 4 has high valuation for items 1 (85) and 2 (87).
6. Agent 5 has high valuation for item 0 (69) and 6 (93).

Let's distribute the items based on these considerations:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 4 and 7
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Items 5 and 6
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 0

In JSON format, the allocation looks like this:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation preferences, and all 8 items are distributed appropriately.
