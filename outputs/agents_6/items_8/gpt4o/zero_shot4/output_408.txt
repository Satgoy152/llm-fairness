Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  13  12  26  81  22  31  33
1  96  84  42  38  22  49  95  99
2  90   7  99  45  32  40  56   5
3  64  64  46  19  57  14  11   2
4  99  21  86  35  37  31  63  79
5  98  85  87  13   1  12  74  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that tries to maximize overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

From the table:

- Item 0 is most valued by agent 4 with a valuation of 99.
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 5 with a valuation of 85.
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 2 with a valuation of 99.
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 2 with a valuation of 45.
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 0 with a valuation of 81.
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 1 with a valuation of 49.
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 5 with a valuation of 74.
- Item 7 is most valued by agent 1 with a valuation of 99.

However, directly giving items to the highest valuing agent might leave some agents with no items. To ensure each agent receives at least one item, we will adjust the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Items 1, 6

Now, all agents have at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
