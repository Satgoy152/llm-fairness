Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  52  13  23  48  10  28  17
1  68  35  93  83  24  24  96  66
2  36   0  85  78  69  26  44  84
3  26  63  10  29  28  64  80   3
4  39  28  94  52   3  21   0  82
5  20  28  63  81  69  71  79  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

We can use a greedy approach where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 68 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 63 by Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 94 by Agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 83 by Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 69, shared by Agents 2 and 5. Allocate to Agent 2 (arbitrary choice).
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 71 by Agent 5.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 96 by Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: The highest value is 84 by Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most and all items are distributed.
