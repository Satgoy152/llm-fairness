Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  31  26  22  88   6  14  69
1  27  69  35  16   3  32  89  39
2  14  56  39  57  95  15  12  56
3  38  32   9  31   1  18  81  89
4  42  49  23   7  40  18  73  17
5  69   4  99  63  88  60  83  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent. We will choose the allocation based on maximizing each agent's total value for the items they receive. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most, but it's already taken. So, we select the next highest valued item that's not taken, which is item 3.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most, but it's already taken. So, we select the next highest valued item that's not taken, which is item 0.
- Agent 5 values item 2 the most.

Now, we've assigned 6 items. We'll assign the remaining 2 items based on the next highest valuations:

- Agent 1 also values item 1 highly, so they get item 1.
- Agent 5 also values item 5 highly, so they get item 5.

Thus, assignments are based on maximizing each agent's valuation of the items they receive:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
