Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  43  84  48  54  76  61  98
1  82  44  25   9  63  85  74  61
2  70  47  36  80  55  78  99  94
3  74  73  89  96  59   4  18  71
4  14  43  43  42  42  47  37  63
5   1  15  27  49  41  16  70  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuation table. One way to achieve this is by going through a series of steps to ensure that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's attempt to allocate items to agents in a way that reasonably maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an item.

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 7. We allocate item 7 to Agent 0 as it has the highest value for them.

2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** has moderate valuations, but item 4 has a unique high for this agent. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5** doesn't have high valuations, but item 5 is relatively higher for them compared to other agents. Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

This leaves us with items 1 and 2 unallocated:

- **Agent 0** has the second highest valuation for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to them.
- **Agent 3** has the second highest valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to them.

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
