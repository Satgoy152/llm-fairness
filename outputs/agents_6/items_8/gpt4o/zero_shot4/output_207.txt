Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  37  11  76  39  30  86  34
1  33  86  81  98   0  30  36  66
2  99  94  36  63  39   8  10  55
3  35  68  35  49  99  24  66  48
4  34  18  71  58  52  74  15  76
5  37  29  50   7  21   7  61  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute them based on maximizing the value each agent receives from their assigned items. We need to ensure that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If some agents have no items, reallocate to ensure everyone gets at least one.

Let's implement this strategy:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 99 by agent 2.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 94 by agent 2.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 81 by agent 1.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 98 by agent 1.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 99 by agent 3.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 74 by agent 4.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 86 by agent 0.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 76 by agent 4.

Now, let's check if every agent has at least one item. Agent 5 currently has no items. To ensure fairness, we will reallocate:

1. Reallocate item 5 from agent 4 to agent 5, since agent 4 also has item 7, which is valued 76 by them.

The final allocation should look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
