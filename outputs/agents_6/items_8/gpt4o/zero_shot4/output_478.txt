Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  17  35  70  49  43   3   0
1  99  45  78  89  20   3  74   3
2  85  21  69  73  40  62  60  85
3  42  20  13  46  44  46  30  29
4  58  57  26  84  35  29  91   0
5  88  27  39  99  96  54  99   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. One way to do this is to evaluate the highest value an agent has for an item and assign that item to the respective agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (89).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (89).
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (85).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (46).
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (91).
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest (99), but since it's already allocated, we give them item 4 (96).

Now, we have allocated 6 items. Let's allocate the remaining items:

7. For item 1, agent 4 values it at 57, which is the highest remaining unallocated value.
8. For item 2, agent 1 values it at 78, which is the highest remaining unallocated value.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
