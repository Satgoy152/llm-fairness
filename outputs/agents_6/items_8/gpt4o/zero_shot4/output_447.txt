Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  50  36  56  19   6  52  93
1  95  69  83  58  25   0  17  43
2  95  74  49  32  45  47  34  96
3  29  24  60  80   0  90  74  46
4  34  86  64  20  91  75  21   3
5  43  40  96  99  42  39  41  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Based on this strategy, here's a fair allocation:

- Item 0: Valuation highest for Agent 1
- Item 1: Valuation highest for Agent 4
- Item 2: Valuation highest for Agent 5
- Item 3: Valuation highest for Agent 5
- Item 4: Valuation highest for Agent 4
- Item 5: Valuation highest for Agent 3
- Item 6: Valuation highest for Agent 0
- Item 7: Valuation highest for Agent 2

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item. 

The allocation can be adjusted to:
- Agent 0: Gets item 6
- Agent 1: Gets item 0
- Agent 2: Gets item 7
- Agent 3: Gets item 5
- Agent 4: Gets items 1 and 4
- Agent 5: Gets items 2 and 3

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```
