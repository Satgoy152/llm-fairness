Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  21   4  19  10  82   3  17
1  70  42  69  89  56   9  88  46
2  30  14  47  96  80  45  71  76
3  73   4  22  24  45  45  18  47
4  15  11  75  56  19  90  25  31
5  91  80  34  26  38   7  59  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use a simple heuristic approach. We will aim to allocate items to agents based on maximizing the value each agent derives from the items they receive. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Begin by identifying the highest value each agent has for the available items.
2. Allocate items to the agents based on these highest valuations, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once and each agent receives at least one item where possible.
3. Continue the process until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this approach to the given data:

- Agent 0: The highest valuations are for item 5 (82).
- Agent 1: The highest valuations are for item 3 (89).
- Agent 2: The highest valuations are for item 3 (96) and item 4 (80).
- Agent 3: The highest valuations are for item 0 (73).
- Agent 4: The highest valuations are for item 5 (90).
- Agent 5: The highest valuations are for item 0 (91) and item 1 (80).

Allocating based on these high valuations:

1. Agent 5 gets item 0 (91).
2. Agent 4 gets item 5 (90).
3. Agent 2 gets item 3 (96).
4. Agent 1 gets item 6 (88) to maximize remaining high values.
5. Agent 0 gets item 1 (21) since item 5 is already taken, maximizing the next best option.
6. Agent 3 gets item 7 (47) as a fair allocation since item 0 is taken, maximizing the next best option.
7. Agent 1 gets item 4 (56) since it's unallocated and maximizes their value.
8. Agent 2 gets item 2 (47) as the remaining unallocated item maximizing their next best option.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```
