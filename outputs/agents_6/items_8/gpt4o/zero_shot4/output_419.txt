Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  55   0  41  78  67  68  55
1  15  71   8  19  84  58  31  54
2  25  88  24  75  89  76  67  51
3  86  12  22  33   9  46  28  52
4  75  60  29  24  12  27  24  27
5  59  23  24  84  22  87   4  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one common approach is to use a method that prioritizes the highest valuation an agent has for a given item. This approach ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it most, while trying to distribute items evenly among agents. 

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the provided valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 86.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 8.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 5 values it the most at 84.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 89.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it the most at 87.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most at 68.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most at 55.

Given these allocations, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, which means some adjustments may be necessary to balance the distribution among agents. Here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Items 3, 5

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and attempts to allocate items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
