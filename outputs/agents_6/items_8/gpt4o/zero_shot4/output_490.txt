Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  90  45  11  46  95  28  34
1  81  88   3  40  90  28  91  16
2  26  89  42  13  51  30  68  19
3   7  90  58  88  92  37  20  81
4  37  97  43  91  21  53  80  95
5   4  29  69  33  20  31  43  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 4 29 69 33 20 31 43 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items accordingly:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the highest.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 the highest.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can also receive item 0, since it's their second highest value item.
- Agent 3 can receive another item, item 6, which is their second highest after item 4.

This allocation would look like:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and considers each agent's preferences to an extent.
