Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  57  61  50  49  34  99  87
1  22  82  50  60  24  75  26  40
2   6  76  76  62  17  73  22  39
3  86  74  52  74  40  73  62  59
4  32  88  72  15  81  19  48  98
5  11   1  48   0  97  21  46  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and ensure that every agent receives an integer number of items while all items are allocated. We also need to ensure that the allocation is done in a way that tries to maximize fairness, potentially by considering each agent's highest valued items.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

- Agent 0 highly values items 6 and 7.
- Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 5.
- Agent 2 highly values items 1 and 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 0.
- Agent 4 highly values items 1 and 7.
- Agent 5 highly values item 4.

Let's allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each item is allocated only once:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 7 to Agent 4.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 5.
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
8. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

After ensuring each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.
