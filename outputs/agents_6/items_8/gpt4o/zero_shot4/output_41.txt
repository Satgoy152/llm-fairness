Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91   1  65   7  62   5  22  67
1  22  68  39  38  79  48  93  14
2  26   9  45  36   4  94  66  71
3  54  71  86   1  15  36   7  75
4   1  51  65  20  77  12  93  17
5  84   6   5  79   3  55  34  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Given the valuation table, a possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be made based on this strategy:

1. For item 0, the highest value is 91 by agent 0.
2. For item 1, the highest value is 71 by agent 3.
3. For item 2, the highest value is 86 by agent 3.
4. For item 3, the highest value is 79 by agent 5.
5. For item 4, the highest value is 79 by agent 1.
6. For item 5, the highest value is 94 by agent 2.
7. For item 6, the highest value is 93 by agent 1.
8. For item 7, the highest value is 78 by agent 5.

Based on this analysis, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item [0].
- Agent 1 gets items [4, 6].
- Agent 2 gets item [5].
- Agent 3 gets items [1, 2].
- Agent 4 gets no items [].
- Agent 5 gets items [3, 7].

Here is the allocation in the json format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 7]
}
```
