Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  88  80  78  65  30  52  82
1  71   5  74  26  98  49  99  59
2  94  51  68  42  19  88   9  70
3  39   7  75  97  51  88  22   3
4   0  64  94  82  52   5  37  59
5  21   3  29  38  39   7  82  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value, while also considering their individual valuations. This process involves trying to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their individual preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:
- We will allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly (88), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 highly (99), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 highly (94), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly (97), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 highly (94), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 highly (81), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 4 (98), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
8. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5 (88), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7]
}
```

Each agent gets a selection of items based on their highest valuations. This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
