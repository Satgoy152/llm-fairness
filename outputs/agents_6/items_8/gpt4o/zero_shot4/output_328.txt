Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  67   8  54  41  73  80  95
1  17  10  31  47  98  64  81  99
2  49  64  22  19  33  65  55  70
3  43  76  27  69  62  99  31  53
4  31  38   3  76  31   4  47  22
5  78  79  36  96  60  61  52  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [31 38  3 76 31  4 47 22]
 [78 79 36 96 60 61 52 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and no agent receives more than two items, as there are only 8 items and 6 agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 7 to agent 1, as it has the highest valuation of 99.
2. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as it has the highest valuation of 99.
3. Assign item 6 to agent 0, as it has the highest valuation of 80.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 5, as it has the highest valuation of 96.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 5, as it has the next highest valuation of 79.
6. Assign item 0 to agent 4, as agent 4 needs an item and 31 is a good value.
7. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as it has the highest valuation of 98.
8. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as it has a reasonable valuation of 22, given the circumstances.

Following this approach, the allocations in the requested JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
