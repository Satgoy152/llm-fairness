Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  87  79  73  49  34  86  25
1  53  94   1  99  26   3  15   8
2  50  47  91  94  70  66  82  72
3  57  66  26  65  88  32  51  94
4  34  50  84  93  37  99  63  18
5  52  12   6  59  66  81  66  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that every item is allocated and that the distribution is reasonably balanced.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 8).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by agent 1 (value 94).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by agent 2 (value 91).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by agent 1 (value 99).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 88).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by agent 4 (value 99).
7. Item 6 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 86).
8. Item 7 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 94).

Considering these allocations to try and balance the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Items 4, 7
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: No items

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all 8 items.
