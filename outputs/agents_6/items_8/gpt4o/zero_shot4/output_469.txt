Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  25  84  31  47  54  62   2
1  83  96  51  74  66  77  39  39
2  24  42  72  76  70  50  38  52
3  52  34  97   2  45  44  66  62
4  53  66  67  17  37  30  47  60
5  69  25  83  42  37   9  44  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. A possible approach is to use a method like the "greedy allocation" strategy, which involves iteratively assigning the highest-valued available item to the agent who values it most until all items are allocated. However, since there are 8 items and 6 agents, each agent will receive at least one item, and some agents will receive two items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. First, assign each agent the item they value the most.
2. Then, allocate the remaining items to the agents who value them the most among the remaining options.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (84) and item 6 (62 total value)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (96) and item 5 (77 total value)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (76)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (62)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (37)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (69)

Now, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
