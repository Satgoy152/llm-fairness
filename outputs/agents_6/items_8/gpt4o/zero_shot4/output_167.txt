Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  81   8  54  37  89  81  16
1   5  24  59   1  38  83   5  33
2  15  31  75   3  70  11  80  41
3   3  38  62  96  69  87  29  34
4   2  39  45  41  38  82  74  12
5  80  50  48  47  18  17  34  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to ensure that each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items.
2. Balance the distribution so that the total number of items allocated to each agent is reasonable.

Based on the valuations given, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to agent 4.
- Assign item 7 to agent 5.
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (since agent 0 values it highly and has room for another item).
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 (agent 2 values it relatively more than others).

Given this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. The allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has been given a chance to receive items they value relatively highly.
