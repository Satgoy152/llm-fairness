Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  99  98  98  46  13  83   1
1  81  67  40  62  85  25  36  49
2  42  34  86  50   9  55  36  84
3  56  81   0  72  57  44   6  78
4  32  90  18   0  93  30  87  90
5  89   1  69  76  86  87  84   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent given they receive an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Review the valuation matrix to understand which agents value which items the most.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible and all 8 items are distributed.

Here is a suggested allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 receives item 1 (99) and item 2 (98) as they have the highest values for these items.
- Agent 1 receives item 4 (85) because they have the highest value for this item.
- Agent 2 receives item 7 (84) as they have a high value for this item.
- Agent 3 receives item 3 (72) for which they have a relatively high valuation.
- Agent 4 receives item 5 (30) and item 6 (87) because of their high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 5 receives item 0 (89) as they have the highest value for this item.

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent, and all agents have the opportunity to receive items. Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [0]
}
```
