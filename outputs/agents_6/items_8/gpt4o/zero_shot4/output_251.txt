Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  44  68  95  31  97  83  46
1  17  40  24  21  81  48   6  77
2  11  31  95   3  27   0  10  45
3  92  86  74  73   5   2   8  31
4  45  95  27   8  63  31   5   0
5  26  25  95  73  76  78  76  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is assigned. Given the table of valuations, one approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the highest (92).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the highest (95).
3. **Item 2**: Agents 0 and 5 both value it highly (95), so we can allocate it to Agent 5 for balance.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the highest (95).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest (81).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the highest (97).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest (83).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 5 values it the highest (94).

Now, let's distribute the items fairly while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 5.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering agents' valuations and fairness.
