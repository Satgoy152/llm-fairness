Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  98  54  79  50  46  79  97
1  92  95  80  67  94  78   4  73
2  77  26  37  70  33  82  70  64
3   7  62  73  82  15   2  67  85
4  82  71  75  94  44  75  97  83
5  87  44  19  60  16  50  88  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to assign items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are assigned. 

Let's consider the valuations and try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring all agents receive at least one item.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest (92).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest (98).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest (80).
4. Item 3: Agent 4 values it the highest (94).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest (94).
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest (82).
7. Item 6: Agent 4 values it the highest (97).
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it the highest (83).

Now let's adjust to ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 3, with the next highest valuation for item 7 (85), will receive item 7 instead of Agent 4, ensuring they get at least one item.
- Agent 5, with the next highest valuation for item 0 (87), will receive item 0 instead of Agent 1, ensuring they get at least one item.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Items 3, 6
- Agent 5: Item 0

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [0]
}
```
