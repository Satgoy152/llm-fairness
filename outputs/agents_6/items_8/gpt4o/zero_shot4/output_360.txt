Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  78   4  62  31   2  67  39
1  20  68  25  60  82  69  32  71
2  67  25  63  49  46  99  64  23
3  18  76  19  74   7  74  11  10
4  90  55  65  76  82  88  65  42
5  22  98  54  28  58  97  37  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will also ensure that all 8 items are allocated. Here's one way to do this:

1. Calculate the value each agent has for each item.
2. Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 and 1 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 4 and 7 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 2 highly.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed to the agents according to their preferences.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
