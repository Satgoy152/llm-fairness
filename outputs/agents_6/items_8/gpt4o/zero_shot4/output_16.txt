Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  19  37  93  52  71  93  55
1  59  96  55  13   9  43  52  82
2  20  70  58  66  93  90  93   3
3  53  58  42  21   9  77  37  69
4  18  77  21  87  78   6  37  41
5  15   3  24  60  69  75  30  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent tries to get at least one item. 

Let's analyze the valuations and assign items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 7 has the highest value of 55. 
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 1 has the highest value of 96.
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 6 has the highest value of 93.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 5 has the highest value of 77.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Item 3 has the highest value of 87.

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Item 4 has the highest value of 69.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items fairly:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest after allocation of item 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest after allocation of item 7.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
