Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  71  78  40  20  91  82  65
1  72  53  14  27  51  67  93  34
2  45  59  29  19  45   9   4  56
3  46  73  45  11   4  21  67  99
4  23  94  10  80  78  32  62  60
5  68  77  89  80   0   8  19  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value and ensures each agent receives at least one item, where possible. Let's examine the table and allocate the items:

1. Assign items to agents where they have the highest valuation, ensuring that every agent gets at least one item, and only 8 items are allocated in total.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 91)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (value 93)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value 59)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (value 99)
- Agent 4: Item 3 (value 80)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (value 89)
- Agent 0: Item 4 (value 20)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 72)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total allocation is exactly 8 items.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```
