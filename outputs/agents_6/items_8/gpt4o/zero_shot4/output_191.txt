Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  54  63  35  38  49  69  46
1  22  77  23  21  71  17  61  39
2  91  12  68  34  31  22  25  80
3  32  44  44   1  63  36  22  95
4  30  24  93  74  66  69  76  46
5  68  83  13  86  26  75  20  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items with high values: 6 (69), 2 (63), and 1 (54).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items with high values: 1 (77), 4 (71), and 6 (61).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items with high values: 0 (91), 7 (80), and 2 (68).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items with high values: 7 (95), 4 (63), and 1 (44).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items with high values: 2 (93), 6 (76), and 5 (69).
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers items with high values: 3 (86), 1 (83), and 5 (75).

Taking into account these preferences, we aim to distribute the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Receives item 6.
- **Agent 1**: Receives item 1.
- **Agent 2**: Receives item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Receives item 7.
- **Agent 4**: Receives item 2.
- **Agent 5**: Receives items 3, 4, and 5.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, and all 8 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
