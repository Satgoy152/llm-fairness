Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  25  41  13  40  36  71  79
1  88  30  44  47  87  39  41  89
2  20  44   5  64  29   6  46  35
3  61  77   6  67  99  15  29  10
4  60  91  31  78  48  41  99  28
5  36  56  59  64  34  54  32  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that considers the valuations each agent has for each item, aiming for each agent to receive items that maximize their total valuation. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 seems to value item 6 the highest (71) and also has a high valuation for item 7 (79). 
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (89) and item 0 quite highly as well (88).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (64).
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (99).
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (91) and item 6 as well (99).
6. Agent 5 values item 7 the highest (75).

Based on these observations, let's try to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.
- Agent 5 gets item 7.

Let's check the remaining items (2, 5) for allocation:

- Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 (41).
- Agent 5 has a relatively high valuation for item 5 (54).

Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible, and all 8 items are allocated.
