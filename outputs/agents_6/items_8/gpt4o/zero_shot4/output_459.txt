Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  89  49   8   3  41  30  31
1  14  87  74  24  32  42   9  33
2  57  86  19  78  14  24  95  24
3  59  60   0  55  70  78  80  64
4  28  10  83  64  80  82  42   5
5  62  10  68  35  71  27  62  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable allocation according to their preferences. We'll try to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and total allocations do not exceed the number of items available.

Here's a reasonable allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
2. If there are leftover items, assign them based on the remaining highest valuations.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (89).
- Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (87), but since Agent 0 has already been assigned Item 1, we move to their next highest valuation, which is Item 2 (74).
- Agent 2 values Item 6 the highest (95).
- Agent 3 values Item 6 the highest (80), but since Agent 2 has already been assigned Item 6, we move to their next highest valuation, which is Item 5 (78).
- Agent 4 values Item 5 the highest (82), but since Agent 3 has already been assigned Item 5, we move to their next highest valuation, which is Item 4 (80).
- Agent 5 values Item 4 the highest (71), but since Agent 4 has already been assigned Item 4, we move to their next highest valuation, which is Item 0 (62).

Now, we have allocated 6 items, leaving Items 3 and 7 unallocated. We can assign these items based on the next highest valuations among those who have not yet received a second item:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 the second highest (75), but since Item 0 is already allocated, we consider their next highest, which is Item 2 (49), but it's already allocated. So, we move to Item 3 (8).
- Agent 3 values Item 7 the next highest (64).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with some agents receiving more items based on their relative rankings of the remaining unallocated items.
