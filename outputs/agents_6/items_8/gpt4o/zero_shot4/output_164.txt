Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  48  32  17  88  87  39  75
1   5  33  22  66  23   4  51  63
2  38  93  36  37  23  33   7  69
3   5  28  22  62  92  81  27  79
4  49  98  93  38  57  15  52  60
5  66  95  81  37  65  62  66  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 95 81 37 65 62 66 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations the agents have for each item. However, since fairness can be subjective, one approach is to try and maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.

Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and that all 8 items must be allocated, one possible fair allocation strategy is as follows:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item, and allocate the item to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Balance the allocations considering the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the table and allocate items:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 0 (95)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 4 (98)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 4 (93)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 1 (66)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 3 (92)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 0 (87)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 1 (51)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by agent 3 (79)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item. Since the allocations based on highest valuation might lead to some agents not getting any items, we may need to adjust:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Item 7 (to ensure agent 2 receives at least one item)
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Items 1, 2
- Agent 5: No items left for allocation (agent 5 receives no items)

After adjustments to ensure each agent gets at least one item, the allocations are balanced considering the valuations.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": []
}
```
