Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  61  70  20   5  12  34  77
1  97  24  65  85  78  63   8  16
2  78   4  63  65  15  55  68  11
3  18  36  70   7  65  23  52  92
4  10  10  32  65  28  24  35  43
5  40  58  25  86  23  48  20  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 8 items being allocated in total. Let's go through the process of assigning the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the valuations, Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (77). 
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most (97).
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 the most (68).
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 7 the highest, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 2 (70).
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (65).
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 3 the highest, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 1 (58).

After allocating one item to each agent, we have allocated 6 items. Now, we need to allocate the remaining 2 items fairly:

- Agent 0 could benefit from item 2, which they value at 70.
- Agent 1 could benefit from item 4, which they value at 78.

Based on these considerations, here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
