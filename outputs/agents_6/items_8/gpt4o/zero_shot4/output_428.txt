Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  36  98  75  30  98  41  52
1  33  51  31  31   5   9  51   6
2  85  59  82  47  78  94  99   4
3  31  40  80  16  46  38  88   6
4  63  42  84  99  61  47  64  47
5  27  46  49  75  30  10  91  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [27 46 49 75 30 10 91 40]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent receives a reasonable distribution of items based on their preferences. Here's one way to do it:

Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 5.
Agent 1 values item 1 the highest.
Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6 and 5.
Agent 3 values item 6 highly.
Agent 4 values item 3 the highest.
Agent 5 has a decent valuation for item 3.
Considering these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

Agent 0: Items 2, 5
Agent 1: Item 1
Agent 2: Item 6
Agent 3: Item 0
Agent 4: Item 3
Agent 5: Items 4, 7
The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 7]
}
```
