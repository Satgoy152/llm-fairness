Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  90  16  56  24  44  88  78
1  38   7  92  99   6  80  28  88
2  77  40   5  55  11  32  29  92
3   2  21   5  12  86  42  29   8
4  34  65  88  49  16   6  39  13
5  76  19  67  88  15  29  13  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we aim to maximize individual preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents may receive more items than others. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers item 1 (90) and item 6 (88).
2. **Agent 1:** Prefers item 3 (99) and item 2 (92).
3. **Agent 2:** Prefers item 7 (92).
4. **Agent 3:** Prefers item 4 (86).
5. **Agent 4:** Prefers item 2 (88) and item 1 (65).
6. **Agent 5:** Prefers item 0 (76).

Based on the preferences and ensuring all items are allocated, we can make the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and preferences are taken into account.
