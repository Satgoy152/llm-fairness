Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  31  48  78  86  25  78   3
1  94  96  78  79  43  51  73  24
2  35  78  44  89  10  27  64  13
3  75  77  70  40  24  75  91  25
4  68  86  31  95   4  78  71  35
5  31  40  97  24   5  22  26  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them to maximize satisfaction while adhering to the condition that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets a fair number of items.

Let's go through the items one by one:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with 94.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with 96.
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most with 97.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most with 95.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with 86.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most with 78.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most with 91.
- Item 7: Agent 5 values it the most with 84.

Now, we need to ensure a fair allocation by redistributing if necessary to balance out the number of items per agent:

- Agent 1 has 2 items: [0, 1]
- Agent 2 has no items: []
- Agent 3 has 1 item: [6]
- Agent 4 has 2 items: [3, 5]
- Agent 5 has 2 items: [2, 7]
- Agent 0 has 1 item: [4]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated and each agent gets a fair number of items based on their highest valuations.
