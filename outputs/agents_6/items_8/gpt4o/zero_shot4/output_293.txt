Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  13   9  15  56  95  25  71
1  94  31  88  83  62  81  96  98
2  62  70  24  27   6   8  26  44
3  69   5  12  28  70  43   8  46
4  52  72  97  16  32  31  19  50
5  78  55  68  54  65   0  76  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [78 55 68 54 65  0 76 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (94)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (72)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (97)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (83)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (56)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (95)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (98)

Now, let's allocate items to agents:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 6, 7
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 1, 2
- Agent 5: No items

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 3, 6, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": []
}
```
