Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  13  52  45  44  10  99  84
1   0  22  80  39  89  23  54  81
2  19  24  99   3  83  27  89  14
3  24   0  79  64  19  15  99  65
4   1  86  63  10  92  93  92  82
5  61  17  94  53  57  39  13  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while distributing all 8 items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by considering the highest valuation each agent has for any item.
2. Allocate items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction while ensuring no item is double-allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highly, so allocate item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values items 2 and 6 highly, but item 6 is already allocated, so allocate item 7 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values items 4, 5, and 6 highly, but items 4 and 6 are allocated, so allocate item 5 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 2 highly, but item 2 is allocated, so allocate item 0 to agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 3:

- Agent 0 can be allocated item 3, as it has a relatively high valuation for it.
- Agent 4 can be allocated item 1, as it has the next highest unallocated item valuation.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed.
