Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  56  56   5  30  32   4  18
1  79  40  13   8  34  24  91  19
2  21   0  59  65   4  35  58  81
3  44  63  84  34  28  72  73  90
4  30  94  81  48  84   1  93  46
5  45  93  65  55  77  31   2  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and try to balance the distribution so that each agent gets a reasonable share of total value based on their preferences. This can be a bit subjective without a specific fairness criterion (like maximizing minimum utility, envy-freeness, etc.), but we can try to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's go through each agent and allocate items based on their highest preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations on items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on item 6.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation on items 2 and 7.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation on items 3 and 7.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation on items 1, 4, 6.
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation on item 1.

Considering the above preferences and aiming for fairness, I will allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 1]
- **Agent 1**: [6]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [7]
- **Agent 4**: [4]
- **Agent 5**: [5, 3]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item based on their highest valuations and ensures that all items are allocated. Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 3]
}
```
