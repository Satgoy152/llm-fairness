Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  79   9  21   5  98  54  44
1  97  34  57   8  45  32  93  21
2   2  90  17  86   9  26  31  28
3   7  99  40  72  37  72  41  47
4  85  94  18  24  22   7  93  60
5  56   0   3  71  26  11   6  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are allocated. We'll ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated.

Let's consider the allocations step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 5 highly (98). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 0 highly (97). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 1 highly (90). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 3 highly (72). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: They value item 4 highly (22). Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: They value item 7 highly (86). Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 5.

At this point, each agent has been allocated one item, and we have allocated 6 items in total. We still have items 2 and 6 available.

7. **Additional Allocation**:
   - Agent 3 values item 2 (40) quite high compared to others, so let's allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 0 values item 6 (54) significantly, so let's allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

Now, all 8 items have been allocated, and each agent has received at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7]
}
```
