Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  38  66  35  69  50  33   6
1  81  59  30  99  48  84  12  92
2  81  60   1  24  52  22  24  44
3  49  70  47   7  19  41  51  39
4   1  12  68  26  36   8  74  83
5  90  30  47  81  46  74  62  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 38 66 35 69 50 33  6]
 [81 59 30 99 48 84 12 92]
 [81 60  1 24 52 22 24 44]
 [49 70 47  7 19 41 51 39]
 [ 1 12 68 26 36  8 74 83]
 [90 30 47 81 46 74 62 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuations. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Chooses item 0 with a value of 73.
2. **Agent 1**: Chooses item 3 with a value of 99.
3. **Agent 2**: Chooses item 1 with a value of 60.
4. **Agent 3**: Chooses item 5 with a value of 41.
5. **Agent 4**: Chooses item 7 with a value of 83.
6. **Agent 5**: Chooses item 4 with a value of 46.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

7. **Agent 0**: Chooses item 2 with a value of 66.
8. **Agent 5**: Chooses item 6 with a value of 62.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total valuation is maximized. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```
