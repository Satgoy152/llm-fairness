Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62   2  47  85  92  82   4  95
1  24  28  59  77  97  25  15  37
2  36  93  18  49  64  65  53  19
3  92  91  75  55  21  18   5  74
4  68  86  22  35  69  94  80  98
5  22  30  61  55  73  42   1  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes total satisfaction, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and that no agent gets more than necessary. We can use a greedy approach to achieve this.

Let's analyze the valuations of each agent for each item and allocate the items based on the highest valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 highly (95), so let's allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (97), so let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly (93), so let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 highly (92), so let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 highly (98), but since item 7 is already allocated, we allocate item 5 (94) to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 highly (61), so let's allocate item 2 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

7. Agent 0 also values item 4 highly (92), but since item 4 is already allocated, let's allocate item 3 (85) to Agent 0.
8. Agent 4 values item 6 highly (80), so let's allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, all 8 items have been allocated. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [2]
}
```
