Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  54  44   1  56  60  38  53
1  34  62   2  66  99  36  38  51
2  83  85  54  59  23  88  10  19
3  37  25  56  63  89  37  77  53
4  54  99  99  29  89   7  42  41
5  77  69  74  96  78   6  74  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations. We will ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for item 5.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 4.
5. Agent 4 highly values items 1 and 2.
6. Agent 5 has high valuations for items 3 and 0.

Considering these preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item while all items are allocated, we can structure the allocation as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives at least one item.
- All items are allocated.
- The allocations respect the preferences of the agents as much as possible given the constraints.
