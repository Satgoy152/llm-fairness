Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  32  93  40  59  31   6  44
1  23  90   5  40   2  89  22  52
2  57  80  20  82  38  38   2   0
3  98  58  51  21  21  11  60  64
4   3   4  98  45  75   7  17  75
5  82  25  50  73  12  72  71  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach ensures that each item goes to the agent who derives the highest utility from it. Here's how we can proceed:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign that item to the agent.
3. Ensure every item is allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's assign the items to the agents based on the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most with 98.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with 90.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most with 98.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most with 82.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most with 75.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most with 89.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most with 71.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most with 64.

Now, we ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: No items.
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5.
- Agent 2: Item 3.
- Agent 3: Items 0, 7.
- Agent 4: Items 2, 4.
- Agent 5: Item 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
