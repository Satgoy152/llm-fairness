Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  37  63  95  61  35  89  52
1  92   1  97  56  53   2  56  22
2  77  96  61  15  80   7  87   8
3  20  50  48  74  58  14  16  31
4  69  61  34  81  44  17  35  52
5  84  44  27  68   5  77   6  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items. This approach is a simplified version of the maximum valuation method:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure each agent ends up with an integer number of items by redistributing if necessary.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on the highest valuations:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is 92 by Agent 1.
- Item 1: Highest valuation is 96 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest valuation is 97 by Agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest valuation is 95 by Agent 0.
- Item 4: Highest valuation is 80 by Agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest valuation is 77 by Agent 5.
- Item 6: Highest valuation is 89 by Agent 0.
- Item 7: Highest valuation is 52, tied between Agent 0 and Agent 4. We will assign it to Agent 0 since they have fewer items so far.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Note that Agents 3 and 4 end up with no items in this allocation.
