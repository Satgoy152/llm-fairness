Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  11  82  56  58  62  45  49
1  20  18  51  40  94  31  71  77
2   2  14  40  56  91  52  79   6
3  35  58  85  53  14  83  13  89
4  79  55  98  28  91  62  84   9
5  75   1  36  36  42  15   2  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Since there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share of total valuation.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - High value in item 2 (82) and item 0 (65)
- Agent 1:
  - High value in item 4 (94) and item 7 (77)
- Agent 2:
  - High value in item 6 (79)
- Agent 3:
  - High value in item 5 (83)
- Agent 4:
  - High value in item 1 (55)
- Agent 5:
  - High value in item 3 (36)

The allocation can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and every agent has the opportunity to gain value from the items they receive.
