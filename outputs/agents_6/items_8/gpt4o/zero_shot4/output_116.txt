Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  15  20  22  18  89  73  86
1  39  27   5   2  37  56  12  46
2  73  23  26  73  42  48  14  81
3  88  74  57  69  66  91   9  18
4  65  89  87  27  24  16  65  78
5  59   9   9  73  56  14  36  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple strategy that aims to maximize total satisfaction. One method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach ensures that each item goes to the agent who will appreciate it the most, thus maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Look at each item and determine which agent has the highest valuation for it.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Following this method, let's allocate each item:

- Item 0: Highest value is 88 (Agent 3)
- Item 1: Highest value is 89 (Agent 4)
- Item 2: Highest value is 87 (Agent 4)
- Item 3: Highest value is 73 (Agent 2)
- Item 4: Highest value is 66 (Agent 3)
- Item 5: Highest value is 91 (Agent 3)
- Item 6: Highest value is 73 (Agent 0)
- Item 7: Highest value is 86 (Agent 0)

Let's allocate the items according to these highest valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4, 5],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most, while the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
