Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  58  15  87   5  16  17  13
1   6  82   2  10  59  64  46   8
2  36  15  30  92   0   9  10  28
3  63  99  27  35  90  54  53  55
4  91  87  14  86  38  38  71  62
5  43  72  92  52  87  61   1  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is 87 for item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is 82 for item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is 92 for item 3, but it has already been allocated, so the next highest is 36 for item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is 99 for item 1, but it has already been allocated, so the next highest is 90 for item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is 91 for item 0, but it has already been allocated, so the next highest is 87 for item 1, then 86 for item 3, but both are taken, so 71 for item 6.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is 92 for item 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items, considering fairness.

- **Agent 0**: Already allocated item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Already allocated item 1.
- **Agent 2**: Already allocated item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Already allocated item 4.
- **Agent 4**: Allocated item 6.
- **Agent 5**: Allocated item 2.

Remaining items are 5 and 7. Let's allocate these:

- **Agent 0**: Can also take item 5 (value 16 for agent 0).
- **Agent 4**: Can also take item 7 (value 62 for agent 4).

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [2]
}
```

All 8 items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item.
