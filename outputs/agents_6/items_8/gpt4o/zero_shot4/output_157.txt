Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  56  68  69  14  75  84  18
1  43  82  97  18  53  26  98  63
2  40  27  91  67  12  28   2  96
3  28  35   2  78  73  54   8  79
4  81   1  65  33  81  97  65   3
5  27  35  10  47  15  13  62  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and the total number of items allocated is eight.

Let's start by allocating items with the highest value preferences for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 6 (value 84).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 6 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 7 (value 96).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 3 (value 78).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 5 (value 97).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 6 (value 62).

Since item 6 is highly valued by three agents, we need to prioritize it. Let's allocate it to Agent 1, who values it the most.

Now, let's re-evaluate the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 5 (value 75).
- **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 2 (value 91).
- **Agent 3**: Next highest is item 7 (value 79).
- **Agent 4**: Highest value item 5 was taken, next is item 0 (value 81).
- **Agent 5**: Highest value item 6 was taken, next is item 3 (value 47).

Let's allocate:
- Agent 0: item 5
- Agent 1: item 6
- Agent 2: item 2
- Agent 3: item 7
- Agent 4: item 0
- Agent 5: item 3

Now, we have allocated six items and need to allocate two more items. Let's distribute the remaining items 1 and 4 based on the next highest valuations for the agents:

- **Remaining Item 1**:
  - Agent 0: Value 56
  - Agent 1: Value 82
  - Agent 2: Value 27
  - Agent 3: Value 35
  - Agent 4: Value 1
  - Agent 5: Value 35

  Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

- **Remaining Item 4**:
  - Agent 0: Value 14
  - Agent 1: Value 53
  - Agent 2: Value 12
  - Agent 3: Value 73
  - Agent 4: Value 81
  - Agent 5: Value 15

  Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
