Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  40  26   9  92  60   0  33
1  14  75  48  25  72   0  23  56
2  74  38  35  17  32  51  28  29
3  60  50  47   9  61  38  47  10
4  77  95  38  76  20  92  80  34
5  64  49  75  87  19  87  10  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and use this to help guide initial allocations.
2. Assign items starting with the highest individual valuations to ensure fairness and maximize value.
3. Adjust allocations as necessary to ensure each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Based on the provided valuations, here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5] 
- Agent 1: Items [1]
- Agent 2: Items [2]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 5: Items [6]

This allocation ensures each agent gets an item, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
```
