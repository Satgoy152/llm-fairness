Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  24  39  56  47  67  40  72
1  10  87   2  56  23  53  95  76
2  39  82  78   8  91  89  95  30
3  27  61   6  29  69  52  32  92
4  68  59  88  59  13  52  27  75
5  86  87  87  98  26  78  93  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents while maximizing the total valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach, such as the "greedy" method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation would work based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 86 by agent 5.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 87 by agents 1 and 5. We can assign it to agent 5 since they already have item 0, assuming a fair distribution.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 88 by agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 98 by agent 5.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 91 by agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 89 by agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 95 by agents 1 and 2. We can assign it to agent 1 for fair distribution.
8. **Item 7**: The highest value is 94 by agent 5.

Now, let's distribute the items based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [4, 5]
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [0, 1, 3, 7]

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 1, 3, 7]
}
```
