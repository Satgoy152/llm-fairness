Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  90   4  82  50  69  70  69
1  24  23  16  31  64  91  53  29
2  41  84  62  43  43  93  90  62
3  86  59  38  22  20  36  52  88
4  63  59   2  18  95  10  66  77
5  48  21  49  60   1  38  25  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and a total of exactly 8 items are allocated.

Here is a suggested allocation based on maximizing the individual valuations for each item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 1 (valuation 90).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 5 (valuation 91).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 5 too, but since it's already taken, we'll allocate another high-value item such as item 6 (valuation 90).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 0 (valuation 86).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 4 (valuation 95).
6. Agent 5 highly values item 7 (valuation 97).

With these allocations, we have distributed 6 items, meaning we still need to allocate 2 more items.

7. Agent 2 can also be given item 2 (valuation 62), which is their next highest.
8. Agent 3 can be given item 7 (valuation 88), which is their next highest after the already allocated items.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated, with a focus on maximizing the satisfaction of each agent based on their individual valuations.
