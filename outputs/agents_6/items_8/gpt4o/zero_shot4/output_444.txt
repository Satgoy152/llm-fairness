Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  65  16  63   8  63  57  32
1  52  29  33  90  64  23   3  19
2  95  25  66  75  43  46  25   8
3  28  63  91  50   3  71  40   3
4  13  14  40  63  82  59  65  80
5  99  38  98  55  72   2  83  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items. Here's one way to allocate the items based on their valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3, so assign those to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most, but since item 3 is already allocated, allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2, and it's available, so assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly, but it's already allocated, so allocate item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4, so assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 can be assigned items 6 and 7, as they have high valuations for these items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6, 7]
}
```

This ensures all 8 items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
