Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  32  86  98  36  14  24  18
1  40  12  55  49  46  71  52  75
2  42  38  79  86  18  32  74  90
3  11  97  92  60  87  92  37  93
4  11  73  93  78  26  97  48  63
5  97  31  57  83  53  86  26   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider both the valuations of each agent for the items and the need to distribute all items such that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We need to balance the distribution so each agent is satisfied as much as possible with their allocation.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 3 and 2 highly, so we allocate those items to them.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 highly, so we allocate item 5 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 7 highly, so we allocate item 7 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to them.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to them.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 0 highly, so we allocate item 0 to them.

Now, let's check which items are unallocated and distribute them to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We have allocated 6 out of 8 items, so we need to allocate 2 more.

7. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Item 4 and item 3 are unallocated. Since agent 3 has only one item, we can assign item 4 to agent 3.

Revising based on the above, let's try:

- **Agent 0**: [2]
- **Agent 1**: [5]
- **Agent 2**: [7]
- **Agent 3**: [1, 3]
- **Agent 4**: [6]
- **Agent 5**: [0, 4]

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent gets a reasonably fair share based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```
