Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73   6  47  28  42  39  24  28
1  50   1  30  25   1  99  51   4
2  37  38  70  39  34  98  70  93
3  58  81  61  89  60  53  80  64
4  76  81  82  92  40  82  93  15
5  20  86  64  91  54  46  65  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction or total value for each agent, considering the constraints that all items must be allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items. We can achieve this by strategically distributing the items based on the valuations given in the table.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 7.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 6.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 1.

Next, we allocate the remaining items 2 and 4 to agents with relatively high valuations for these items, ensuring a fair distribution. Let's assign:

- Item 2 to Agent 4, who has a relatively high valuation for it.
- Item 4 to Agent 3, who also has a reasonable valuation for it.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [6, 2],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing each agent's total valuation, given the constraints.
