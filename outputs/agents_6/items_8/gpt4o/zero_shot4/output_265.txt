Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25   0  83  95  90  60  47  14
1  82  77  90  56  75  98  26  34
2  26  80  52  79  89  47  61  35
3  71  51  44  40  51  54  13  46
4   3  47  36  94  91  35  44  95
5  46  46  89  20  21  32  14  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring every agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a potential allocation approach where each agent receives items that maximize their individual value:

1. Assign items based on each agent's highest value that hasn't been allocated yet.

Let's assign the items to the agents:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3 (95).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 5 (98).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 4 (89).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 0 (71).
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 7 (95).
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 2 (89).

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. Let's assign the remaining items based on the next highest values available:

- Agent 0 can take item 6 (47).
- Agent 1 can take item 1 (77).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their total value from the available choices while distributing all 8 items.
