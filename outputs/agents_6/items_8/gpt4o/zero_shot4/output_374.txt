Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  67  33  17  14  72  82  32
1  28  48  33  54  40  35  83  83
2  11  68  25  35  66  21  99  23
3  26  31  44  94  53  78   7  13
4  10  53  29  79  47  63  47  23
5  88  40  85  54  51  89  85  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we'll aim to distribute the items based on each agent's valuations in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. One common approach is to use the "envy-free" or "max-min fairness" principle, though achieving perfect fairness can be challenging with such a small number of items relative to agents.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Begin by identifying the highest-valued item for each agent and try to allocate it to them if it doesn't cause significant imbalance.
2. Consider the overall distribution of items to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 6 (82) and item 0 (73). Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 6 (83) and item 7 (83). We have already allocated item 6 to Agent 0, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 6 (99). Since item 6 is already allocated, we look at the next highest, item 1 (68). Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 (94). Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 does not have a standout high value, but item 4 (47) seems reasonable. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 highly values item 5 (89). Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Now we have allocated 6 items, and we have 2 remaining: items 0 and 2.

- Item 0 (valued 73) can go to Agent 0, who values it highly.
- Item 2 (valued 85) can go to Agent 5, who values it second highest after item 5.

Now all 8 items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 2]
}
```
