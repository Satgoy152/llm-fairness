Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  79  68   5  91  82  23  59
1  11  90  35  55   8  83  55  40
2  63  82  80  23  21  51  49  49
3  40   8  92  42  14  45  14  77
4  65  85  16  14  11  76  18   7
5  55  43  71  43  24  86  43  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. One approach is to consider each agent's preferences and distribute the items to maximize total satisfaction, while ensuring a fair distribution. Below is one possible allocation that satisfies these criteria:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 highly, so we can assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1, so we can assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 0, so we can assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3, so we can assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 can be given item 5, which they value reasonably well.
6. Agent 5 can be given item 6, which is valued moderately across the board.
7. Agent 0 can take item 0, which they value highly.
8. Agent 3 can also take item 7, which they value well.

The allocation based on the above reasoning would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item where possible, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
