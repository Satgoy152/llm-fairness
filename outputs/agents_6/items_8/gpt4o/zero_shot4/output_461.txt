Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  50  55  62  57  58  92  74
1  55  31  25  90  64  66  54  48
2  38  68  45   2  36  69  32  49
3  92  84  94  71  38  90  47  12
4  36   4  32  53  16  62  11  67
5  75  49  19  39  54  49  47   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can approach this as an optimization problem aiming to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring that all items are distributed.

One potential way to do this is to utilize a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 92.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 84.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 94.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 90.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 64.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 69.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 92.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 74.

Now, let's see if each agent gets at least one item and adjust accordingly if necessary:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items

Currently, agents 4 and 5 have no items. We can adjust the allocation to ensure every agent receives at least one item by swapping a few items:

- Swap item 4 from agent 1 to agent 4.
- Swap item 5 from agent 2 to agent 5.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 5

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1, 2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
