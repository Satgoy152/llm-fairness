Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29   3  74   8  29  93  59  57
1  79  27  55  37  83  20  75  98
2  47  18  77  76  51  93  19  66
3  77  24   7  37  28  97  56  19
4  73  14  32   7  19  66  38  79
5  83  33  73  22  69  20  47   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share according to their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Calculate each agent's highest valuation items.
2. Allocate items based on who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 receives item 5 (highest valuation: 93).
- Agent 1 receives item 7 (highest valuation: 98).
- Agent 2 receives item 2 (highest valuation: 77).
- Agent 3 receives item 3 (highest valuation: 37).
- Agent 4 receives item 6 (highest valuation: 38).
- Agent 5 receives item 0 (highest valuation: 83).
- The remaining items 1 and 4 can be given to agents with lower total valuations to balance the allocation:
  - Agent 4 receives item 4 (valuation: 19).
  - Agent 0 receives item 1 (valuation: 3).

Based on the above distribution, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
