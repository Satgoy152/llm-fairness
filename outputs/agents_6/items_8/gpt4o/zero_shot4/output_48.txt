Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  96  87  54  49  58   0  38
1  53   3   4  61  37  32  91  46
2   1  20  58  27  96  57   5  77
3  16  62   3  45  77  71  37  44
4  38   0  89  41  81   3  86  77
5  84  72  19  39  22  57  59  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall utility while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. One of the strategies is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each item's value to the agents:

1. Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most with 84.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most with 96.
3. Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most with 89.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most with 61.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with 96.
6. Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most with 71.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most with 91.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most with 77.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item by making minor adjustments:

- Agent 5 has item 0.
- Agent 0 has item 1.
- Agent 4 has item 2.
- Agent 1 initially has items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2 initially has items 4 and 7.
- Agent 3 has item 5.

Since agent 3 only has one item, this is a reasonable allocation. However, to ensure fairness and that no agent gets more than two items while covering all items, an additional check can be done.

Let's review the allocation again to ensure each agent gets an item:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [3, 6]
- Agent 2: [4, 7]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [0]

Now presenting the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```
