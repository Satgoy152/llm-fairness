Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  13  20  58  18  13  41  96
1  11   9  67  33  72  83  22  95
2  41  77  31  17  62  18  20  18
3  32  55  39  47  17   8  76  55
4   8  93  48  19  74   0  89  79
5  65  24   7   5   5  62  28  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 8 93 48 19 74  0 89 79]
 [65 24  7  5  5 62 28 64]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. An equitable allocation should consider the agents' valuations of each item. One approach is to use a method like the "maximum marginal valuations" or "highest bidder" approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 5 values it highest at 65.
2. Item 1: Agent 4 values it highest at 93.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 67.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest at 58.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it highest at 72.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it highest at 83.
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it highest at 76.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it highest at 96.

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and we have allocated all 8 items.

Now, presenting this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```
