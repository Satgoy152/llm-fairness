Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  13   8  92  11  17  86  55
1  11  95  75  43  36  62  66  91
2  47  17  36  39  65  13  92  67
3  60  50  46  60  62  70  70   2
4  39  64  54  11  78  36  50  86
5  89   0  81   0  38  55  93  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, meaning that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value another agent's allocation. Given the constraint of integer allocations, we will proceed with a methodical approach to ensure a fair distribution. 

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Total Value Calculation:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.

2. **Item Bidding:**
   - Allow each agent to "bid" for items based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy.

3. **Iterative Allocation:**
   - Allocate items one by one based on the highest bid from an agent for an unallocated item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

4. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Adjust allocations to balance the total value received by each agent, considering the limits of integer allocations.

### Allocation:

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Has high value for item 3 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Has high value for item 1 and 7.
- **Agent 2**: Prefers item 6 and 7.
- **Agent 3**: Values items 5 and 0.
- **Agent 4**: Values items 4 and 7.
- **Agent 5**: Prefers items 5 and 7.

Given these preferences, let's distribute the items:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 3).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 1).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (second highest value for item 6).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (second highest value for item 5).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (highest value for item 4).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 5 (highest value for item 7).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 5 (second highest value for item 0).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (second highest value for item 2).

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives while respecting their preferences.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations, with the goal of minimizing envy.
