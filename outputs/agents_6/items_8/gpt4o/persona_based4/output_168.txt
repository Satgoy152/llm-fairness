Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82   8   9  16  90  41  54  29
1  48  45   7  55  67  50  84  81
2  12  12  67  62  58  53  18   2
3  88   8  76  63  14   1  36  96
4  55   3  88  57  86  96  77  35
5   4  56  53  54  60  83  28  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we'll use a common method such as the "round-robin" or "maximal marginal improvement" approach. Here, we'll try the maximal valuation method, where each agent gets the item they value the most among the remaining items in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.

Let’s go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [82, 8, 9, 16, 90, 41, 54, 29]
   - Highest valued item: 4 (90)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [48, 45, 7, 55, 67, 50, 84, 81]
   - Highest valued item: 6 (84)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [12, 12, 67, 62, 58, 53, 18, 2]
   - Highest valued item: 2 (67)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [88, 8, 76, 63, 14, 1, 36, 96]
   - Highest valued item: 7 (96)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values: [55, 3, 88, 57, 86, 96, 77, 35]
   - Highest valued item: 5 (96)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Values: [4, 56, 53, 54, 60, 83, 28, 54]
   - Highest valued item: 5 (83)

After the first round, items 4, 6, 2, 7, and 5 are allocated. We have 3 more items to allocate: 0, 1, 3.

Continuing with the unallocated items:

7. **Agent 0** (next highest after 4):
   - Highest valued item: 0 (82)

8. **Agent 1** (next highest after 6):
   - Highest valued item: 3 (55)

9. **Agent 2** (next highest after 2):
   - Highest valued item: 1 (12)

Now, all items are allocated. Let’s summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed based on the agents' preferences without exceeding the total number of available items. Each agent gets items they value highly, aiming for an envy-free solution.
