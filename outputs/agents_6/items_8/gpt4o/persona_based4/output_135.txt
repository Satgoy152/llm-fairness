Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  87  35  27  43  30  99  72
1  60  29  19  62  43  39  44  35
2   3  61  35  92  40  66  81  42
3   9  71  53  36  10  86  87  11
4  46  36  33  62  31  71  49  71
5  23  76  29  64  79  42  12  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of any other agent. Given the valuations, we aim to assign items such that the perceived value for each agent is balanced, minimizing envy.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences**: Look at the highest value items for each agent. This will help in understanding which items are crucial for each agent.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by allocating the highest value items to each agent, ensuring no conflicts. If two or more agents have a high valuation for the same item, consider their next highest preferences or distribute based on who values it more relative to their other options.

3. **Balancing the Allocations**: After initial allocation, check if any agent has significantly less value than others. Adjust by reallocating less valued items to balance the overall perceived values.

4. **Final Adjustments**: Ensure that each agent receives a fair share of items, and no agent has a strong incentive to swap allocations due to envy.

Now, based on the valuations provided, here is one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 1 and 6.
- Agent 1 has a high value for item 0.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 3 and 6.
- Agent 3 has a high value for item 6.
- Agent 4 has no particularly high value, but needs a fair allocation.
- Agent 5 has a high value for item 7.

Considering these points, a reasonable allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [6] (high value)
- Agent 1: [0] (high value)
- Agent 2: [3] (high value)
- Agent 3: [5] (a decent value)
- Agent 4: [4, 1] (two moderate values)
- Agent 5: [7, 2] (high value for 7, moderate for 2)

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived values while ensuring that each agent ends up with a reasonable share of the items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 1],
    "5": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation meets the requirement of assigning all 8 items and attempts to minimize envy among agents based on their valuations.
