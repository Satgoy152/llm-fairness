Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  23  87  58   7  72  50  86
1  35  15  89  95  42  48  75  25
2   9  81  14  20  43  34   1  64
3  59  58  18  58  96  15   1  18
4  37  12  28   9  28  33  32  51
5  21  87  61  33  47  62  11  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent is satisfied with their allocation. We will use the "round-robin" method, which is a simple yet effective way to allocate items in a way that can lead to envy-freeness when possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Consideration**: We first look at each agent's top preferences and try to ensure each agent receives at least one of their highly valued items.

2. **Allocations**:
   - **Agent 0**: Values item 2 highly (87), so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
   - **Agent 1**: Values item 3 highly (95), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
   - **Agent 2**: Values item 1 highly (81), so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
   - **Agent 3**: Values item 4 highly (96), so we allocate item 4 to agent 3.
   - **Agent 4**: Values item 7 highly (51), so we allocate item 7 to agent 4.
   - **Agent 5**: Values item 1 highly (87) which is already taken, so we allocate item 5 (62) to agent 5.

3. **Remaining Items**: The remaining items are 0 and 6. We distribute these remaining items considering the next highest preferences.
   - **Agent 0**: Values item 0 (43) more than item 6 (50), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
   - **Agent 5**: Values item 6 (11) as the next available option over the others already taken, so we allocate item 6 to agent 5.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and we aim to minimize envy by giving each agent one of their top choices where possible.
