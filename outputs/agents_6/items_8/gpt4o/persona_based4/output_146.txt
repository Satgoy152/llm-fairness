Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  38   1   6  26  36  20  14
1  62  88  18  34  63  16  48  45
2  34  16   8  60  90   1  46  65
3  77  18  33  27  45  61  22  20
4   7  26  27  15   3  10   5  49
5  30  56  50  48  94  60  48  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent gets an integer number of items and no more than 8 items in total are allocated. While perfect envy-freeness may not always be possible, we can strive for a solution that minimizes envy and distributes the items equitably based on agent valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (79) and moderately values item 1 (38).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (88) and moderately values item 4 (63).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (90) and moderately values item 3 (60).
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 (77) the most.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 (49) the most.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 4 (94) and moderately values item 5 (60).

Given these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Assign item 0** to Agent 0 (high value of 79).
- **Assign item 1** to Agent 1 (high value of 88).
- **Assign item 3** to Agent 2 (moderate value of 60).
- **Assign item 4** to Agent 5 (high value of 94).
- **Assign item 7** to Agent 4 (high value of 49).
- **Assign item 5** to Agent 3 (moderate value of 61).
- **Assign item 6** to Agent 1 (moderate value of 48).
- **Assign item 2** to Agent 5 (moderate value of 50).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences and ensures that all 8 items are distributed fairly, considering their valuations.
