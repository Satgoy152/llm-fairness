Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  81  84  15  87  72  48  63
1  69  52  14  72  46  30  94  53
2  45  90  90  44   3  67  15  20
3  91  10  98  16  83   3  69  90
4  35  19  91   1  57  95  12  24
5  98  30  21  95  10  46  92  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents in a way that aims for envy-freeness, we should first consider the valuations of each agent for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another's allocation to their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with constraints like integer allocations and a limited number of items, we will aim to minimize envy as much as possible.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is for Agent 5 (98).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is for Agent 2 (90).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is for Agent 3 (98).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is for Agent 5 (95), but Agent 1 also values it highly (72).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is for Agent 0 (87).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is for Agent 4 (95).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is for Agent 1 (94).
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is for Agent 3 (90).

Considering these preferences, we can try to allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2 and Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 0 and Item 3

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly and to distribute the items fairly across all agents. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible with the given constraints, but this allocation minimizes potential envy by matching high-value items to agents.
