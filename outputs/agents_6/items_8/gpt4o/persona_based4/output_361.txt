Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  74  90  73   9  36  37  10
1  83  13  17  38  87  70  93  73
2  44  46  51  23  12  63   2  43
3  74  63  21   5  15  48  40  99
4  88  78  27   8  80  57  53  18
5  35  20  45  54  62  29   7   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 20 45 54 62 29  7  0]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives to ensure a fair division that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. This approach tries to allocate items such that the least happy agent is as happy as possible.

Let's compute a fair allocation of the items:

1. **Agent 0** will receive items [2, 0] with a total value of 90 + 79 = 169.
2. **Agent 1** will receive items [6, 4] with a total value of 93 + 87 = 180.
3. **Agent 2** will receive item [5] with a total value of 63.
4. **Agent 3** will receive item [7] with a total value of 99.
5. **Agent 4** will receive items [1] with a total value of 78.
6. **Agent 5** will receive item [3] with a total value of 54.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and we distribute all 8 items. The allocation aims to balance the values fairly, maximizing the minimum satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```
