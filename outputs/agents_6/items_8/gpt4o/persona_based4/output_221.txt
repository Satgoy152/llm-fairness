Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  93  62  78  97  62  94  11
1   4  52  99  29  63   9  26  14
2  68  68  71  76  36  64   9  37
3   8   7  62  85  49  30  46  50
4  49  27  55  50  45  92  10  54
5   5  83  60  87  57  51  53   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of the items for each agent. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received an equitable share, minimizing envy among the agents.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate items by considering which agent values each item the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (where possible) and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: This helps us determine which items are most desired by each agent.
   
2. **Allocate items greedily based on highest valuations**: Given that each item must be allocated, we start by allocating the highest valued items to their respective agents.

3. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items**: Given there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We need to ensure the allocations are as balanced as possible.

4. **Check for envy-freeness**: Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure no agent envies another's allocation, within the constraints.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 values item 2 significantly.
- Agent 2 values items 3 and 5 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 6.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly but weâ€™ve already allocated it to Agent 2, so we need to consider their next best option.
- Agent 5 has high valuation for item 1.

Here is a possible allocation that respects these observations and is reasonably fair:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3, 5]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [1, 7]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
```
