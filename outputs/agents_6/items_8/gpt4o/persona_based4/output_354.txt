Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  34  65  85   0  39  60  36
1  37  73  67  82  31  50  18  54
2  57  22   8   9   9  22  71  16
3  58  27  78  99  43  44  49  40
4  84  16  11  34  38  77  33  54
5  50  27  47  69   8  78  77  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while trying to ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences. Given the constraints and the problem of envy-freeness, a common approach is to use a round-robin method or similar heuristic, ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items while maximizing their individual valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values items 3 and 0 highly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 2, the next highest, to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 highly, but it's taken, so we allocate item 5, their next highest, to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 highly, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 5.

Now we allocate the remaining two items:

- Item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
- Item 4 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has no other item and item 4 has a non-zero valuation for them).

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the individual valuations and distribute items fairly among the agents.
