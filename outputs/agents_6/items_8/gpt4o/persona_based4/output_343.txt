Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  99  65  21   2  60  24  64
1  91  19  37  71  27  89  66  34
2  71  49  12  97  24  21  84  79
3  85  82  99  44   2  97  72  80
4  15  74  53  54  31  77  43  76
5  17   7  45   7  26   5   6  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item. One approach is to use the method of maximum marginal utility, where each agent is assigned the item that maximizes their individual utility until all items are allocated. This method attempts to balance the distribution according to each agent's preferences.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 1 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (91).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 3 (97).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 2 (99).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 5 (77).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 7 (70).

Now, we've allocated 6 items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. We need to allocate 2 more items.

7. **Remaining Items**: Items 4 and 6.

Now letâ€™s distribute these remaining items:

- For item 4: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 1 (27).
- For item 6: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 2 (84).

After considering all preferences, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
