Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  53  97  85  49  71  62  36
1  37   5  31  96  92   6  39  19
2  30  11   7  27  47   7  54   1
3  79  85  28  97  96   7  40  58
4   9   7  36  73  92  79  56   1
5  53  87   3  54  83  62  85  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as the allocations of others. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be very challenging and sometimes impossible, especially with distinct valuations and an equal number of items and agents, we can aim for a fair allocation based on maximizing individual valuations.

Given the valuations table, let's first try to allocate items by maximizing each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring that all items are distributed. One approach is to iterate through each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, provided that this does not lead to an imbalance in the number of items each agent receives.

Here's a heuristic allocation approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Assign items to agents starting with the agent who values a specific item the most, ensuring each agent gets an approximately equal number of items.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (79).
- Item 1: Agent 5 values it the most (87).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (97).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (97).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (96).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (71).
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (85).
- Item 7: Agent 5 values it the most (95).

After assigning based on the highest valuation, we need to ensure each agent is considered, and the allocations are balanced:

- Agent 0: [2, 5]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [1, 6, 7]

Now, let's adjust to ensure every agent gets at least one item, if possible, and balance the allocation:

- Give item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation after Agent 5).
- Give item 4 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation after Agent 3).

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 5]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0, 3]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [1, 7]

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that every item is allocated, and attempts to balance the perceived fairness based on individual valuations. Note that Agent 2 receives no items due to their consistently low valuations across the board.
