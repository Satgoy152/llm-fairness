Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  11  84  64  66  69  68  54
1   1  51  96  55  84  73  83  71
2  28  73  60  52  95  80  52  11
3  82  29  46  96  92  52  69  54
4  97  18  38  48  35  12  94  99
5  94  67  85   0  95  21  45  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. A common approach is to use an algorithm such as the Envy-Free Matching or Adjusted Winner Procedure to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible.

One way to allocate the items is to ensure that each agent receives items that are relatively high in their personal valuation. Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives, based on their individual preferences:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 7.
- Agent 5 gets no items.

This approach attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent regarding their allocation, considering the constraints. Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their personal valuation given the constraints.
