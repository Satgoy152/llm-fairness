Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  93   8  45  90  92  79  84
1  30   2  14  31  39  58  35  49
2  84  19  10  97  89  53  75  15
3  33  61  60  33  31  20  20  80
4  22  64  59  57  27  57  16  93
5  53  11   8  54  52   5  25  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and distribute them such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, one approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and make an allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 4, 5, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has relatively lower valuations across all items compared to other agents.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the highest.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 highly as well.
6. Agent 5 has moderate valuations, but item 3 is valued at 54, the highest for them.

Based on these observations, we can try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that no agent envies another.

Proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5 (high total value for Agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (relatively high value for Agent 1, given their low valuations)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (highest value for Agent 2)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (moderate value, but other high-value items are taken)
- Agent 4: Items 7 (highest value for Agent 4)
- Agent 5: Items 2, 6 (maximizes Agent 5's total value with remaining items)

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's valuation of their assigned items while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```
