Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  39  80  48  49  64  61   6
1  65  37   2  74  41  47  36  24
2  85  78  94  11  41  58   1  13
3  87  70  49  78  58   7  12  19
4  17  25  94  49   4  22  50  97
5  19  72  38  88  64  45  38  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we must take into account the valuations provided in the table. Our goal is to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, meaning each agent should feel that their allocated items are at least as valuable as those allocated to any other agent, from their own perspective.

Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Here, we attempt to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 highly (80), so we assign it to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 highly (65), so we assign it to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highly, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 0 (85), but it's taken by Agent 1. Their next choice is item 1 (78).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 (87), item 1 (70), and item 3 (78) highly. Allocating item 3 to them.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 7 highly (97), so we assign it to them.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 highly (88), but it's taken. Next is item 1 (72), but it's taken. Their next choice is item 4 (64).

With these assignments, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items and ensure that each agent has a fair share:

7. **Agent 0**: Already has item 2. They value item 5 (64) next highest among unallocated items.
8. **Agent 2**: Already has item 1. They value item 4 (41), but it's taken. Next is item 6 (1) among unallocated, which is low for all.
9. **Agent 3**: Already has item 3. They value item 4 (58), taken by Agent 5. Next is item 6 (12).
10. **Agent 5**: Already has item 4. They value item 5 (45) next highest among unallocated items.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on each agent's individual valuations, while ensuring all items are assigned.
