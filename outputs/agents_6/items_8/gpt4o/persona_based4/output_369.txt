Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  60  39   4  14  20  87  79
1  14  26   7  27  66  35  99  99
2  42  10  91  53  71  36  52  18
3  57  80  87  18  31  39  49   0
4  60  43  78  37  57  15  30  51
5  40  37  82  77   3  10  79  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that attempts to achieve fairness and minimize envy, we need to consider the valuations provided by the agents for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels their allocation is fair based on their own valuations.

Let's consider a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 highly with a valuation of 87 and item 7 with 79. Assign these items to Agent 0 to maximize their happiness.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values items 6 and 7 the most (at 99 each), but since these are already taken, we choose the next highest valued items, 4 (66) and 5 (35), for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 2 at 91. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 to satisfy them with their highest-valued item.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1 (80) and 2 (87), but since item 2 is already allocated, we assign item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest-valued item for Agent 4 is item 0 with a valuation of 60. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 2 (82), which is already taken, so we allocate the next highest available item, item 3 (77), to Agent 5.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Item 3

This allocation uses all 8 items and attempts to satisfy each agent based on their highest available valuations.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```
