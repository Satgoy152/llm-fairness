Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  84  30   1  61  38  90  90
1  72  47  35  69  66  87  29   1
2  83  28  41  61   2  50  22  51
3  10  51   4  26  44  49  80   0
4  45  56   4   1   5  97  97  56
5  96  73  47  22  86  29  59  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to assign items in such a way that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to the others, minimizing envy.

One approach to achieve this is to use the "maximum envy-free allocation" strategy, where we try to minimize the maximum envy that any agent feels towards another. Since we have 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we'll distribute them to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values items 6 and 7 highly (both valued at 90). Assigning these items to Agent 0 will maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** has a high value for item 5 (valued at 87). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (valued at 83). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 highly (valued at 80), but it has been assigned to Agent 0. The next highest value is item 5, but it has been assigned to Agent 1. Item 1 is valued at 51, which is the highest available for Agent 3. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the highest (valued at 97), but it has been assigned to Agent 1. The next highest value is item 6, which is also taken. The highest available are items 1 and 7, with item 7 being valued at 56. Assign item 7 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 0 (valued at 96), but it is assigned to Agent 2. Their next highest valuation is item 4 (valued at 86). Assign item 4 to Agent 5.

Now, we have assigned 6 items. Two items remain unassigned: item 2 and item 3.

Let's handle the remaining items:
- **Item 2**: The highest unassigned valuation is by Agent 5 (valued at 47). Assign item 2 to Agent 5.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 has a valuation of 69, which is the highest remaining. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy each agent based on their highest available valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
