Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  49  99  54  65  24  62  63
1  57  92   4  18  68  31   0  60
2  20  81   1   6  92  35  59  18
3  69  91  22  41  64  68  56  78
4  63  16  95  50  61  85  33  54
5  48  90  15  22  14  77  75  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation (a form of envy-freeness), we can consider the valuations of each item by every agent and attempt to distribute them in a balanced manner. One approach is to use an envy-free allocation method such as the "round robin" or "envy-free up to one good" approach, but due to the constraints of this problem, I'll provide an allocation that attempts to balance the distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign items to agents by considering their highest-valued items first, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
- Try to balance total value received by each agent as best as possible.

Allocation steps:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (highest value among all agents for any item).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (second highest value).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (highest available value after previous assignments).
4. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (highest available value).
5. Assign item 6 to agent 5 (highest available value).
6. Assign item 0 to agent 3 (next highest value for remaining items).
7. Assign item 7 to agent 4 (next highest value for remaining items).
8. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (next highest value for remaining items).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations, within the constraint of distributing all 8 items. However, achieving complete envy-freeness might not be possible in every case, especially with integer constraints.
