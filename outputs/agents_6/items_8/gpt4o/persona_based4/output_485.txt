Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  75  79  18  43   7  95  25
1  58  25  11  86  53  76  58  21
2  16  78  19  52   8  34  73  98
3  32  96  76  26  26  63  12  47
4  97  87  61  23  62  57  87  75
5  59  18  64  30  79  61  33  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness (or minimizing envy), we can utilize a method like the "round-robin" or "max-min" approach. The idea is to distribute items in a manner that each agent receives items they value highly, while trying to balance the overall value each agent receives.

Given the values each agent assigns to each item, let's proceed with an allocation that considers these valuations:

1. Start by calculating the total value each agent gives to all items, which can guide us in ensuring balance.
2. Sort the items for each agent based on their valuations in descending order.
3. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values the next highest item the most, ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item, if possible.

Let's implement this:

- Agent 0's total valuations: 428
- Agent 1's total valuations: 388
- Agent 2's total valuations: 378
- Agent 3's total valuations: 378
- Agent 4's total valuations: 549
- Agent 5's total valuations: 442

Here's a possible fair allocation considering the values:

1. Agent 0: Item 6 (value 95)
2. Agent 1: Item 3 (value 86)
3. Agent 2: Item 7 (value 98)
4. Agent 3: Item 1 (value 96)
5. Agent 4: Item 0 (value 97)
6. Agent 5: Item 4 (value 79)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2 items left):

7. Agent 4: Item 5 (value 57)
8. Agent 5: Item 2 (value 64)

This allocation intends to balance the distribution of high-valued items among the agents, reducing overall envy.

The allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 5],
    "5": [4, 2]
}
```
