Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  50  50  26  54  36  29  99
1  15  97  17  39  13  61  19  14
2  26  45   8  99  45  36  25   0
3  18  85  86  11  69  54  87  40
4  85  30  51  54  23  87  37  17
5  24  32  31  62  30  25  72  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach to such problems is to use algorithms that aim for an envy-free allocation, such as the Adjusted Winner procedure, the Selfridgeâ€“Conway procedure, or a round-robin allocation based on preferences. Given the complexity of achieving true envy-freeness with integer allocations, a round-robin or priority-based method might be practical here.

Let's proceed with a simple round-robin allocation based on the highest value each agent places on the remaining items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 the most at 99.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most at 97.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most at 99.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the most at 87.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the most at 87.
6. **Agent 5** values item 6 the most at 72, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 7 at 68, but it's also taken. Then item 3 at 62, but it's taken. The next available highest is item 4 at 30.

After the first round of allocation, we still have the items 0, 2, 4 remaining. Let's proceed with another round:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the most at 54.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most at 17.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most at 26, but it's already taken. The next available highest is item 2 at 8, but it's already taken. The next available highest is item 4 at 45, but it's already taken. All available items are taken, thus no assignment for this round.
4. **Agent 3** also has all higher valued items taken.
5. **Agent 4** also has all higher valued items taken.
6. **Agent 5** also has all higher valued items taken.

Now all items are allocated. Let's summarize the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and we have attempted to prioritize allocations based on the highest value each agent places on the items.
