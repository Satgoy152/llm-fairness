Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95   1   3  33   1  59  41  41
1  61  79  64  78  82  64   8  61
2   5  37  89  41  55  58  58  46
3   7  62  44   1  14   3  42  98
4  31  31  43  32  90  96  52  82
5  40  23  51  12  20  49  43  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's preferences and try to balance the allocations such that no agent envies another. Given the matrix of valuations, we will allocate the items to ensure all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

To achieve this, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences**: Look for items with high valuations for each agent and prioritize giving these items to the respective agents if possible.
2. **Balance Total Value**: Try to balance the total value of items received by each agent to minimize envy.
3. **Ensure Complete Allocation**: Make sure all items are allocated once and only once.

Following this approach, let's try to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values items 4 and 3 highly, so allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 7 highly, so allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4** values item 5 highly, so allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
- **Agent 5** can be allocated item 1, which is not highly valued by others but is the best available for Agent 5 given the allocations above.
- **Agent 4** can also receive item 6, as it aligns with a reasonable value distribution.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuations are balanced as much as possible given the constraints.
