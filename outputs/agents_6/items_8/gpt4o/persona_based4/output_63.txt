Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  86  63  42  83  33  80  63
1  59   2  81  91  61  87  73  36
2  64   0   8  32   9  86  50  10
3  96  86  42  46   6  97  94  12
4  96  65  29  45  72  44   2   2
5  51  45  68  86  99  25  90  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, a potential approach is to use a method that strives for envy-freeness and efficiency. One common method is the "Round Robin" approach or similar fair division algorithms that try to maximize the minimum satisfaction (min-max fairness).

Here is a possible allocation of the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Given the highest value items for Agent 0: item 1 (value 86) and item 6 (value 80).

2. **Agent 1:** Given the highest value items for Agent 1: item 3 (value 91) and item 5 (value 87).

3. **Agent 2:** Given the highest value items for Agent 2: item 5 (value 86) and one more low-value item, say item 2 (value 8).

4. **Agent 3:** Given the highest value items for Agent 3: item 5 (value 97) and item 0 (value 96).

5. **Agent 4:** Given the highest value items for Agent 4: item 0 (value 96) and item 4 (value 72).

6. **Agent 5:** Given the highest value items for Agent 5: item 4 (value 99) and item 6 (value 90).

However, given that each agent must receive a whole number of items and exactly 8 items in total must be allocated, we can adjust as follows to ensure every agent gets at least one high-value item they desire while balancing the overall distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent will receive at least one item, and a total of 8 items are distributed among the agents. This allocation aims to be fair, considering the agents' preferences based on their valuations of the items.
