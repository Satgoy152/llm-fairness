Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  91  61  33  56  15  11  81
1   2  96  97  44  34  68  41  19
2  70  40  30  87  77  57  64  83
3  14  43  53  85  16  37  73  32
4  75  69  79  32  34  95  88  38
5   7  52  70  68  71  86  76  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 52 70 68 71 86 76 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This method aims to maximize the product of the utilities of all agents, which often leads to a fair allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [76, 91, 61, 33, 56, 15, 11, 81]
Agent 1: [2, 96, 97, 44, 34, 68, 41, 19]
Agent 2: [70, 40, 30, 87, 77, 57, 64, 83]
Agent 3: [14, 43, 53, 85, 16, 37, 73, 32]
Agent 4: [75, 69, 79, 32, 34, 95, 88, 38]
Agent 5: [7, 52, 70, 68, 71, 86, 76, 73]
```

We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, but not more than two, because there are 8 items and 6 agents. 

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it's their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it's their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it's their highest valued item.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 4, which is their highest valued item available after the above allocations.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 5, which is their highest valued item available.
6. Assign item 7 to Agent 2, their next highest after item 3.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 4, their next highest valued item.
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as it is their highest available.

This allocation attempts to give each agent their most valued items while maintaining balance and fairness. 

The resulting allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [5]
}
```
