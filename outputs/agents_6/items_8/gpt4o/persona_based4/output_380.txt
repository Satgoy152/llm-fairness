Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48   6  75  57  99  12  42  78
1  23  44  73  24   1   5  49  15
2  13  63  98  31   8  90  73  34
3  78  53  26  19  28  48  57  98
4  96  95  25  45   8  94  62  14
5  14  67  40  13  26  23   3  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes the total value each agent receives according to their individual valuations. Given the valuations table, we will try to allocate items to agents such that each agent's allocation is as close as possible to their most desired items.

We will use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on their value to each agent. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 4** is highly valued by Agent 0 (99), so we assign it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2** is highly valued by Agent 2 (98), so we assign it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 7** is highly valued by Agent 3 (98), so we assign it to Agent 3.
4. **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 4 (96), so we assign it to Agent 4.
5. **Item 6** is highly valued by Agent 2 (73, second highest), so we assign it to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5** is highly valued by Agent 2 (90, third highest), so we assign it to Agent 2.
7. **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 4 (95), so we assign it to Agent 4.
8. **Item 3** is highly valued by Agent 0 (57, second highest), so we assign it to Agent 0.

The allocations can be represented in the JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 5, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and the allocation is based on maximizing agents' valuations for the items assigned to them.
