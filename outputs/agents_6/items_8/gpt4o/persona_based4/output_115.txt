Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  41  27  49  20  41  69  89
1   0  14  55  85  64  87  22  34
2  82  52   7  17  27  10  84  86
3  56  79  78  62  33  91  88  89
4  81  51  24  37   8  21  51   8
5  10  76  34  80  97  34  86  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and provides a balanced distribution of value. We need to ensure that each agent receives a portion of the total value that is as equal as possible.

Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will inevitably receive more than one item. Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**  
   The total value each agent has for all items is as follows:
   - Agent 0: 420
   - Agent 1: 361
   - Agent 2: 365
   - Agent 3: 576
   - Agent 4: 281
   - Agent 5: 471

2. **Determine Fair Share:**  
   The fair share of value for each agent should be approximately equal, considering some may receive more items. The total value of all items is 2474, so each agent's fair share is about 412.33.

3. **Allocate Items to Minimize Envy:**  
   We will allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total value while minimizing any imbalance in their total received value.

The allocation is as follows:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 6]  
  Total Value: 153

- **Agent 1:** [3, 5]  
  Total Value: 172

- **Agent 2:** [7]  
  Total Value: 86

- **Agent 3:** [1, 2]  
  Total Value: 157

- **Agent 4:** [4]  
  Total Value: 8

- **Agent 5:** [5]  
  Total Value: 97

4. **Re-evaluation for Balance:**  
Since Agent 4 has received the least value, we will reallocate to ensure a more balanced distribution. Let's adjust as follows:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 6]  
- **Agent 1:** [3]  
- **Agent 2:** [7]  
- **Agent 3:** [1, 2]  
- **Agent 4:** [5]  
- **Agent 5:** [4]

5. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation tries to minimize envy by considering both the total and individual item values to each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
