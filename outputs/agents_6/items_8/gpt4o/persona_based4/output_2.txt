Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  64  56   7  25  91  61  26
1  38  57  29  11  84  66  96  84
2  58  42  37  34  55   9  30  29
3  73  50  86  22  82  58  58  17
4  92  81  23  23  46  65  46  15
5  76   9  26   6  47  19  59  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free division as much as possible. In this context, an envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Let's analyze the table and allocate the items accordingly:

First, we calculate the sum of the valuations for each agent to understand the total value they perceive from all items:

- Agent 0: 77 + 64 + 56 + 7 + 25 + 91 + 61 + 26 = 407
- Agent 1: 38 + 57 + 29 + 11 + 84 + 66 + 96 + 84 = 465
- Agent 2: 58 + 42 + 37 + 34 + 55 + 9 + 30 + 29 = 294
- Agent 3: 73 + 50 + 86 + 22 + 82 + 58 + 58 + 17 = 446
- Agent 4: 92 + 81 + 23 + 23 + 46 + 65 + 46 + 15 = 391
- Agent 5: 76 + 9 + 26 + 6 + 47 + 19 + 59 + 27 = 269

Now, let's allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the most (91). Allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the most (96). Allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most (58). Allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the most (86). Allocate item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 the most (92), but it is taken. Next best is item 1 (81). Allocate item 1 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 0 the most (76), but it is taken. Next best is item 6 (59), but it is taken. Next, item 4 (47). Allocate item 4 to agent 5.

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- Items 3 and 7 are left. We will allocate them to the agents with the least total value from their current allocations.

Agent 0 has item 5 (91), agent 1 has item 6 (96), agent 2 has item 0 (58), agent 3 has item 2 (86), agent 4 has item 1 (81), and agent 5 has item 4 (47).

The remaining items (3 and 7) can be allocated to agents 2 and 5 (since they have the least total value so far):

- **Agent 2**: Add item 3 (34).
- **Agent 5**: Add item 7 (27).

Now each agent has a fair allocation, considering their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 7]
}
```
