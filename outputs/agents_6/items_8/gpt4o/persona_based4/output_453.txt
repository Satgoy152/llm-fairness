Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  62  52  15  98  92   3  36
1  49  57  96  50  49   0  60  38
2  84  94  34  65  47  70  93  64
3  59   1   1  45  77   9  41   7
4  81  85  74  98  56  20  69  14
5  33  15  18  41  38  34  96  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that respects the principles of fair division and envy-freeness. One of the common methods is to use a variant of the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" process, where agents take turns picking items according to their preferences. However, since we aim for an envy-free division, we should consider the valuations and try to balance them so that no agent envies another's allocation.

Firstly, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences better:

- Agent 0: 58 + 62 + 52 + 15 + 98 + 92 + 3 + 36 = 416
- Agent 1: 49 + 57 + 96 + 50 + 49 + 0 + 60 + 38 = 399
- Agent 2: 84 + 94 + 34 + 65 + 47 + 70 + 93 + 64 = 551
- Agent 3: 59 + 1 + 1 + 45 + 77 + 9 + 41 + 7 = 240
- Agent 4: 81 + 85 + 74 + 98 + 56 + 20 + 69 + 14 = 497
- Agent 5: 33 + 15 + 18 + 41 + 38 + 34 + 96 + 35 = 310

Given these total valuations, we can try to distribute items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while minimizing possible envy among them. To do this, we can allocate the items in a manner that attempts to give each agent their most valued items, balancing the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 2 values item 6 highly (93) and has the highest total valuation, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 4 values item 3 highly (98), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
3. Agent 0 values item 4 highly (98), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1 values item 2 highly (96), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 5 values item 6 highly (96), but since it's already allocated, we give Agent 5 item 5 (34) as a compromise.
6. Agent 3 values item 4 highly (77), but since it's already allocated, we give Agent 3 item 0 (59) as a compromise.
7. Allocating remaining items: Item 1 and item 7 are left.

To ensure all agents are considered and all items are allocated, we need to distribute the remaining items:
- Agent 2: Item 1 is the next highest valued unallocated item (94), so we allocate it to Agent 2.
- Agent 0: Item 7 is the next highest valued unallocated item (36), so we allocate it to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and we attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```
