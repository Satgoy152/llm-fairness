Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  14  88  63  39  42  28  91
1  93  11  22  58  26   8  74  49
2  61  41  58  71  78  33  26  48
3  48  47  45  73  57  39  61  89
4   3  28  93   5  60  62  51  16
5  49  62  28  46  23  78  69  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that aims for fairness and minimizes envy, we'll consider each agent's valuation of each item and try to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. A common approach is to leverage the concept of the maximum marginal utility, where each agent is assigned items that provide them the highest relative value compared to others.

Given the valuations table, we will attempt to allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 2 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 7.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 2.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 5.

Let's allocate items based on these observations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item to maintain fairness and that all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 2, 7
2. **Agent 1**: Item 0
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3
5. **Agent 4**: Item 6
6. **Agent 5**: Items 1, 5

This allocation considers each agent's top preferences and ensures that all items are allocated while aiming to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
