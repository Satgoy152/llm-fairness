Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  33  81   1   7  71  76   2
1  74  21  50   2  53  59   2  81
2  23  39  67  29  75  34  79   3
3   0  63  49  78  61  85  27  15
4  34  89   3  31  83  61  38  22
5  79  88  11  85   9  20  50  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division, we will aim for an allocation where each agent receives items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This means that each agent should value their bundle of items at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle.

To start, let's allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We will attempt to distribute items in a way that balances these valuations across agents.

### Valuation Matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  33  81   1   7  71  76   2
1  74  21  50   2  53  59   2  81
2  23  39  67  29  75  34  79   3
3   0  63  49  78  61  85  27  15
4  34  89   3  31  83  61  38  22
5  79  88  11  85   9  20  50  37
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. For each agent, identify the item that they value the most.
2. Allocate that item to the agent unless it's already allocated.
3. If an item is already allocated, find the next best available item for that agent.
4. Repeat until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Execution:
- **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (81), so allocate item 2.
- **Agent 1** values item 7 the most (81), so allocate item 7.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (79), so allocate item 6.
- **Agent 3** values item 5 the most (85), so allocate item 5.
- **Agent 4** values item 1 the most (89), so allocate item 1.
- **Agent 5** values item 0 the most (79), so allocate item 0.

Now, we have the following allocation:
- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7

Remaining items to allocate are 3 and 4.

Since agents have already received their most valued items, we can distribute the remaining items to agents such that it balances the overall values each agent receives.

- Allocate item 3 to **Agent 3**, as they have a high value for it (78).
- Allocate item 4 to **Agent 4**, as they have a high value for it (83).

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they highly value, aiming to minimize envy across agents.
