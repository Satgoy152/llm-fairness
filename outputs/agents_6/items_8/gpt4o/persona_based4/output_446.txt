Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  49   4  57  79  14  47  59
1  90  31  20  68  40  77  75  80
2  41  28  76  67  77  67  85   4
3  84  41  51  63   8  15  39  69
4  79  83  89  11  72   9  68  56
5  90   2  65  15  29  34  59   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an approach that aims to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive. We will attempt to distribute the items so that each agent receives a collection of items that cumulatively have similar valuations for each agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The items that maximize Agent 0's valuation are 3 (57), 7 (59), and 4 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: The items that maximize Agent 1's valuation are 0 (90) and 5 (77).
3. **Agent 2**: The items that maximize Agent 2's valuation are 6 (85).
4. **Agent 3**: The items that maximize Agent 3's valuation are 1 (41).
5. **Agent 4**: The items that maximize Agent 4's valuation are 2 (89).
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 will not receive any items, as the fair distribution of high-value items to other agents leaves no remaining items.

Thus, the allocation can be represented in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items, ensures each agent has a collection of items with decent valuation to them, and aims to reduce envy among agents.
