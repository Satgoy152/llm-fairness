Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  30  55  81  66  83  73  88
1  23  49  36  68  29  55  27  51
2  37  14  50  42  59  86  53  47
3   0  16  13  52   2  52  10  95
4  41  55  20  54  78   1  78  80
5  43  39  48  77  47  65  73   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets an allocation they value as highly as possible, given the constraints that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

One common approach to achieve envy-freeness is to use a round-robin or a bidding procedure, but given the complexity of ensuring fair division with integer constraints and a small number of agents and items, we will instead manually distribute the items in a way that appears to balance total valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Highest Valuation Per Agent:** Initially, try to allocate each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. **Balance Total Valuations:** Ensure that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible across all agents.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If there's a significant imbalance, adjust allocations to minimize envy.

### Initial Assessment:
- Agent 0: Values item 7 the highest at 88.
- Agent 1: Values item 3 the highest at 68.
- Agent 2: Values item 5 the highest at 86.
- Agent 3: Values item 7 the highest at 95, but agent 0 also highly values it.
- Agent 4: Values item 4 the highest at 78.
- Agent 5: Values item 3 the highest at 77, but agent 1 also highly values it.

### Allocation:
To ensure each agent receives at least one item and to balance total valuations, we'll proceed as follows:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (highest valuation of 95).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 86).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 5 (second highest at 77 after Agent 3).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (highest valuation of 78).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation of 16).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 49).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation of 55).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (next highest valuation of 73).

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers both individual preferences and a balance of total valuations, while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent receives at least one item.
