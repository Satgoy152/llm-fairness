Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  27  44  94  88  82  99  51
1  56  88   0   9  34  23  21  26
2  94  18  71  52  87  18  10  90
3  20  63  21  68  61  73  91  11
4  74  84  97  37  91  22  76  51
5  26  48  16  54  44   4  50  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the distribution is as equitable as possible, taking into account each agent's valuation. One common approach to achieve this is to use the "max-min" fairness strategy, where we try to maximize the minimum value each agent receives.

First, let's determine the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 73 + 27 + 44 + 94 + 88 + 82 + 99 + 51 = 558
- Agent 1: 56 + 88 + 0 + 9 + 34 + 23 + 21 + 26 = 257
- Agent 2: 94 + 18 + 71 + 52 + 87 + 18 + 10 + 90 = 440
- Agent 3: 20 + 63 + 21 + 68 + 61 + 73 + 91 + 11 = 408
- Agent 4: 74 + 84 + 97 + 37 + 91 + 22 + 76 + 51 = 532
- Agent 5: 26 + 48 + 16 + 54 + 44 + 4 + 50 + 89 = 331

Next, to achieve a fair division, we will allocate items in a manner that maximizes the minimum valuation received by any agent, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Allocate items in a way that tries to balance the perceived value across agents.
2. Consider each agent's highest-valued items first to maximize their satisfaction.

Following this approach, we can create the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6] (Value = 73 + 99 = 172)
- Agent 1: Items [1] (Value = 88)
- Agent 2: Items [2, 7] (Value = 71 + 90 = 161)
- Agent 3: Items [3] (Value = 68)
- Agent 4: Items [4] (Value = 91)
- Agent 5: Items [5] (Value = 4)

By using this allocation, we try to balance the values perceived by the agents, given their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
