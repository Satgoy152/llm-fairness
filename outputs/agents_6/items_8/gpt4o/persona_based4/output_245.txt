Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  11  74  93  51  15  49  27
1  52  68  31  84  10  26  57  56
2  19  26  90  50  52  97  76  69
3  11  70  54  58  81  16   6  28
4  85  22  89  81  82  66  40  92
5  68  73  49  57  62  29  15  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach. This involves each agent choosing the item they value the most from the remaining items, in a sequential manner. 

Given the valuations provided, we will proceed to allocate items in a way that considers maximizing each agent's total value, aiming for fairness and envy-freeness.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (but it’s already taken), so next highest is item 1 (68).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (97).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (81).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (85).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (but it’s already taken), so next highest is item 1 (73).

Second round, considering remaining items:
1. **Agent 0**: Highest remaining is item 2 (74).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest remaining is item 6 (57).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest remaining is item 6 (but it’s already taken), so next highest is item 7 (69).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest remaining is item 2 (but it’s already taken), so next highest is item 7 (28).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest remaining is item 4 (but it’s already taken), so next highest is item 7 (92).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest remaining is item 0 (but it’s already taken), so next highest is item 4 (62).

After these rounds, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing each agent's total value based on remaining available items during each selection round.
