Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  41  76  27  68  99  44  93
1   9   0  54   6  64   2  32  84
2   1  27   3  72   4  55   2  52
3  63  89  88  95  73  18  56  82
4  62  38  29  96  74   6   3  95
5   5  97  96  49  36  15  64  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free solution. This means each agent should feel that they have received the best possible allocation given their preferences. Let's perform the allocation by considering the agents' valuations and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Steps for Fair Allocation:

1. **Valuation Matrix:**
   - Agent valuations for each item are given in the matrix.

2. **Prioritize High Valuations:**
   - We will try to allocate items to agents who value them the most first, ensuring that no agent is significantly envious of another.

3. **Distribute Items:**
   - Distribute the items to balance the total value across agents.

4. **Check Fairness:**
   - Ensure each agent receives a fair share of total value or close to it.

Here is a proposed allocation based on the valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Receives items [0, 1]
  - Total value = 31 (item 0) + 41 (item 1) = 72

- **Agent 1:** Receives items [7]
  - Total value = 84 (item 7)

- **Agent 2:** Receives items [3]
  - Total value = 72 (item 3)

- **Agent 3:** Receives items [2]
  - Total value = 88 (item 2)

- **Agent 4:** Receives items [4, 5]
  - Total value = 74 (item 4) + 6 (item 5) = 80

- **Agent 5:** Receives items [6]
  - Total value = 64 (item 6)

The allocation is designed to balance the total value received by each agent, minimizing envy. The total values are relatively balanced, with each agent receiving items they value highly.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed and each agent receives items according to their preferences, aiming for minimal envy and fairness.
