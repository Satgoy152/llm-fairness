Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  64  88  26  94  97   7  90
1  26  72  94  60  42  23  73  82
2  59  49   1  47  89  54  77  40
3  87  47  50  32  31  41  92  48
4  89  73  65   7  20  75  29  11
5  85  99  98  10  25  98  46  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible and each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations, we can attempt a fair division based on maximizing the total value each agent receives, while trying to minimize envy.

Here are the steps I used to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Start by identifying which items each agent values highly, ensuring that these items are not overly coveted by all agents to prevent envy.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Try to assign each agent at least one item according to their preferences, while considering the preferences of others to avoid giving two agents the same item.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: After an initial allocation, adjust by checking if any agent is significantly disadvantaged. Re-allocate items to better balance perceived value.

4. **Ensure All Items Are Distributed**: Make sure that all 8 items are allocated among the 6 agents.

Here's a possible allocation that follows this methodology:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (highest value item for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (highest value item for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Items 5 and 6 (fairly high values and less competition)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (high value for agent 3)
- Agent 4: Items 1 and 3 (reasonable values for agent 4 and less competition)
- Agent 5: Item 7 (high value for agent 5)

Given these allocations, each agent receives some items, and the allocation tries to balance the valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation considers the individual preferences of each agent while ensuring all items are distributed and attempting to minimize envy among agents.
