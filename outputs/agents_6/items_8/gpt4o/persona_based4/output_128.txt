Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  25  73  23  93  18  78   6
1  83  34  11  35  10  17  80  67
2  82  77  25  78   4   4  60   4
3  62  76   6  22  74  17  84  75
4  45  45  62  89  83   7  15  92
5  31  36   1  56  68  11  65  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

One simple method is the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of the agents' utilities. This method often results in a fair division.

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuation for item 4 (93) and item 0 (84).
- Agent 1 has high valuation for item 6 (80) and item 7 (67).
- Agent 2 has high valuation for item 3 (78) and item 1 (77).
- Agent 3 has high valuation for item 6 (84) and item 7 (75).
- Agent 4 has high valuation for item 7 (92) and item 4 (83).
- Agent 5 has high valuation for item 4 (68) and item 6 (65).

Let's try an allocation that attempts to balance these valuations and ensure all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 4 (93) and item 0 (84). This gives Agent 0 high value items.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (80). This is the highest value item for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (78) and item 1 (77). These are high-value items for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 7 (75). This is a high-value item for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 (62). This balances out remaining values.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 5 (11). This is a lower value item, but required for allocation completion.

Now, let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation is fair in the sense that it attempts to give each agent high-value items according to their preferences, balancing the total allocation while ensuring all items are distributed.
