Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  51  29  12  61  29   8  96
1  32   1  79  66  72   9  47  88
2  35  70  53   2   2   8  56  71
3  98  92  64  80  29  69  23  41
4  90  43   0  66   1  95  73  91
5  47  54  38  29  98  94  24  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll use a strategy that maximizes the total satisfaction across agents by considering their preferences. Here, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a set of items they value highly. Let's employ a simple round-robin allocation strategy based on agents' highest valuations for the items available.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Their highest valued item is 7 (value 96). Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Their highest valued item is 2 (value 79). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Their highest valued item is 1 (value 70). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Their highest valued item is 0 (value 98). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Their highest valued item is 5 (value 95). Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5:** Their highest valued item is 4 (value 98). Assign item 4 to Agent 5.

Now, each agent has received one item. We continue allocating the remaining items:

7. **Agent 0:** The remaining highest valued item is 4 (value 61), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 0 (value 82), but it's taken too. So we go with item 6 (value 8) as it's available. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 2:** The next highest available item for Agent 2 is item 3 (value 2). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

The items have been allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
