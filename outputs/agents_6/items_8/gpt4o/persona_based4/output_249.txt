Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  86  59  47  86   5   4  35
1  22  43  41  16  63  58  59  25
2  85  69  18  51  80  25  98  77
3  97  30  71  27  93  50  42   5
4  78  22   3  31   8  69   6  71
5  30  73  16  95  15  16  43  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free distribution. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations matrix, we can apply the Adjusted Winner procedure or similar techniques to accomplish this goal. However, due to the complexity, we will use a heuristic approach for this problem.

Here is how we can allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction, while ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item, and the distribution is as fair as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 and 4 the most. Let's allocate one of them to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 and 6 highly. Let's allocate one of these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the most. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 0. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 7, which is one of their higher-valued items.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 3, which is their highest-valued item.

After initial allocations, we will assign the remaining items to ensure each agent has at least one item.

Here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (value 86)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (value 58)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (value 98)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (value 97)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (value 71)
- Agent 5: Item 3 (value 95)

For the two remaining items, let's assign them to balance the allocation:

- Agent 0: Also receives item 1 (value 86)
- Agent 1: Also receives item 2 (value 41)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to balance the total valuations fairly across all agents.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This distribution is an attempt to balance the agents' happiness based on their individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
