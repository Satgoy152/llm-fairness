Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  22  85  26  98  11  98  70
1  52  36  55  34  33  86  16  83
2   6  33  12  77  10   3  59  48
3  53  45  24  50  88  60  13  58
4  82  36  90  25  29  37  95  24
5  10  47  77  20   9  42  59  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 47 77 20  9 42 59 18]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we must ensure that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations table, let's start by examining each agent and their valuations to allocate items in a reasonable manner:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 4 and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 and 7.
3. **Agent 2** has a notably higher valuation for item 3.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly but it is already of interest to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 4** values items 2 and 6 highly.
6. **Agent 5** has a relatively high valuation for item 2.

With these observations in mind, let's allocate items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 4 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 5 and 7.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2.
- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is based on their preferences while trying to maintain fairness and minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```
