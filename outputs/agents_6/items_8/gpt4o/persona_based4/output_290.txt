Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  15   0  38  36  98  96  66
1  88  25  25  85   6  44  62   5
2  91  31   3  98  27  97  14  90
3  73  10  62   3  55  84  78  51
4  87  15  56  95  78  99  45  15
5   5  39  32  74  12  52   5  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
The problem presented is a fair division problem where we need to allocate 8 items to 6 agents based on their valuations such that the allocation is as fair as possible. We will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

To achieve this, I will use the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items.
2. Attempt to allocate one item per agent based on their highest valuation.
3. Allocate the remaining items to maximize each agent's utility while minimizing envy.

Based on the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (98), followed by item 6 (96).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (88), followed by item 3 (85).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (98), followed by item 0 (91).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (84), followed by item 6 (78).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (99), followed by item 3 (95).
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most (74), followed by item 5 (52).

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 5 to agent 4 (highest valuation 99).
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (highest remaining valuation 98).
- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (highest remaining valuation 88).
- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (highest remaining valuation 96).
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (highest remaining valuation 62).
- Assign item 1 to agent 5 (highest valuation 39 for agent 5).

Now, two items remain (4, 7):

- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (remaining highest valuation 36).
- Assign item 7 to agent 2 (remaining highest valuation 90).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and attempts to minimize envy by allocating high-value items to the respective agents.
