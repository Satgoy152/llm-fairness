Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  70  69  60  30  54  81  58
1  16  18  66  49  79  95  10  27
2  82  33  38  12  86  95  47  77
3  73  43  54   0  74  68  90  83
4  65  24  70  30  13  71  72  78
5  94  11  84  89  95   9  84  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [94 11 84 89 95  9 84 15]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and provides a balanced distribution based on their valuations. We will try to ensure that each agent has a bundle that they value highly, considering their relative preferences.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 0 (95) and item 6 (81).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 5 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 5 (95), but it’s already assigned to Agent 1. The next high-value items are item 4 (86) and item 7 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 6 (90), but it’s already assigned to Agent 0. The next high-value items are item 7 (83) and item 0 (73).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 5 (71), but it’s already assigned to Agent 1. The next high-value items are item 2 (70) and item 7 (78).
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 4 (95) and item 5 (84), but item 5 is already assigned. The next high-value item is item 2 (84).

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items 0 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 4.
- **Agent 3**: Gets item 7.
- **Agent 4**: Gets item 1.
- **Agent 5**: Gets item 2.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value perceived by each agent and minimizes envy by considering the highest available preferences.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```
