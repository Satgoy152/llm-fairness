Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  97  98  13  20  60  17   9
1  99   2  11   2   0  67  82  79
2  73  25  93  98  93  36  53  41
3  16   0  35  26  42   8   6  38
4  59  27  89  59   4  50  25  24
5  85  97  26  76   8  91  89  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents, we aim to consider envy-freeness and efficiency. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and aim to give each agent items that maximize their satisfaction.

2. Distribute items sequentially, trying to ensure no agent envies another by having fewer items of perceived higher value.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 1, and 2. Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 5, 6, and 7. Since item 0 is taken, assign items 6 and 7 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 2, 3, and 4. Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 3, 4, and 7. Since items 3 and 7 are taken, assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 5. Since item 2 is taken, assign item 5 to Agent 4.
- **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 1, 5, and 6. Since items 0, 1, 5, and 6 are already assigned, Agent 5 will not receive any items.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, minimizing envy and maximizing efficiency within the constraints of integer allocations.
