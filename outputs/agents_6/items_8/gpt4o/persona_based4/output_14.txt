Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  30  32  89  24  85  98  75
1  18  48  73  24  52  13  17  24
2  21  76   5  10  93  39  48  43
3  34  45  30  77  39  25  18  42
4   1  81  13  86   4  91  98  64
5   5  16  16  81  51  87  49  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent believes they have received the best possible set of items from their perspective. Given the varying valuations of each item by the agents, the goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items:** Look for items that have significantly higher valuations for specific agents compared to others. This can help in quickly deciding some allocations.

2. **Allocate Unique High-Valuation Items:** Assign items that have a uniquely high valuation for one agent compared to others directly to that agent.

3. **Balance Remaining Allocations:** For items with more evenly distributed valuations, try to allocate them in a way that balances the overall perceived value for each agent.

Let's execute this strategy:

- **Agent 0:** Highly values item 6 (98), item 3 (89), and item 5 (85).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 2 (73) the most.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 4 (93) the most.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 3 (77) highly, but Agent 0 values it more.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 5 (91) and item 6 (98) highly, but Agent 0 has a higher valuation for item 6.
- **Agent 5:** Values item 5 (87) highly but slightly less than Agent 4.

Based on these observations, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 3, 6 (high valuations)
- **Agent 1:** Item 2 (unique high valuation)
- **Agent 2:** Item 4 (unique high valuation)
- **Agent 3:** Item 7 (decent valuation)
- **Agent 4:** Item 5 (high valuation)
- **Agent 5:** Items 0, 1 (remaining items with balanced value)

This allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received items they value highly, reducing envy.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```
