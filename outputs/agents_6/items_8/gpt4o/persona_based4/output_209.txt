Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  49  21  32  40  36   5  39
1   7  87  81  63  75  88  85   2
2  63   8  45  93  37  82  28  70
3  17  30  21  30   4  46   3  98
4  61   3  79  57   1  18  37  45
5  25  46  61   2  73  87  62  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. However, since the number of items is less than the number of agents, achieving exact envy-freeness might not be possible. Instead, I'll focus on distributing the total value fairly according to the agents' valuations.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 23 + 49 + 21 + 32 + 40 + 36 + 5 + 39 = 245
- Agent 1: 7 + 87 + 81 + 63 + 75 + 88 + 85 + 2 = 488
- Agent 2: 63 + 8 + 45 + 93 + 37 + 82 + 28 + 70 = 426
- Agent 3: 17 + 30 + 21 + 30 + 4 + 46 + 3 + 98 = 249
- Agent 4: 61 + 3 + 79 + 57 + 1 + 18 + 37 + 45 = 301
- Agent 5: 25 + 46 + 61 + 2 + 73 + 87 + 62 + 54 = 410

Next, I will consider a rough approach to distribute items by selecting the highest valued items for each agent one by one until all items are allocated. This method won't guarantee envy-freeness but will attempt a fair distribution of high-value items based on each agent's preferences:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 5 (88), item 4 (75), and item 6 (85).
2. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (93) and item 5 (82).
3. Agent 3 highly values item 7 (98).
4. Agent 4 highly values item 2 (79).
5. Agent 5 highly values item 5 (87) and item 4 (73).
6. Agent 0 highly values item 1 (49).

Let's allocate these high-value items first:

- Agent 1: item 5
- Agent 2: item 3
- Agent 3: item 7
- Agent 4: item 2
- Agent 5: item 4
- Agent 0: item 1

Now we have allocated 6 items and need to allocate 2 more. We will look at the next highest values for the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 0, 6
- Agent 1 values 6 highly (85), allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 has item 0 as the next highest (23), allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

This results in:

- Agent 0: items 1, 0
- Agent 1: items 5, 6
- Agent 2: item 3
- Agent 3: item 7
- Agent 4: item 2
- Agent 5: item 4

Finally, the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```
