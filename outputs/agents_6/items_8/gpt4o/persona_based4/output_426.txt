Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  81  58  27  13  97   1  58
1  95  91  99  43  88  85  89  50
2  43  95  55  38  89   7   5  33
3  53  37  78  68  53  68  37  44
4  80  58  29  64  19   1  74  96
5  90  20  28  88  92  50  98  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives a fair share, which ideally means minimizing envy (no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own).

One common method is the "Envy-Free" allocation, where each agent gets at least as much value for its allocation as it perceives any other agent receiving for theirs. However, with integer allocations and a limited number of items, perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable. In such cases, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Start by considering high-value items for each agent to maximize individual satisfaction.
2. Try to balance the total value for each agent as evenly as possible.

After analyzing the given valuations, here is one fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (97), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (99), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (95), so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (68), so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the most (96), so allocate item 7 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 6 the most (98), so allocate item 6 to Agent 5.
- Remaining items (0 and 4) need to be allocated to balance overall fairness.
  - Allocate item 0 to Agent 4 (next highest value for Agent 4).
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 5 (next highest value for Agent 5).

This allocation aims to distribute the items while considering each agent's highest preferences and balancing overall total values:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7, 0],
    "5": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, while also distributing the total value as fairly as possible given the constraints of integer allocations.
