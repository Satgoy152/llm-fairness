Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  73  90  41   8  54  97  38
1  13  61  24   8  40  47  69  95
2  35  73  38  11  60  61  49  15
3  20  99  12  66  76  61   4  32
4  66  58  62  53  64   1  18  94
5  91  19  24  82  79  31  96  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible. A common approach in fair division is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints and valuations, let's proceed with an allocation strategy.

First, let's determine a fair allocation by considering each agent's highest-valued items in a manner that attempts to equalize total value among agents. We'll try to maximize each agent's utility while keeping allocations balanced.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Agent 0**: Highest-valued item is 6 (value 97).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest-valued item is 7 (value 95).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest-valued item is 5 (value 61).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest-valued item is 1 (value 99).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 already (next highest: item 0, value 66).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest-valued item is 0 (value 91).

Now, we check remaining items and values for each agent:

- **Remaining items**: 2, 3, 4
- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (value 90).
- **Agent 1**: Already allocated item 7.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (value 11).
- **Agent 3**: Already allocated item 1.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4 (value 64).
- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 0 already.

This allocation provides a distribution close to envy-freeness based on initial preferences and values.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items that maximize their utility based on the given valuations while balancing the total allocation.
