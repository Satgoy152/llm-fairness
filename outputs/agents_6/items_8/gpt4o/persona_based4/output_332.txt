Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  84  65  25  39  50  60  54
1  45  63  26   7  22  87   6   5
2  20   5  57   0  63   5  48  68
3  79  92  11  69  44  90  38  27
4   8  46  48  51  98  25  96  46
5  20  63  14  10  27  30  97  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, given the constraints of the problem. With six agents and eight items, some agents will get more items than others, but we can try to balance the allocations based on the values agents assign to the items.

Let's analyze the values and attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most, then item 0. Let's allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the most. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 7 the most. Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most, but it is already taken by Agent 0. Their next preference is item 5, which is taken by Agent 1. The next high-value item is 0, which is taken by Agent 0. Their next preference is item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the most. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5** values item 6 the most. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated six items: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The remaining item is 2. We need to allocate this item as well:

- **Agent 2** values item 2 next after item 7. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

Now each item is allocated, and we can present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
