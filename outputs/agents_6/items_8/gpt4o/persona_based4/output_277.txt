Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  18  30  22   5  60  42  86
1  22  39   6  67  31  90  26  28
2  78  91  48  66  12  31  87  35
3  26  75  24  26  89  30  73  21
4  16  84   0  79  30   5  98  93
5  71  93  54  38  30  51  16  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints that each agent should receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, we can proceed with a heuristic approach to ensure fairness.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Sort items by their highest value to any agent to ensure they are placed efficiently.
3. Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while minimizing envy.

First, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 326
- Agent 1: 309
- Agent 2: 448
- Agent 3: 364
- Agent 4: 405
- Agent 5: 400

Using these total values, we can attempt to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations:

- Agent 0: [7] (highest value of 86 for item 7)
- Agent 1: [5] (highest value of 90 for item 5)
- Agent 2: [1, 2] (highest values of 91 and 48 for items 1 and 2)
- Agent 3: [4, 6] (highest values of 89 and 73 for items 4 and 6)
- Agent 4: [3] (highest value of 79 for item 3)
- Agent 5: [0] (highest value of 71 for item 0)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
