Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  42  82  32   1  72  24   8
1  66  97  99  35  52  42  78  88
2  54  74  49  10  58  20  10  77
3  66  52  69  45  12   9  44  12
4   8  97  10  99  28  57   7  97
5  68  63  59  95  36  42  39  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution concept. The MNW solution maximizes the product of the utilities of the agents, offering a balance between total fairness and efficiency. Given the valuations in the table, we will try to allocate the items to achieve this balance.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items:

1. Agent 0 has high interest in item 2.
2. Agent 1 has high interest in items 1, 2, and 7.
3. Agent 2 has high interest in items 1 and 7.
4. Agent 3 has high interest in item 0.
5. Agent 4 has high interest in items 3, 1, and 7.
6. Agent 5 has high interest in items 3 and 0.

We will attempt to allocate items to maximize fairness while considering the agents' preferences:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since they value it highly.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, who values it the most.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 as a compromise, given their relatively high interest.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3, who values it and doesn't have any other high-value items.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4, who has the highest value for it.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5, given their moderate value and to keep distribution balanced.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as they have a significant value for it and can balance their allocation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as they have a moderate interest and to balance the allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the preferences and ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
