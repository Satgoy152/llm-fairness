Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9   2  74  80  34  54  21  57
1  51  67  58  33  30  32  37  14
2  53  93  98  62  83  95  86  74
3  24   2  12   2  19  37  55  80
4  95  74  57  32  48  49  83  16
5  69   3  77  89   5  93  91  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the "Maximum Nash Welfare" approach, which seeks to maximize the product of the utilities derived by each agent from their allocated items. This can often lead to allocations that are fair and minimize envy.

Let's compute an allocation considering the given valuations:

1. **Calculate the utility of each allocation:** For each agent, we assign the items that provide them with the most utility, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents may receive more than one item.

2. **Identify the best items for each agent:** 
    - Agent 0 values items 3 and 2 highly.
    - Agent 1 values items 1 and 2 highly.
    - Agent 2 values items 2 and 5 highly.
    - Agent 3 values item 7 highly.
    - Agent 4 values item 0 highly.
    - Agent 5 values item 3 highly.

3. **Allocate items to minimize envy:**
   - Assign items such that the overall satisfaction (product of utilities) is maximized, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [4, 6]

This allocation gives each agent items they value highly, aiming to reduce envy and maximize each agent's satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, thus aiming for a fair division based on the given valuations.
