Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  55  53   9   9   3  13  36
1  36  13  50  74  42  62  59  41
2  24  13  93  70  96  68  74  75
3  92   1  68  48  94   0   1  89
4  96  61  91  97  55  76  49  93
5  33  84  60  96  59  47  40  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations in the matrix, and the fact there are 8 items and 6 agents, it is practical to distribute one or two items per agent to reach a fair allocation. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 highly, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 highly, but it's already allocated. The next best item is item 7, so allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 highly, but it's already allocated. The next best items are 0 and 7, but both are allocated. Item 4 is also allocated; thus, allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 1 highly, so allocate item 1 to Agent 5.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (5 and 6):

- **Agent 2** has only one item and values item 5 highly (second highest after 4), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 4** values item 6 higher than unallocated items and has only one item, so allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation is designed to ensure each agent receives items they highly value while maintaining fairness and minimizing envy among the agents.
