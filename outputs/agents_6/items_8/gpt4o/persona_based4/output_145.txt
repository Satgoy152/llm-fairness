Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  70   6  28  13  45  62  59
1  10  88   5  90  98  20  77  71
2  71  30  21  72  43  81  72  20
3  76  75  11  15  70  78   6  96
4  72  44  37  45  31  94  60  32
5  11  97   3  85  25  34  53  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agentâ€™s valuation of each item. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair, meaning no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: First, identify the highest-valued items from each agent's perspective, as these items are likely to be the most contested.

2. **Assign High-Value Items**: Try to assign these high-value items to the respective agents if feasible, ensuring that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation.

3. **Balance the Allocations**: After allocating the most valued items, distribute the remaining items to balance the total value perceived by each agent.

4. **Iterate and Adjust**: Check for any possible envy and adjust the allocations accordingly to minimize it.

Given the valuations, here is a possible allocation that attempts to be envy-free:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (70).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (98).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (81).
- Agent 3 highly values item 7 (96).
- Agent 4 highly values item 5 (94), but since it is already allocated, we allocate another high-value item for balance.
- Agent 5 highly values item 1 (97), but since it is already allocated, we allocate another high-value item for balance.

Now, we try to balance the allocations:

- Agent 0 can get item 6 as well.
- Agent 1 can get item 3.
- Agent 2 can get item 2.
- Agent 3 can get item 0.
- Agent 4 can get item 7.
- Agent 5 can get item 4.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [7, 0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. It attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest valuations and balancing the overall allocation.
