Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  28  34  16  31  81  29  63
1   4  27   1  52  55  13  22   6
2  23  68  53  34  97  95  16  78
3  67  78   5  19  48  73  78  12
4  48  87  45  98  13  34  41  54
5  38  53   8  60  59  78  87  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a fair manner, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to minimize envy. This means trying to distribute the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share according to their own valuations.

Let's start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate them in a way that each agent gets a satisfying share.

1. **Identify agent preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (81).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (55).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (97).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (78).
   - Agent 4 values item 3 the most (98).
   - Agent 5 values item 7 the most (93).

2. **Highest value allocations:**
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it significantly more than Agent 1).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 5.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Items remaining: 0, 2, 6.
   - Agent 1 has no item yet, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values item 2 the least, but it's the remaining item).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 as it's their next highest preference.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 5 as they also value it highly.

4. **Final allocations:**
   - Agent 0: [5]
   - Agent 1: [2]
   - Agent 2: [0, 4]
   - Agent 3: [1]
   - Agent 4: [3]
   - Agent 5: [6, 7]

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6, 7]
}
```
