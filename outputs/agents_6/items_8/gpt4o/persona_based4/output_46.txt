Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  53  38  72  12  50  43  92
1  38  35  50  69  71  20   4  17
2  81  65  53  82  92  52  44  44
3  75  42  36  59  15  27  11  66
4  59  27  97  28   1  26  25  27
5  63  29  74  39  15  82   0  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, given their valuations. With 6 agents and 8 items, not every agent will receive an item, but we will try to distribute the items in such a way that the allocations are as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 7 (value 92) and item 3 (value 72).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 4 (value 71) and item 2 (value 50).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 4 (value 92) and item 3 (value 82).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 (value 75) and item 7 (value 66).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 2 (value 97) and item 0 (value 59).
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 5 (value 82) and item 2 (value 74).

After considering these preferences:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2 and not overlapping with Agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1 after Agent 2 takes item 4).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (next highest value for Agent 3; item 7 is already taken).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (next highest value for Agent 5 after item 5).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5 as well (highest value for Agent 5).

Now we have used 6 items and need to allocate 2 more:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (since it's not among the highest preferences of other agents).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (as it is the only remaining item and Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for it).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
This allocation attempts to balance the preferences of the agents while ensuring all items are allocated.
