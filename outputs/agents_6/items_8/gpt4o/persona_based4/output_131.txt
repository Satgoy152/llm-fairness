Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  32   8  82  98  80   3  77
1  13  59  67  50  90  79  51  70
2  83   8  19  44  63  73  67  52
3  15  80  70  80  24  78  86  32
4  89  57  88  11  20  30  90  34
5  77  24  34  41  54  25  56   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to achieve envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them so that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation in comparison to others. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in practice, our goal will be to minimize envy as much as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and no agent receives more than two items, considering we have 6 agents and 8 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 4 (98), so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly (59) and it is not highly valued by others, so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a strong preference for item 0 (83), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly (80), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 2 (88), so allocate item 2 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 5 highly (25, though not the highest among others, it's one of the better available), so allocate item 5 to agent 5.
7. Now, let's allocate the last two items (6 and 7) based on remaining preferences.
   - **Agent 3** values item 6 (86) significantly, so allocate item 6 to agent 3.
   - **Agent 1** values item 7 (70) highly, so allocate item 7 to agent 1.

Here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent an item they highly value relative to their preferences and ensuring all items are allocated.
