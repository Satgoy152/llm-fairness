Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  51  79  62  43   4  73  91
1  26  96  67  54  90  68  47  23
2  14  75  84  54  91  77  50  46
3  13  49  70  83  57  14  30  79
4  91  53  40  71  53  33  99  35
5  69  39  19  23  12  83  85  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "maximum Nash welfare" approach. This method aims to maximize the product of the agents' utilities, which tends to yield allocations that are both efficient and fair.

Here's how we can proceed to find an allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** First, look for items that have significantly higher valuations for certain agents compared to others. Allocate these items to the agents who value them the most to ensure maximum satisfaction.

2. **Balance Allocations:** Ensure that each agent gets at least one item (if possible), and try to balance the overall value of items each agent receives to maintain fairness.

3. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness:** After the initial allocation, check for any potential envy situations and make small adjustments if necessary to reduce envy.

Let's implement this approach:

### Initial Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Item 7 (91)
- **Agent 1:** Item 1 (96)
- **Agent 2:** Item 4 (91)
- **Agent 3:** Item 3 (83)
- **Agent 4:** Item 6 (99)
- **Agent 5:** Item 5 (83)

### Remaining Items (0, 2):
- **Item 0:** Highest value for Agent 4 (91)
- **Item 2:** Highest value for Agent 0 (79)

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items 7, 2
- **Agent 1:** Item 1
- **Agent 2:** Item 4
- **Agent 3:** Item 3
- **Agent 4:** Items 6, 0
- **Agent 5:** Item 5

This allocation considers the highest valuations and distributes the items to minimize envy, aiming for a fair distribution.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 0],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated among the 6 agents.
