Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52   3  84  83   5  91  69   0
1   3   8  12  16  99  63  50  85
2  67  69   7  85  65   5  19  68
3  86  12  91  80  82  65  24  62
4  82  40  85  45  31  43  75   2
5   5  76  19  78  29  66  40  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use a method like the "round-robin" allocation or "maximum marginal value" approach, among others. Here, I'll attempt to distribute items by considering an approximate notion of envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent receives items they highly value whenever possible.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 387
- Agent 1: 336
- Agent 2: 385
- Agent 3: 502
- Agent 4: 403
- Agent 5: 358

To begin the allocation, I will attempt to assign items so that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and then continue to distribute the remaining items to balance the perceived value across the agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 5 (value 91)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (value 99)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (value 85)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value 91)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 0 (value 82)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 1 (value 76)

Now, distribute the remaining two items (6 and 7) to balance values:

7. **Agent 0**: Item 6 (value 69)
8. **Agent 1**: Item 7 (value 85)

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their top-valued items. Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, I've attempted to balance the total perceived value each agent receives while ensuring that each item is allocated exactly once.
