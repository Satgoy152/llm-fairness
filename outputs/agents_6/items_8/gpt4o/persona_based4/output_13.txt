Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  30  42  37  11  16  33  76
1  10  98  62  27  19  71  71  60
2  83  94  54  85   0  34   0  93
3  54  30  40  83  83  71  85  30
4  75  68  14  26  99  73  60  35
5  46  57  47  70  90  26  99  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should ideally prefer their own allocation over others'. One common approach is to use the maximin share (MMS) fairness criterion, which aims to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as they would their worst possible bundle if they were dividing the items themselves.

For simplicity in this problem, I'll focus on a heuristic allocation that attempts to balance allocations while considering each agent's preferences.

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items.
2. Try to allocate items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on these valuations.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 and 7 highly, so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly, so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 and 7 highly, so assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 and 6 highly, so assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly, so assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 2 and 4 highly, so assign item 2 to Agent 5.

After initial allocations, some items remain unallocated, we need to consider envy-freeness and fairness:

- Item 3 is unallocated, and Agent 2 values it highly, assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Item 5 is unallocated, assign it to Agent 3, who values it next highest after 6.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the value each agent receives while considering their preferences for different items.
