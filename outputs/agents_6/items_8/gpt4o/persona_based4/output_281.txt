Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93   7  27  32  63  67  49  45
1  46  67  41  76  28  64  38  40
2  43  33  57  34  32  40   2  50
3  14  10  72  94  35  92  69  25
4   2  38  90  91  96  50  33  67
5  55  85  14  70  50   6  42  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to minimize envy, we can use an approach inspired by the Envy-Free Matching principle. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, the allocation won't be perfectly envy-free, but we can try to make it as fair as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Identify any standout preferences where an agent values an item significantly more than others, and prioritize those allocations to minimize potential envy.

2. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Sum up each agent's valuations to identify if any agents have significantly lower total valuations, which might suggest giving them slightly better allocations.

3. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by allocating items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

4. **Adjust for Fairness**: Balance the allocations by ensuring no agent is too disadvantaged compared to others, trying to keep the distribution of total valuations as even as possible across agents.

Here is an allocation based on these principles:

```json
{
    "0": [0],       // Agent 0 highly values item 0
    "1": [3, 6],    // Agent 1 highly values items 3 and 6
    "2": [2],       // Agent 2 highly values item 2
    "3": [5],       // Agent 3 highly values item 5
    "4": [4],       // Agent 4 highly values item 4
    "5": [1, 7]     // Agent 5 highly values items 1 and 7
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as best as possible while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated.
