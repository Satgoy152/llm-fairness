Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  94  90  81  13  99  74  75
1  65  76  57  50  50  34  32  10
2  20  16  73  15  71  20  33  12
3  46  97  47  55  85  66  38  60
4  49  26  95  68  77  76  25   1
5  79  55  27  59  64  22  56  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items to the 6 agents in a way that considers the fairness and envy-freeness of the distribution. One common method for achieving this is to assign items based on maximizing the sum of the agents' valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, we can start by finding an allocation where the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's try to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness.

We'll begin by examining the valuations for each item and try to allocate items in a manner that maximizes each agent's total value while maintaining fairness.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Items 4
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7
- Agent 4: Items 6
- Agent 5: No items

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent getting a fair share based on their valuations.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that balances the agents' valuations and ensures fairness.
