Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  55  38  71  49  78  16  18
1  67  40  37  19  31   8  47   8
2  34  15  48   5  25  65  69  80
3  76  79  84  47  85  15  11  39
4  30  50  73  22  60  65  52  76
5  51  19  93  31  21  80  83  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for a division that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. Given the valuations matrix, we'll try to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 39 + 55 + 38 + 71 + 49 + 78 + 16 + 18 = 364
- Agent 1: 67 + 40 + 37 + 19 + 31 + 8 + 47 + 8 = 257
- Agent 2: 34 + 15 + 48 + 5 + 25 + 65 + 69 + 80 = 341
- Agent 3: 76 + 79 + 84 + 47 + 85 + 15 + 11 + 39 = 436
- Agent 4: 30 + 50 + 73 + 22 + 60 + 65 + 52 + 76 = 428
- Agent 5: 51 + 19 + 93 + 31 + 21 + 80 + 83 + 93 = 471

Next, we will allocate items based on maximizing the total value for each agent while maintaining balance among the agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 4 (Value: 55 + 49 = 104)
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 6 (Value: 67 + 47 = 114)
- Agent 2 receives items: 5, 7 (Value: 65 + 80 = 145)
- Agent 3 receives items: 3 (Value: 47)
- Agent 4 receives items: 2 (Value: 73)
- Agent 5 receives items: (Value: 0)

This allocation attempts to distribute high valuation items evenly among agents to ensure a fair share of total value. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

This solution ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
