Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  50  28  16   9  95  12  36
1  36  77  47   1  28  28  45  22
2  64  76  78  10  71  52  18  65
3   1  68  70  83  35  89  28   5
4  49  25  73  14  95  51  80   3
5  72  36  30  48  15   6  73  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a fair manner, we can aim for an envy-free division, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Valuation Matrix**: Each agent has different valuations for the items. We need to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

2. **Initial Consideration**: Since there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We must ensure that the distribution minimizes envy.

3. **Greedy Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, avoiding conflicts.
   - If two agents value the same item the most, compare their second most valued items and assign accordingly, ensuring no item is double-assigned.
   - Repeat this process until all items are assigned.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Distribute the remaining items to agents who have fewer items until all items are allocated.

Following these steps, we can derive the allocation of items to agents:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent having a share they value, minimizing potential envy among them.
