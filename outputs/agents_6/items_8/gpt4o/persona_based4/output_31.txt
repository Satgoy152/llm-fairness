Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  42   7  44  37  63   2  25
1  99  24  54  23   3  30  24  39
2  80  32  76  80  69  26  19  26
3  72  11  27  17  47  50  68  45
4  71  58  40  10  77  23  39  33
5  15   3  76  68  54  28  59  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy and ensures every agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a simplified version of the envy-free allocation method. In this scenario, one way to approach the allocation is by using the "maximum marginal utility" principle, where each item is given to the agent who values it the most. However, since each agent must get at least one item and only a total of 8 items are available, some compromise may be necessary.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure every agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

The valuations are as follows:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (99)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (42)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 5 (76)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 2 (80)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 4 (77)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (63)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 3 (68)
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 3 (45)

Following this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 6, 7
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
