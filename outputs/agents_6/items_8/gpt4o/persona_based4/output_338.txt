Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  16   0  35  20  71  13  23
1  52  71  37  37  73  91  29   5
2  22  28  97  71  68  63  48  34
3  66  75  76  71  55   5   3  39
4  17  78  76  98  47  92  89  79
5  23  65  45   1  68  60  28  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible, we can use a simple algorithm that iteratively assigns the most valued remaining item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:**  
   - Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 66.
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 75.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 97.
   - Item 3: Agent 4 values it at 98.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 73.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 91.
   - Item 6: Agent 4 values it at 89.
   - Item 7: Agent 4 values it at 79.

2. **Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:**

   - **Agent 2:** Allocate Item 2 (value 97) to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 4:** Allocate Item 3 (value 98) to Agent 4.
   - **Agent 1:** Allocate Item 5 (value 91) to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 3:** Allocate Item 1 (value 75) to Agent 3.
   - **Agent 0:** Allocate Item 0 (value 59) to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 4:** Allocate Item 6 (value 89) to Agent 4.
   - **Agent 4:** Allocate Item 7 (value 79) to Agent 4.
   - **Agent 1:** Allocate Item 4 (value 73) to Agent 1.

3. **Ensure each agent is included in the allocation JSON, even those receiving no items:**

The allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 6, 7],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize fairness by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that items are distributed across agents.
