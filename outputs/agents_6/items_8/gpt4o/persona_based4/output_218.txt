Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  23  76  97  36  92  74  14
1  52  88  86  87  87  40  46  66
2  68  76  96  52  65  29  18  52
3  46  87  91  22  57  43  54  96
4  77  81  96  30  49  79   8  92
5  10  77  98  30  19  82  40  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to ensure envy-freeness and fairness, such as the maximin share approach or the envy-free up to one item (EF1) criterion. Given the valuations and the need to allocate all items, let's aim for an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate total valuations for each agent**: Calculate how the sum of valuations of all items is distributed among the agents.
2. **Allocate items greedily**: Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives as close as possible to an equal share of the total value.

Let's break down the allocation:

- Agent 0's highest valued items: 3 (97), 5 (92), 2 (76)
- Agent 1's highest valued items: 2 (86), 3 (87), 1 (88)
- Agent 2's highest valued items: 2 (96), 0 (68), 1 (76)
- Agent 3's highest valued items: 7 (96), 2 (91), 1 (87)
- Agent 4's highest valued items: 2 (96), 7 (92), 5 (79)
- Agent 5's highest valued items: 2 (98), 5 (82), 1 (77)

We need to allocate 8 items in total. Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 5] - High value on items 3 and 5
- **Agent 1**: [1] - Highest valuation for item 1
- **Agent 2**: [0] - Valuation maximized by item 0
- **Agent 3**: [7] - Highest valuation for item 7
- **Agent 4**: [4, 6] - Balanced allocation with items 4 and 6
- **Agent 5**: [2] - Highest valuation for item 2

This allocation aims to balance the total values while providing each agent with certain high-valued items.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [2]
}
```
