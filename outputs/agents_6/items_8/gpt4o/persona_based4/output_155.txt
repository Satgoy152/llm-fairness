Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  45  13  74  12  18  27  47
1  32  71  33  57  25  41  47  27
2  64  26  75  61  68   9  17  67
3  56  95  47  95  77  14  78  71
4  76  78  58  65  69  20  89  90
5  12  19  80  10  52  26  43  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we aim to minimize envy and try to ensure each agent feels they receive a fair share. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:** This helps us understand the overall preferences of each agent.

2. **Assign items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:** Start by assigning items to agents who value them the most. This helps in minimizing potential envy.

3. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible:** This may not always be feasible due to the number of items and agents, but we will try to distribute items fairly.

4. **Iterate and adjust:** Check if any agent feels particularly envious and try to adjust allocations to minimize this.

Using this approach, here's how the allocation can be structured:

- **Agent 0** values item 3 the most with a value of 74.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the most with a value of 71.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 the most with a value of 75.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 the most with a value of 95. However, since agent 1 also values item 1 highly, we assign item 7 to agent 3, as it is still a high value for them.
- **Agent 4** values item 7 the most with a value of 90. Since item 7 is allocated to agent 3, we assign item 4 to agent 4 as it is the next highest value.
- **Agent 5** values item 7 the most, but since it's already taken, we assign item 2 to them as a compromise.

Given the constraints and the need for fair allocation, here's a feasible distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "5": [6],
    "2": [0]
}
```

Note: The allocation ensures each item is distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, to the extent possible, based on their highest valuations.
