Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  33  14  86  79  96  88  31
1  99  36  63  66  99  93  16  23
2  31   3  11  54  68  62  13  41
3  53  10  52  74  83  34  18  52
4  68  44  24  13  87  96  17  47
5  27  92  67  49   6  18  86  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations matrix, our goal is to allocate items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible. One approach to achieving a fair division is to use an algorithm like the envy-free method or the adjusted winner procedure. However, for simplicity and given the discrete nature of the items and agents, a heuristic approach can be applied.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent can get at least one item.

2. **Check for Envy:** Adjust allocations to reduce envy, considering overall valuations and ensuring each agent gets their fair share.

3. **Final Adjustments:** Ensure all items are allocated and that no agent receives more than necessary if possible.

After carefully examining the valuations and performing the allocation, here is the fair division:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and attempts to minimize envy. Each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
