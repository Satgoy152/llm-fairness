Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  80  76  80  67  53  68  48
1  32  74  77  93  90  37  98  30
2  97  45  91  76  62   6  33  78
3  28  50  62  96  58  36  93  19
4  74   9   1  10  55  94   4  44
5  96  93  31  75  35  99  91  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free distribution. This implies that each agent should be at least as happy with their allocation as they would be with anyone else's.

Given the agents' valuations for the items, we can use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" to ensure fairness, taking into account each agent's preference order. However, since the problem is computationally complex, achieving perfect envy-freeness might be challenging, but we can strive for a balanced distribution.

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. Rank each agent's preference for items based on their valuations.
2. Apply a round-robin approach to assign items, going by the highest preference available for each agent in turn.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 80) and item 2 (value 76).
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 93) and item 4 (value 90).
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 97).
- Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 93).
- Agent 4 gets item 5 (value 94).
- Agent 5 gets item 7 (value 69).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total satisfaction based on their highest-valued items, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than two.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all eight items are distributed among them.
