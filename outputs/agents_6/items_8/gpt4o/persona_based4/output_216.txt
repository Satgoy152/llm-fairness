Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  79  54  41  13  24  90  29
1  91  93  41  75  18   9  36  16
2  83  35  23  53  17   4   0  79
3  62  42  40  30  34  15  49  38
4  77  92  48  27  16  74   2  59
5   5  35  96  42  26  81  63  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to take into account each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

One approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin allocation based on each agent's highest valued remaining item. We'll proceed with this method and analyze the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 6 (value = 90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 1 (value = 93).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 0 (value = 83).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 0 (value = 62, but already taken, next highest is item 6).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 1 (value = 92, but already taken, next highest is item 5).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is item 2 (value = 96).

After this initial round, we have:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [2]

Now, continue the allocation for the remaining items [3, 4, 7]:

7. **Agent 3**: Highest remaining value is item 3 (value = 30).

8. **Agent 4**: Next highest remaining value is item 7 (value = 59).

9. **Agent 5**: Next highest remaining value is item 4 (value = 26).

Finally, we have the following allocation:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5, 7]
- Agent 5: [2, 4]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
