Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  77  99  76  68  73  22  98
1  68  58  10  99  36   9  56  76
2  46  18  11  50   1  43   8  55
3  42  27  91  50  43  21   9  56
4  38  48  17  10  64  42  19  24
5   3  91  53  47  24  73  53  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can attempt to make allocations that minimize envy and distribute the items as evenly as possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 7, which are among the highest valuations in the table.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 3.
3. Agent 2 has relatively low valuations compared to others, but item 5 seems reasonable.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 2, but since it's taken by Agent 0, we can assign item 7.
5. Agent 4 does not have any standout high valuations, but item 4 is relatively high.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 highly.

Given these considerations, here is one potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [1]

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 6). These can be distributed to balance the number of items per agent:

- Agent 0: [2, 0]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [1, 6]

This allocation results in each agent getting at least one item, and it attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
