Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  23  38  34  18  57  76  14
1  15   9  61  66  57  63  45  84
2  87  59  90  29   1  43  26  29
3   8  33  33  25  79  65  36  29
4  37  98  65   1  93  70  64  25
5  67  31  56  71  99  16  99  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will consider the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Given the valuations provided, a fair division should ensure that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their own utility based on their valuations.

Let's follow these steps to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **List the Items and Agents**: We have 8 items and 6 agents.
2. **Consider Valuations**: Each agent has different valuations for each item, and we want to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.
3. **Allocate Items**: We aim to distribute all 8 items among the agents such that no agent feels envious of another, or their envy is minimized.

To achieve this, we can use a heuristic approach by assigning items to agents based on descending order of utility until all items are assigned:

- First, identify which agent values each item the most.
- Assign that item to the respective agent.
- Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

### Item Assignments

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by agent 0 (87).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by agent 4 (98).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by agent 2 (90).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by agent 1 (66).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by agent 5 (99).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by agent 1 (63).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is by agent 5 (99).
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is by agent 1 (84).

### Allocation Plan

Let's distribute the items based on the above highest valuations, ensuring that all items are distributed, and agents get at least one item.

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3, 5, 7]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [4, 6]

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and agents receive items in a way that maximizes their preferences.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 5, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation utilizes all 8 items and strives to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their individual valuations.
