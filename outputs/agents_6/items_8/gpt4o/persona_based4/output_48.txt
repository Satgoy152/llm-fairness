Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  49  24  41   9  10   0  91
1  88  70  42  10   9  72  38  83
2  58  76  57  12  82  67   8  62
3  14  39  42  86  38  61  90  71
4  76  46  34   8   0  47  72  73
5  35  79  65  73  49  98  14  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a manner that is as fair as possible, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations can be challenging, especially with fewer items than agents. 

Given the valuations, let's attempt to distribute the items in a way that considers each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0** prefers item 7 (91).
2. **Agent 1** prefers item 0 (88).
3. **Agent 2** prefers item 4 (82).
4. **Agent 3** prefers item 6 (90).
5. **Agent 4** prefers item 0 (76), but item 0 is already allocated, so we should consider the next preferences.
6. **Agent 5** prefers item 5 (98).

Now, let's allocate each agent their most preferred available item and adjust if needed:

- **Agent 0** gets item 7.
- **Agent 1** gets item 0.
- **Agent 2** gets item 4.
- **Agent 3** gets item 6.
- **Agent 5** gets item 5.

This leaves items 1, 2, and 3 unallocated. We will allocate these to the agents based on their second-highest preferences:

- **Agent 4** has a preference for item 7, but it's taken. Their next best is item 3 (8), which is available.
- **Agent 5** has a preference for item 5, but it's taken. Their next best is item 3 (73), which is available. However, since item 3 is now allocated to agent 4, we will consider item 1 (79) for Agent 5.
- **Agent 0** has an unallocated second preference for item 1 (49).

Letâ€™s finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items 7 and 2.
- **Agent 1** gets item 0.
- **Agent 2** gets item 4.
- **Agent 3** gets item 6.
- **Agent 4** gets item 3.
- **Agent 5** gets items 5 and 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5, 1]
}
```
