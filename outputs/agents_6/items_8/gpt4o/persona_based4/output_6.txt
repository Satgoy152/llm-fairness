Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  69  61  74   8   7  83  89
1  38  83  17  43  77  21  93  36
2  40  25  24  53  60  78  29  95
3  25  89  18  50   1  52  93  35
4  31  14   2  69  46  33  69  61
5  62  89   7  22  87  22   4  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can apply a common method in fair division problems: the Maximum Envy-Free Allocation (MEFA). The goal is to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their individual valuations.

To simplify, we can aim to make the allocation almost envy-free by trying to balance the total value each agent receives according to their valuations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Identify the total value each agent assigns to all items**:
   - Agent 0: 17 + 69 + 61 + 74 + 8 + 7 + 83 + 89 = 408
   - Agent 1: 38 + 83 + 17 + 43 + 77 + 21 + 93 + 36 = 408
   - Agent 2: 40 + 25 + 24 + 53 + 60 + 78 + 29 + 95 = 404
   - Agent 3: 25 + 89 + 18 + 50 + 1 + 52 + 93 + 35 = 363
   - Agent 4: 31 + 14 + 2 + 69 + 46 + 33 + 69 + 61 = 325
   - Agent 5: 62 + 89 + 7 + 22 + 87 + 22 + 4 + 93 = 386

2. **Allocate items to balance the total value**:
   - Assign items to agents in a way that each agent receives a similar proportion of their total valuation.

3. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item**:
   - Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, at least two agents will get an additional item to ensure all items are distributed.

Based on these considerations, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3, 7]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [2]

This allocation tries to balance the value each agent receives according to their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated fairly.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
