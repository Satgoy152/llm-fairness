Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  86  72  64  53  61  96  92
1  25  88  96  95  35  50  16  76
2  57  10  36  70  71  11  74  99
3  10  94  66  38   5  51  43  32
4  57  67  19  85  36  64  89  13
5  52  61  28   1  13   7   0  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they have received the best possible set of items given their preferences. However, note that achieving perfect envy-freeness can be complex, especially when the number of items doesn't evenly divide among the agents. Here, we aim for a fair distribution of items by considering each agent’s preferences as represented by their valuations.

A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where in each step, we assign the most valuable remaining item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't received an item yet. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (value 96), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 6 the most (value 96), so assign item 6 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 the most (value 99), so assign item 7 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most (value 94), so assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 the most, but it’s already taken, so they value item 3 next (value 85), so assign item 3 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 7 the most, but it’s already taken, so they value item 0 next (value 52), so assign item 0 to agent 5.
7. Now, all agents have received an item. Let's distribute the remaining items 4 and 5.
8. **Agent 0** has item 6, which is valued at 96. For the remaining items, Agent 0 values item 5 next (value 61), so assign item 5 to agent 0.
9. **Agent 2** has item 7, which is valued at 99. For the remaining items, Agent 2 values item 4 next (value 71), so assign item 4 to agent 2.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
