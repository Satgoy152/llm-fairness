Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  98   2  34  83   3  42   7
1  43  27  73   8  57  90  45  83
2  93  44  75  26   2  98  30   4
3  88  72  76  84  39   5  59  67
4  96  23  56  43  68  31  26  61
5  67  54  89  12  54  44   9  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we must consider the concept of envy-freeness where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix for the agents and items, I will use a systematic approach to ensure each agent receives a fair allocation according to their preferences.

Let's calculate a fair allocation:

1. **Initialization**: Start by arranging the items so that each agent gets at least one item they value highly.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation.

3. **Balancing**: Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives a fair share relative to the total value of items.

Let's compute this step by step:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation
- Assign each agent one of their most valued items to ensure everyone gets something they value.

### Step 2: Greedy Allocation
- Allocate remaining items to agents based on their next highest valuations while ensuring envy-freeness.

### Step 3: Balancing
- If any agent has more items, check if redistributing an item would improve envy-freeness.

Here is a potential allocation of items using the above methodology:

- Agent 0 receives items they value highly but not the highest valued by others.
- Agent 1 receives items based on their second highest preferences.
- Continue this for each agent ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation.

### Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items between agents while ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on their individual valuations. It should be noted that this is a complex problem and multiple fair allocations may exist.
