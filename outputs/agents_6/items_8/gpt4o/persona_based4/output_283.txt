Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  38  52  24  89  16  32   4
1  61  90  92  65  17  90  97   2
2  15  47  39  63  77  12  24  48
3  21   5  18  51  38  36  45  59
4  34  39  62   1   8  46  64  70
5  39   1  20  47  36  81  24   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method such as the Adjusted Winner or other fair division algorithms. However, given the constraints, we'll manually consider a reasonable division.

The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels envy, meaning every agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as anyone else's based on their personal valuations. This is a challenging task and might not always be perfectly achievable, but we'll aim to get as close as possible.

Here's one way to allocate these items:

- Agent 0 has high valuation for items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 highly values items 1, 2, and 5.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most, but that is already taken by agent 0. Their next best option is item 3.
- Agent 3's highest value is for item 7.
- Agent 4 could take item 6, which is of moderate value to them.
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 5, but it's already taken. Their next best option is item 5, which they can't take either. They might be left with the least desired item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [5]

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' preferences and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```
