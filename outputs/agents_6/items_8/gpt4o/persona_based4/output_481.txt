Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  96  67  55   7  63  71  54
1  19  83  36   8  32  80  81  35
2  74  88  38  67  57  78  23  17
3  22  76  68  36  92  92  89  78
4  93  42  21  50  21  97  62  87
5  22  77  20  84  29  27  69  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim for a distribution that reduces envy and maximizes each agent's satisfaction. We will use a simple heuristic approach to achieve this.

1. **Identify Agents' Preferences:** We start by examining the value each agent assigns to items and attempt to allocate items to maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 most (96).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 most (81).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 most (88), but since it's taken, item 5 (78) suits them next.
   - Agent 3 values item 4 and 5 equally (92), but since 5 is taken, item 4 is allocated.
   - Agent 4 values item 0 most (93).
   - Agent 5 values item 3 most (84).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:** We then allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Now, we'll proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Item 1 (96)
- **Agent 1:** Item 6 (81)
- **Agent 2:** Item 5 (78)
- **Agent 3:** Item 4 (92)
- **Agent 4:** Item 0 (93)
- **Agent 5:** Item 3 (84)

With the remaining items (2 and 7), we consider the next highest valuations:
- **Agent 0:** Item 2 (67)
- **Agent 4:** Item 7 (87)

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 7],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and the distribution tries to maximize satisfaction based on their highest valuations.
