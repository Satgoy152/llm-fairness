Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  99  38   1  95  65  99  69
1  78  30  46   7  41  15  67  47
2  20   4  82  53  41  36  28  83
3  70  82  96  10  46  39   7  42
4  13  67  22  38   7  97  36  26
5   0  16  19  11  81  15  69  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, meaning each agent should feel they are receiving the best deal possible given their preferences. 

To achieve this, we can use an approach similar to the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining unallocated items. This ensures each agent has a fair chance to get high-value items according to their preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

1. **Initial Round**:
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 99).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 78).
   - Agent 2 picks item 7 (value 83).
   - Agent 3 picks item 2 (value 96).
   - Agent 4 picks item 5 (value 97).
   - Agent 5 picks item 4 (value 81).

2. **Second Round**:
   - Remaining items: [3, 6]
   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 99).
   - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 7).

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

Each agent has received at least one item, and we have distributed all 8 items with consideration for the fairness of the allocation based on their valuations.
