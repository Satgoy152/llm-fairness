Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  73  53  11  49  46  74  16
1  27  40  49  12  55  46  97  74
2  80  86  40   0  20  19  82  40
3  29  90   6   7  54  34  22  92
4  40   4  14  77  58  34  56  63
5  61  20  95  74  57   8  66  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to minimize envy, we can use a method such as the "round-robin" allocation or a variant of the "maximum marginal utility." In this case, I'll aim to allocate items by considering each agent's highest valuation for an unallocated item, iterating through the agents until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initialize**: Start with all items unallocated and all agents with empty allocations.
2. **Iterate through agents**: In order, each agent picks their most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet.
3. **Continue the process**: Repeat until all items are allocated.

Following this method, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Consider their highest valued item first. Item 0 (value 87) is chosen.
- **Agent 1**: Their highest valued unallocated item is item 6 (value 97).
- **Agent 2**: Their highest valued unallocated item is item 1 (value 86).
- **Agent 3**: Their highest valued unallocated item is item 7 (value 92).
- **Agent 4**: Their highest valued unallocated item is item 4 (value 58).
- **Agent 5**: Their highest valued unallocated item is item 2 (value 95).

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. We still need to allocate items 3 and 5:

- **Continue with Agent 0**: The next highest valued unallocated item is item 5 (value 46).
- **Continue with Agent 1**: The next highest valued unallocated item is item 3 (value 12).

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the preferences of each agent based on their highest valuations, aiming for a fair distribution.
