Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  30  92  82  46  72  47   0
1  61  45  69  67  20  26  75  78
2   9  41  63  72  14  23  71  39
3   2  95  10   6  13  46  67  70
4  12  69   0  20  73  72  48  49
5  77  83  69  52  82  33  15  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction and minimizes envy. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, each agent may not receive an item, but we strive for a distribution that should be as fair as possible.

To achieve this, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility while aiming for envy-freeness. One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that the total number of allocated items is exactly 8.

Let's begin by analyzing the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most at 77.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 95.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 82.
- Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most at 82.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 72.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 75.
- Item 7: Agent 5 values it the most at 83.

To ensure that no one agent gets all the items, let's distribute them while maintaining the highest possible satisfaction for each agent:

1. Allocate items based on the highest valuations:
   - Item 0 to Agent 5
   - Item 1 to Agent 3
   - Item 2 to Agent 0
   - Item 3 to Agent 0
   - Item 4 to Agent 5
   - Item 5 to Agent 0
   - Item 6 to Agent 1
   - Item 7 to Agent 5

Since Agent 0 and Agent 5 are given more than two items, let's redistribute to maintain fairness:

2. Refine the allocation for balance:
   - Give item 2 to Agent 2 (highest remaining valuation)
   - Give item 3 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation)
   - Reallocate item 4 to Agent 4 (second highest remaining valuation)

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [3, 4]
- Agent 5: [0, 7]

Here's the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [0, 7]
}
```
