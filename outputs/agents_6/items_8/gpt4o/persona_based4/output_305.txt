Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  64  31  68  14  79  41  74
1  58  99  14  13  76  67  81  76
2  41  17  78  70  76  74  89  14
3  28  14  13  10  51  89  51  76
4  49  58  85  78  73  29  36   9
5  58   6  82  18   4  50  77  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum value. This method aims to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their own valuation. Here is how the allocation can be done:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the highest with a value of 79.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest with a value of 99.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the highest with a value of 89.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the highest with a value of 89, but it is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 7 with a value of 76.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the highest with a value of 85.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 2 the highest with a value of 82, but it is already allocated to Agent 4. The next highest is item 0 with a value of 58.

Now, allocate the remaining items in a way that each agent has at least one item and the allocation is fair:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (79)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (99)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (89)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (76)
- Agent 4: Item 2 (85)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (58)

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 4. Let's assign them based on the highest remaining values:

- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 2, who values it at 70.
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 1, who values it at 76.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [6, 3]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [0]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```
