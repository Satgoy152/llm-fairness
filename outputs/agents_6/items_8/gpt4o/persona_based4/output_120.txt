Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  60  57  35   4  72  44   5
1  89  13  99  49  12  26  34   3
2  40  55   3  64  98  37   3   3
3  75  64  82  39  70  27  20  54
4  65  59  66  42  24  35  31  90
5  22  36  84  19  98  89  25  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness in terms of minimizing envy and ensuring that each agent feels they are getting a reasonable share of value according to their own valuations. We will attempt this by considering each agent's preferences and the overall distribution of values among the items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** (valuations: 94, 60, 57, 35, 4, 72, 44, 5):
   - Highest value item: 0 (94)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** (valuations: 89, 13, 99, 49, 12, 26, 34, 3):
   - Highest value item: 2 (99)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** (valuations: 40, 55, 3, 64, 98, 37, 3, 3):
   - Highest value item: 4 (98)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** (valuations: 75, 64, 82, 39, 70, 27, 20, 54):
   - Highest value item: 2 (82), but it's already taken.
   - Next highest: 0 (75), but it's already taken.
   - Next highest: 4 (70), but it's already taken.
   - Next highest: 1 (64)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** (valuations: 65, 59, 66, 42, 24, 35, 31, 90):
   - Highest value item: 7 (90)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5** (valuations: 22, 36, 84, 19, 98, 89, 25, 48):
   - Highest value item: 4 (98) and 5 (89), but 4 is already taken.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

7. Remaining items [3, 6] need to be allocated considering current allocations:
   - **Agent 0** has 94 (item 0), consider next available highest valued items:
     - Item 6 (44) is the highest available.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1** has 99 (item 2), consider next available highest valued items:
     - Item 3 (49) is highest available for Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value with minimal envy.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
