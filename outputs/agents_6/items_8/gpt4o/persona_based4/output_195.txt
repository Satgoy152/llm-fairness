Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  32  90  21  56  71  76  81
1  83  97  10  15  27  71  93  42
2  29  18  67  54  19  63  36  34
3  41  94  25  84   8   8  36  57
4  25  70  20  92  62  63  62  51
5  13  76  74  85  36  82  74  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among agents such that envy-freeness is optimized, we will consider the valuations and try to distribute items so that each agent feels they have received a fair portion according to their personal valuations. We can use a simple strategy like the envy-free item assignment through a round-robin approach, where agents take turns picking the most valued item from what remains. This is not guaranteed to be completely envy-free, but it is a practical approach for the problem size and constraints.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 2 (90), so assign item 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 1 (97), so assign item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 0 (29), but already taken. Next highest is item 5 (63), so assign item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 1 (94), but already taken. Next highest is item 3 (84), so assign item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 3 (92), but already taken. Next highest is item 1 (70), but taken. Then item 4 (62), so assign item 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 3 (85), but already taken. Next highest is item 5 (82), but taken. Then item 7 (84), so assign item 7.

Now, we have assigned 6 out of the 8 items. We need to assign 2 more items from the remaining pool: [0, 6].

7. **Agent 0**: Next highest available value is item 6 (76), so assign item 6.
8. **Agent 1**: Next highest available value is item 0 (83), so assign item 0.

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their valuation given the constraints, and all 8 items are allocated.
