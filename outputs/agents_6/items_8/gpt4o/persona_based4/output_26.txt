Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  78  27  30  75  67  51  16
1  16  67  51   9  27  83  25  57
2  74  89  99  82  32   7  81  46
3  33  14   9  14  64  83  80  36
4  72   1  68  99  36  67  17  83
5  29  93  17  89  18  41  64  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations. A common approach to achieve fairness is to look for an allocation that is envy-free, meaning that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

Given the valuations provided, a fair allocation can be attempted by assigning items to agents in such a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that no agent envies another. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 4 are of high value to agent 0. Assign these items to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Item 5 is highly valued by agent 1. Assign item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Items 2 and 3 are highly valued by agent 2. Assign these items to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Item 6 is highly valued by agent 3. Assign item 6 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Item 7 is highly valued by agent 4. Assign item 7 to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Item 1 is highly valued by agent 5. Assign item 1 to agent 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, potentially minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation covers all 8 items and ensures that each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items.
