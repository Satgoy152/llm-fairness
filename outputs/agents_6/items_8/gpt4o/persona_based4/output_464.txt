Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  51  71  47  52  91  25   0
1  13  68  62  63  77  52  40  57
2   9  11   6  89  25  67  79  78
3  35   5   6  43  38  17  19  65
4  87  63  49  60  91  13  11  33
5   6  19  80  51  19  77  12  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in all situations, we'll strive for a balanced allocation that respects the preferences of the agents as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Determine Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their relative preferences.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are distributed.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   If necessary, adjust the allocations to balance the total value received by each agent, ensuring that no agent is significantly disadvantaged.

Now, let's proceed with the calculations and allocations:

### Step 1: Total Valuation for Each Agent
- Agent 0: 37 + 51 + 71 + 47 + 52 + 91 + 25 + 0 = 374
- Agent 1: 13 + 68 + 62 + 63 + 77 + 52 + 40 + 57 = 432
- Agent 2: 9 + 11 + 6 + 89 + 25 + 67 + 79 + 78 = 364
- Agent 3: 35 + 5 + 6 + 43 + 38 + 17 + 19 + 65 = 208
- Agent 4: 87 + 63 + 49 + 60 + 91 + 13 + 11 + 33 = 407
- Agent 5: 6 + 19 + 80 + 51 + 19 + 77 + 12 + 89 = 353

### Step 2: Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation
- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the highest (87)
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest (68)
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the highest (80)
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest (89)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest (52)
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest (91)
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the highest (79)
- Item 7: Agent 5 values it the highest (89)

### Step 3: Adjust for Fairness
- Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and the total value perceived by each agent is balanced.

By considering the above steps, the allocation becomes:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the distribution aims to respect the highest valuations as closely as possible while considering the total perceived value by each agent.
