Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  47  19  39  89  54  46  61
1  15  71  77  30  26  85  89  31
2  97  98  72  64  77  99  88  40
3  40  16  25  21  78  55  94  54
4  41  88  19  99   9  40  99  28
5  42  88  58  62   4  71  24  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents, we will use an approach based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We'll attempt to balance the allocation so that no agent feels significantly worse off than others.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 31 + 47 + 19 + 39 + 89 + 54 + 46 + 61 = 386
- Agent 1: 15 + 71 + 77 + 30 + 26 + 85 + 89 + 31 = 424
- Agent 2: 97 + 98 + 72 + 64 + 77 + 99 + 88 + 40 = 635
- Agent 3: 40 + 16 + 25 + 21 + 78 + 55 + 94 + 54 = 383
- Agent 4: 41 + 88 + 19 + 99 + 9 + 40 + 99 + 28 = 423
- Agent 5: 42 + 88 + 58 + 62 + 4 + 71 + 24 + 70 = 419

Given there are 8 items and 6 agents, we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item, and some agents will receive more than one. We will start by giving each agent their highest-valued item and then adjust from there to balance the allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (99). Give item 5 to agent 2.
2. Agent 2 also values item 1 the highest (98). Give item 1 to agent 2.
3. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (99). Give item 3 to agent 4.
4. Agent 4 also values item 6 the highest (99). Give item 6 to agent 4.
5. Agent 5 values item 1 the highest (88), but it is taken. The next highest is item 7 (70). Give item 7 to agent 5.
6. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (89), but it is taken. The next highest is item 2 (77). Give item 2 to agent 1.
7. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (89). Give item 4 to agent 0.
8. Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (94), but it is taken. The next highest is item 4 (78), but it is also taken. The next highest is item 7 (54), but it is taken. The next highest is item 5 (55), but it is taken. The next highest is item 0 (40). Give item 0 to agent 3.

Now let's allocate the remaining items to the agents with fewer items, ensuring minimal envy:

- Agent 0 has item 4.
- Agent 1 has item 2.
- Agent 2 has items 1 and 5.
- Agent 3 has item 0.
- Agent 4 has items 3 and 6.
- Agent 5 has item 7.

Let's finalize the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, all items are allocated, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
