Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  44  23  26  19  52  66  79
1  87  51  23  21  54  87  15  34
2  61  63  15  13  73  99  35  14
3  13  16  93  43  24  30  31  39
4  93  27  45  38  73  43  70  52
5  34  94   5  32  18  91  46  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a manner that aims for envy-freeness, we can use a simple heuristic approach. This problem involves assigning 8 items to 6 agents, which means that some agents will receive more than one item while others may receive none. 

In order to simplify this allocation, let's consider a few strategies:

1. **Maximize individual valuations:** Each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, but this may not ensure fairness overall.
2. **Equalize total valuation:** Attempt to equalize the total valuation of items received by each agent.

To achieve a reasonably fair allocation, let's try to balance these approaches. One potential method is assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, but also ensuring that each agent's total valuation is somewhat balanced.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each item's valuation:

- **Item 0**: Assign to agent 4 (Value: 93)
- **Item 1**: Assign to agent 5 (Value: 94)
- **Item 2**: Assign to agent 3 (Value: 93)
- **Item 3**: Assign to agent 0 (Value: 26)
- **Item 4**: Assign to agent 2 (Value: 73)
- **Item 5**: Assign to agent 2 (Value: 99)
- **Item 6**: Assign to agent 0 (Value: 66)
- **Item 7**: Assign to agent 0 (Value: 79)

Now let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 has items: [3, 6, 7]
- Agent 1 has items: []
- Agent 2 has items: [4, 5]
- Agent 3 has items: [2]
- Agent 4 has items: [0]
- Agent 5 has items: [1]

This allocation ensures all 8 items are assigned, and we attempt to balance the allocation by item appeal. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```
