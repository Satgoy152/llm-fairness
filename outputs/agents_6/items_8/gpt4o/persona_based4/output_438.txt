Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  68  12  12   5  69   6  91
1  58  46  61  80  41  99   2  31
2   0  93  64   8   9  30  94  33
3  94  53  11  12   4  50  20  68
4  90  14   4  19  78  51  53  28
5  22   0  85  84  11  34  45  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute them such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Given that we have six agents and eight items, some agents will naturally receive more items than others. However, the goal is to minimize envy by ensuring each agent feels their allocation is fair based on their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation strategy that aims for fairness:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 5, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the most, so we try to ensure they receive it.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the most.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 the most.

Given these preferences, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: Receives items [1, 7]. These are items they value highly, and item 1 is not the top choice for any other agent.
- Agent 1: Receives item [5]. This is their highest-valued item.
- Agent 2: Receives item [6]. This is their highest-valued item.
- Agent 3: Receives item [0]. This is their highest-valued item.
- Agent 4: Receives item [4]. This is their highest-valued item.
- Agent 5: Receives items [2, 3]. Item 2 is their highest-valued item, and item 3 is a reasonable addition given their preferences and leftover items.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives at least one of their highly-valued items, reducing potential envy.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are allocated, and each agent's allocation is based on their highest-valued preferences.
