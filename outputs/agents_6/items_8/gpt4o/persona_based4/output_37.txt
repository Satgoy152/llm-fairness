Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  83  74  12  88  57  76  87
1   8  75  60  92  91  84  70  89
2  29  93  74  80  70  99  27  49
3  42  92  54  68  66  99  71  89
4  43  87  45  80  35  80  73  37
5  84  17  76  93  29  10  44   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [84 17 76 93 29 10 44  9]]
Output:
To achieve an allocation that is fair, we will aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations. Given there are 8 items and 6 agents, not all agents will receive an equal number of items, but we will attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes total valuations and attempts to minimize envy.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent**: Find the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. **Rank Items per Agent**: Identify which items are most valued by each agent.
3. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by assigning each agent their most valued item, and continue the process while ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

### Calculations:
- **Agent 0**: Total Valuation = 550
- **Agent 1**: Total Valuation = 569
- **Agent 2**: Total Valuation = 521
- **Agent 3**: Total Valuation = 581
- **Agent 4**: Total Valuation = 480
- **Agent 5**: Total Valuation = 362

### Allocation Process:
1. **Agent 3**: Allocates item 5 (highest value: 99)
2. **Agent 1**: Allocates item 3 (highest value: 92)
3. **Agent 5**: Allocates item 0 (highest value: 84)
4. **Agent 2**: Allocates item 1 (highest value: 93)
5. **Agent 0**: Allocates item 4 (highest value: 88)
6. **Agent 4**: Allocates item 6 (highest value: 73)

Remaining Items: 2, 7

7. **Agent 0**: Allocates item 7 (second-highest remaining value: 87)
8. **Agent 3**: Allocates item 2 (second-highest remaining value: 54)

Now, each agent has received at least one item, and all 8 items have been allocated.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and while not perfectly envy-free, it attempts to minimize envy by maximizing the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences for the items.
