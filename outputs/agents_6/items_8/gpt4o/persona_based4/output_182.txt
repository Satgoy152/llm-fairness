Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47   7  92  79  45  84   9  36
1  63  29  49  51  76  75  34  73
2  10  61  43  15  22  82  91  70
3  82  19  25  16  56  69  34  87
4  60  86  50  93  23  39  22  72
5  80  67  78  96  58  50  86  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [80 67 78 96 58 50 86 82]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One way to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" method based on each agent's highest valuation of remaining items. Here's how the allocation can be done step-by-step:

1. Agent 0 picks item 2 with value 92.
2. Agent 1 picks item 0 with value 63.
3. Agent 2 picks item 6 with value 91.
4. Agent 3 picks item 7 with value 87.
5. Agent 4 picks item 3 with value 93.
6. Agent 5 picks item 3 with value 96. (Since item 3 is already taken, next best available item is 0, which is also taken. Next is item 5 with value 50.)
7. Agent 0 picks item 5 with value 84.
8. Agent 1 picks item 4 with value 76.

Now all 8 items have been allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and it attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.
