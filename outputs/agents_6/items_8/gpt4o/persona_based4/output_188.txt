Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  93   4  30  44  64  55  35
1  24  22  49  55  68   2  41   4
2  39  85   9  86  80  62  59  29
3  94   0  61  15  77  31  37  19
4  39  43  58  29  63  35  59   3
5  76  72  48  31  20  98  53  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we first analyze the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation, given their preferences.

Here is a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Look for the highest valuations each agent has for the items.

2. **Attempt to Satisfy High Preferences**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, trying to satisfy each agent's top preferences.

3. **Balance the Number of Items**: Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

4. **Check for Envy**: Adjust the allocation to minimize envy among agents, trying to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Applying this process to the given data:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (93).
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly (68).
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly (86).
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly (94).
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly (59).
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly (98).

Next, we'll allocate items based on these high valuations and then distribute remaining items while considering overall fairness and balance.

Here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [5, 7, 2] (since they have high valuations for item 5 and moderate for others, giving them more items balances overall satisfaction)

The allocations ensure each item is assigned, and no agent is left without an item. The number of items each agent receives is balanced, considering their individual valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5, 7, 2]
}
```
