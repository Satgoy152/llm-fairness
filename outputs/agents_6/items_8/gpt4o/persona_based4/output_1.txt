Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  24  13  55  34  82   2  23
1  43  96  17  23  50   0  17  35
2  58  78  81  51  38  67  32  95
3  75  99  25  84  51  34  86   0
4  91  31  83  95   1   4  29  89
5   2  61  63  86  10   9  51  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation, where possible, and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, not all agents will receive an equal number of items, but we'll try to distribute them fairly based on their valuations.

One reasonable approach is to allocate items to maximize the minimum value each agent perceives they receive, which is a max-min fair allocation. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 3** highly values item 1 and item 0. Allocating these to agent 3 provides them with high satisfaction due to high valuations.

2. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 7. Assign item 7 to agent 2.

3. **Agent 4** highly values item 3 and has significant valuation for item 2. Assign these items to agent 4.

4. **Agent 1** values item 4 highly. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

5. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 5. Assign item 5 to agent 0.

6. **Agent 5** will receive the remaining item, item 6, which has relatively balanced valuation across other allocations.

This allocation considers the agents' preferences in a way that maximizes their perceived value and minimizes envy. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2, 3],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, respecting their preferences and maintaining fairness to the extent possible given the constraints.
