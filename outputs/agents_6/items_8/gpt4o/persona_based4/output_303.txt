Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  22  86  42  15  71   4  67
1  25  65  96  90  89  34  53  12
2  79  93  50  62  19  47  25  32
3  24  92  69  62  77   1  32  58
4  40  43  82  98  92  26  84  37
5   9  71  77  83  74  60  30  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, ensuring that all agents feel they are getting their fair share based on their valuations. We will consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items so that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (79)
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (93)
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1 (96)
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 4 (98)
   - Allocate to Agent 4.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 4 (92)
   - Allocate to Agent 4.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (71)
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 4 (84)
   - Allocate to Agent 4.

8. **Item 7**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (67)
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 4, 6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each item and attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly. Note that while some agents may not receive any items, the allocation process was based on maximizing individual valuations per item, which can sometimes leave some agents with no items if their highest valuations are lower compared to others.
