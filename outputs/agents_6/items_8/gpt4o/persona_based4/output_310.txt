Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  43   2  94  55  22  91  72
1  62  57  37  90  76  63  11  89
2  53  43  86  93  23   3  11  58
3  68  50  46  76  81  66   5  21
4  58  87  53  67  74  23  33  48
5  84  40  99  51  27  12  98  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations and achieving envy-freeness as much as possible, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

One approach is to use a method such as maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives (also known as max-min fairness). This involves allocating items in a way that maximizes the minimum value that any agent receives.

Let's start by evaluating each agent's total valuation if they were to receive each item individually. The goal is to distribute the items to balance these valuations across agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 2 to agent 5: This is agent 5's highest valued item (99).
2. Allocate item 6 to agent 5: This is another high-valued item for agent 5 (98).
3. Allocate item 3 to agent 0: This is agent 0's highest valued item (94).
4. Allocate item 4 to agent 1: This is one of the higher valued items for agent 1 (76).
5. Allocate item 0 to agent 0: Another high-valued item for agent 0 (74).
6. Allocate item 7 to agent 1: This is a significantly valued item for agent 1 (89).
7. Allocate item 1 to agent 4: This is the highest valued item for agent 4 (87).
8. Allocate item 5 to agent 3: This is a reasonably valued item for agent 3 (66).

This distribution aims to give each agent a fair share of the items according to their preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item of reasonably high value according to their individual valuation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

Note: Agent 2 receives no items in this allocation as their valuations are generally lower compared to other agents for the unallocated items. However, this scenario maximizes the sum of high-valued items for other agents. Adjustments might be made if a different fairness criterion is prioritized.
