Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  86  78  39  40  77  56   5
1  84   5  48  76  82  83  68  84
2  14  90   7  55  58  10   5  88
3  29  44  12  15  73  30  96  18
4  13  42  51  32   2  29   1   6
5  25  60  88  82  64  46  43  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we can use the method of maximizing the total utility while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 6 agents and 8 items, it is important to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels satisfied with their share, and no agent envies another.

One common approach is to use the method of "round-robin" allocation, where agents take turns picking the item they value the most among the remaining items. However, to tailor it towards envy-freeness, we might need to prioritize agents who might otherwise end up with a low total value.

Let's carry out the allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has a strong preference for item 0 (value 84), so let's assign that to them first.
2. **Agent 0** values item 1 most (value 86), so we'll assign it to them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 most (value 88), so we'll assign it to them.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 most (value 96), so we'll assign that to them.
5. **Agent 5** values item 2 most (value 88), so we'll assign that to them.
6. **Agent 4** doesn't have a particularly high value, but the next highest from remaining items is item 3 (value 32), so we'll assign it to them.
7. **Agent 1** again, as they had a low value item 0, gets item 4 (value 82).
8. **Agent 0** can get item 5 (value 77), as the last item left.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize the satisfaction based on their highest preferences. Now let's format this into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```
