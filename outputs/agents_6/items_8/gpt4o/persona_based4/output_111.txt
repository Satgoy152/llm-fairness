Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  77  81  52  56  63  52  70
1  26  78  25  18  86   6  39  63
2  75  90  80  82  46  55  91  67
3  82  93  58  54   5  54  79  76
4  52   3  61  91  60  24  84  33
5  54  43  78  46  58  84  81  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Our goal is to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy among agents and attempts to achieve as close to an envy-free allocation as possible given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: First, identify which items have the highest valuations for each agent. This will help prioritize allocations based on preference.

2. **Assign High-Value Items**: Allocate items starting from the highest valuation to the respective agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than two items initially.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: After assigning the high-value items, check if any agent has received more than two items or if any agent has not received any item. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent has at least one item, redistributing items if necessary.

4. **Ensure All Items are Allocated**: Finally, distribute any remaining items by considering the next highest values for each agent, ensuring all items are allocated.

By applying the steps above, here's a fair allocation of the items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value relatively highly while ensuring fairness across the board.
