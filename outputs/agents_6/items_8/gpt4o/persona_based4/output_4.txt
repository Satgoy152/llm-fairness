Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  35  81  98  51  95  94  55
1  66  33  42  63  85  45  33  74
2  29  47  95  45  65  56  88  39
3  26  90  61  72  29   9  42  29
4  81  41  61  82  13  23  21  97
5  17  62  96  69  36  36  40  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, ideally minimizing envy among agents. We want to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as valuable as possible.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(41 + 35 + 81 + 98 + 51 + 95 + 94 + 55 = 550\)
- Agent 1: \(66 + 33 + 42 + 63 + 85 + 45 + 33 + 74 = 441\)
- Agent 2: \(29 + 47 + 95 + 45 + 65 + 56 + 88 + 39 = 464\)
- Agent 3: \(26 + 90 + 61 + 72 + 29 + 9 + 42 + 29 = 358\)
- Agent 4: \(81 + 41 + 61 + 82 + 13 + 23 + 21 + 97 = 419\)
- Agent 5: \(17 + 62 + 96 + 69 + 36 + 36 + 40 + 39 = 395\)

Now, let's allocate the items in a way that attempts to maximize the perceived value for each agent, potentially reducing envy. A simple way is to allocate items one by one, starting with the agent who values the current item the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

**Proposed Allocation:**
- Item 0: Agent 4 (value 81)
- Item 1: Agent 3 (value 90)
- Item 2: Agent 5 (value 96)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (value 98)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (value 85)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 95)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (value 88)
- Item 7: Agent 4 (value 97)

**Allocation Summary:**
- Agent 0: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [1]
- Agent 4: Items [0, 7]
- Agent 5: Items [2]

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 7],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items in a way that considers the highest valuation each agent has for the items, aiming to reduce envy and ensure each person feels they received a valuable share.
