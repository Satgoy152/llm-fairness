Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  37  16  91  78  71  34  56
1  82  82  94  65  79  44  50  90
2  17  56  29  52  21  75  18  32
3  90   0   5  56  32  58  64  79
4  15  65  44  34   5  56   9  10
5  34  10  38  97  14  35  54  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider principles like envy-freeness and efficiency. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness in all cases can be complex, especially with integer constraints and differing valuations. Here, we'll attempt to generate a fair allocation based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0's highest-valued items**: Item 3 (value 91), Item 4 (value 78)
2. **Agent 1's highest-valued items**: Item 2 (value 94), Item 7 (value 90)
3. **Agent 2's highest-valued item**: Item 5 (value 75)
4. **Agent 3's highest-valued item**: Item 0 (value 90)
5. **Agent 4's highest-valued item**: Item 1 (value 65)
6. **Agent 5's highest-valued item**: Item 6 (value 54)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one highly-valued item, minimizing potential envy.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and ensures each agent receives items they highly value, promoting fairness.
