Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  94   6  65  54   6  64  92
1  18  87  23  79  88  11  77  55
2  56  81   8   5  96  98  46  66
3  45  35  66  87   6  25  25  86
4  97   0  21  58  49  25  62   3
5  71  92  45  39  34  59  20  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation where each agent is as satisfied as possible given their preferences. An envy-free allocation is ideal, but it may not always be achievable with integer allocations. Here, I'll try to distribute the items based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

The valuations are as follows (agent x item):

```
Agent 0:  [1, 94, 6, 65, 54, 6, 64, 92]
Agent 1:  [18, 87, 23, 79, 88, 11, 77, 55]
Agent 2:  [56, 81, 8, 5, 96, 98, 46, 66]
Agent 3:  [45, 35, 66, 87, 6, 25, 25, 86]
Agent 4:  [97, 0, 21, 58, 49, 25, 62, 3]
Agent 5:  [71, 92, 45, 39, 34, 59, 20, 95]
```

To achieve a fair allocation:
1. Identify each agent's highest-valued items.
2. Try to assign the highest-valued items to each agent without causing significant envy.
3. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, while respecting the total of 8 items.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 94)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 88)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 98)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 87)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (value 97)
- Assign item 7 to Agent 5 (value 95)

Now, two items remain to be allocated. To distribute them while minimizing potential envy, we consider the next highest available values:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 77)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 66)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is made as equitably as possible given the constraints.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7]
}
```
