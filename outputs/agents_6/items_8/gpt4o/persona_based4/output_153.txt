Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  24  56  55  30  62   4  96
1  78  72  51  50  65  66  33   2
2   9   6  34  70  36  38  58  32
3  85  17  55  27   7  34  98  30
4  17  63  19  26  57  56  74  86
5  38  81  69  56  63  45  91  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we strive for a balanced allocation based on the agents' valuations.

We start by looking at the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation is maximized while also ensuring fairness. We can use a method similar to the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach, where agents select items in order of preference or priority.

Below is a proposed allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 7.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly.
5. Agent 4 can take item 4.
6. Agent 5 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.

Considering these observations, here's a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items in a way that reflects agents' preferences while ensuring all items are allocated and every agent has a fair chance at items they value highly. Each agent receives at least one item, except for agents with inherently lower total valuations, which can help balance the overall fairness.
