Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  32  40  43  21   5  61  99
1   3  97  87  58  38  20  87  67
2  57  16  26  78  78  73  82   1
3  81  17  36  89  81  41  43  15
4  19  53  89  28  55  36  51  26
5  10  65  34  45  47  70  25  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we are looking for an allocation method that considers individual valuations and tries to ensure envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints, we can aim to balance the total value each agent receives.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has over all the items:

- Agent 0: 13 + 32 + 40 + 43 + 21 + 5 + 61 + 99 = 314
- Agent 1: 3 + 97 + 87 + 58 + 38 + 20 + 87 + 67 = 457
- Agent 2: 57 + 16 + 26 + 78 + 78 + 73 + 82 + 1 = 411
- Agent 3: 81 + 17 + 36 + 89 + 81 + 41 + 43 + 15 = 403
- Agent 4: 19 + 53 + 89 + 28 + 55 + 36 + 51 + 26 = 357
- Agent 5: 10 + 65 + 34 + 45 + 47 + 70 + 25 + 36 = 332

To achieve a fair distribution, we need to ensure that the total value each agent perceives from their allocation is approximately balanced.

Let's try to allocate the items by considering both the total value and the distribution of item values among the agents:

1. Assign the highest-valued item for each agent sequentially, ensuring no overlap:
    - Agent 0 should get item 7 (value 99).
    - Agent 1 should get item 1 (value 97).
    - Agent 2 should get item 6 (value 82).
    - Agent 3 should get item 3 (value 89).
    - Agent 4 should get item 2 (value 89).
    - Agent 5 should get item 5 (value 70).

2. Assign the remaining items (0, 4) to balance the total perceived value:
    - Agent 0 can take item 0 (value 13) since their next highest value after 7 is relatively low.
    - Agent 1 can take item 4 (value 38) to balance their high initial allocation.

Now, let's check the allocations and ensure there are no overlaps and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items [7, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [2]
- Agent 5: Items [5]

Total items allocated: 8, which satisfies the requirement.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```
