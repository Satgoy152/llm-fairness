Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  19  37  98  52  93  34  83
1  10  92  27  10  14  46  78  57
2  17  78  23  12  74  14  60  56
3  65  45  83  21  85   4   3  39
4  74  87  59  23  95  52  95  26
5  31  55   8  11  57   6  65  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations, we'll try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

First, let's consider the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 509
- Agent 1: 334
- Agent 2: 334
- Agent 3: 345
- Agent 4: 511
- Agent 5: 266

Now, let's proceed with the allocation by attempting to minimize envy and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the most. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values items 4 and 0 the most, but item 4 is already allocated. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 6 the most. Allocate item 6 to Agent 5.

At this point, every agent has received at least one item, and we have two items remaining: items 5 and 7.

7. **Item 5**: The remaining highest valuation for item 5 is by Agent 0. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: The remaining highest valuation for item 7 is by Agent 1. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy the conditions of fair division by considering each agent's highest preferences and ensuring that every agent receives a portion of the total value.
