Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  22  60  24  58  84  37  72
1  22  99  64  48  85  69  97  94
2  44  75  38  36  46  59  56  54
3  46  14  56  53  49  59   8   7
4  19  77  87  82  51  37  73   4
5  85  83  32  60  51  42  86  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences. We'll use an approach that attempts to balance total value across agents while considering their individual valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items, which can help guide our allocation:

- Agent 0: 55 + 22 + 60 + 24 + 58 + 84 + 37 + 72 = 412
- Agent 1: 22 + 99 + 64 + 48 + 85 + 69 + 97 + 94 = 578
- Agent 2: 44 + 75 + 38 + 36 + 46 + 59 + 56 + 54 = 408
- Agent 3: 46 + 14 + 56 + 53 + 49 + 59 + 8 + 7 = 292
- Agent 4: 19 + 77 + 87 + 82 + 51 + 37 + 73 + 4 = 430
- Agent 5: 85 + 83 + 32 + 60 + 51 + 42 + 86 + 91 = 530

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value of 99 for Agent 1).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value of 84 for Agent 0).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (value of 86 for Agent 5).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value of 87 for Agent 4).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value of 85 for Agent 1).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (value of 82 for Agent 4).
7. Assign item 0 to Agent 5 (value of 85 for Agent 5).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 5 (value of 91 for Agent 5).

This allocation considers the highest value each agent places on unallocated items at each step, ensuring that the overall distribution attempts to balance total values.

Let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 3],
    "5": [0, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to fairly distribute them based on the agents' valuations.
