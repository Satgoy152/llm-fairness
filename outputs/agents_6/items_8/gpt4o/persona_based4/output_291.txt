Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  81  35  93  44  16  16  76
1  60  72  65  47  46  82  36  33
2  36  80  32  92  84  36  31   0
3   7  86  56  92  17   8  63  43
4  69  40  90  92  42  84  29  29
5  78  81  56  93  95  34  59  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can utilize a method that considers each agent's valuation of the items and attempts to distribute the items such that all agents feel they have received their fair share based on their valuation.

Given the valuation matrix, we will allocate the items by assessing which agent values each item the most and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from agent 5 (value 78).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from agent 0 (value 81).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from agent 4 (value 90).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from agent 5 (value 93).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from agent 5 (value 95).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is from agent 1 (value 82).
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is from agent 3 (value 63).
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is from agent 5 (value 98).

Next, we need to ensure that each agent has at least one item, if possible, and adjust allocations to maintain fairness:

- Agent 0 has item 1.
- Agent 1 has item 5.
- Agent 2 currently has no items, so we will adjust by giving agent 2 item 0, which they value relatively highly (36) compared to the remaining allocations.
- Agent 3 has item 6.
- Agent 4 has item 2.
- Agent 5 has items 3, 4, and 7.

Here's the final allocation ensuring all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and the allocation is done based on maximizing individual valuations under the constraint of providing at least one item to each agent.
