Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  10  61  96  32  30  81  90
1  72  57  33  37   6  69  89  99
2  41  93  95  23   1  95  37   7
3  62  34  98  14  17  29  61  52
4  50  73  90   1  37  60  13  73
5  15  15  82  93  13  33  71  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which maximizes the product of the agents' utilities. This approach often results in allocations that are both efficient and envy-free, or nearly so, in practice.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Utilities**: Each agent's utility for a bundle of items is the sum of the valuations of those items.

2. **Allocation Approach**: We aim to allocate items such that the product of the utilities is maximized. Since we have 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none.

3. **Initial Allocation**: We first check high-value items for each agent to ensure that those items are allocated in a way that maximizes individual utilities without causing substantial envy.

4. **Iterative Improvement**: Adjust allocations iteratively to maximize the Nash welfare, trying to balance total utility across agents while ensuring no one envies anotherâ€™s allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 3, and 7.
- Agent 1 highly values item 7.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 4 has high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most.

After considering these and trying to balance out the allocations, we achieve the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that approximately maximizes their utility given the constraints, and all 8 items are distributed.
