Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  54  24  63  57  19  48  72
1  91  23  34  84  81  45  15  30
2  37  37  30  31  89  10  43  51
3  59  29  30  84  71  93  13   5
4  77   4  37  31  15  75  91   0
5  75   6  61   5   3  59  97  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels they have received an equitable portion of the items based on their valuations. One approach to achieve this is to consider the method of "envy-freeness," where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocated bundle. 

Given the valuations in the table, we can proceed with the allocation process, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and adjusting for fair division based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent Preferences:** Analyze each agent's highest valued items and try to allocate those items first to minimize envy.
2. **Initial High-Value Allocations:** Begin by assigning the highest valued items to each agent, ensuring no overlap.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Once each agent has at least one item, we can adjust allocations to ensure no agent envies another's allocation given the remaining items.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is for Item 7 (72).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is for Item 0 (91).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is for Item 4 (89).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value is for Item 5 (93).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value is for Item 6 (91).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest value is for Item 6 (97), but it's already allocated. Next, Item 0 (75), but it's also allocated. Next highest is Item 2 (61).

Now, adjust and allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: After allocating Item 7 to Agent 0, next best options are Items 1 (54) and 4 (57).
- **Agent 1**: Has Item 0. Next best is Item 3 (84).
- **Agent 2**: Has Item 4. Next best is Item 6 (43).
- **Agent 3**: Has Item 5. Next best is Item 3 (84), but it's allocated. Next Item 4 (71), but it's allocated. Next Item 0 (59), but it's allocated. Next Item 2 (30).
- **Agent 4**: Has Item 6. Next best is Item 0 (77), but it's allocated. Next Item 5 (75), but it's allocated. Next Item 2 (37).
- **Agent 5**: Has Item 2. Next best is Item 5 (59), but it's allocated. Next Item 3 (5).

Now, compile the final allocations ensuring each agent has items and no overlap occurs:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, minimizing envy among the agents.
