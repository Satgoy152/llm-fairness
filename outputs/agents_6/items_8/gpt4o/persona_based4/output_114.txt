Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  52   2  26   8  82  76  24
1  33  71  88  68  44  60   6  28
2  54  50  44  30  52  29  75  30
3  11   5  60  28  38  38  15  97
4  15  27  73  75  67  54  88  58
5  72   4  48  42  98   9  55  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [72  4 48 42 98  9 55 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a solution that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy among agents. Given the valuations table, we'll first consider the fair division concept and then allocate items based on maximizing individual satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

0     72  52   2  26   8  82  76  24
1     33  71  88  68  44  60   6  28
2     54  50  44  30  52  29  75  30
3     11   5  60  28  38  38  15  97
4     15  27  73  75  67  54  88  58
5     72   4  48  42  98   9  55  53
```

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify Highest Valuation Per Item:** Each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Check for Envy-Freeness:** Adjust allocations to ensure each agent is satisfied or to minimize envy.

### Allocation Steps
1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the highest with 72.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the highest with 71.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it the highest with 88.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 4 values it the highest with 75.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 5 values it the highest with 98.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the highest with 82.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 4 values it the highest with 88.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 3 values it the highest with 97.

### Adjusted Allocation for Fairness
To ensure no agent is left without any items, we reassign items to distribute at least one item per agent:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 2: Item [6]
- Agent 3: Item [7]
- Agent 4: Item [3]
- Agent 5: Item [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

### Final Allocations

    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
