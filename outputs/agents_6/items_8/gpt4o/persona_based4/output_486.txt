Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  78  38  19  13   0  83  65
1  54  96  74  12  75  71  36   0
2  93  24  72  71  12  74  15  36
3  41  46  47  60   5  51  38  19
4  69  84  57  59  97  76  28   4
5  89  45  43  88  13   1  50  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the allocation of any other agent over their own. Given the constraints (6 agents and 8 items), it's challenging to achieve complete envy-freeness, but we can strive for a fair outcome by maximizing the total value each agent receives according to their preferences.

Let's follow a simple sequential allocation process where each agent picks the most valuable item available to them in a round-robin fashion. We'll assume the agents pick in the order 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and repeat until all items are allocated.

1. **First Round:**
    - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 83).
    - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 96).
    - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 93).
    - Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 60).
    - Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 97).
    - Agent 5 picks item 7 (value 83).

2. **Second Round:**
    - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 65).
    - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 74).

Now all items have been allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, aiming to approach fairness given the constraints.
