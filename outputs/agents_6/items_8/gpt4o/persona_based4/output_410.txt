Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  70  27  27  33  28  88  94
1  81  71  79  87   2  75  87   1
2  18  90  65  64  88  15  31  74
3  67  31  31  57  86  36  58   4
4  51  83  43  63   8  43  93  97
5  27  35  84  84  37  46  17  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that minimizes envy. A common approach to achieve this is by using the Envy-Free (EF) allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Given the valuations, let's try to assign the items to agents such that the allocations are as envy-free as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items are 0, 7, and 6. Let's assign item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item is 3. Let's assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item is 1. Let's assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued item (not yet assigned) is 4. Let's assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued item (not yet assigned) is 7, but it's taken. Next highest is 6. Let's assign item 6 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest valued item is 2. Let's assign item 2 to Agent 5.

Now, let's assign the remaining items to achieve a fair distribution:

7. **Remaining items (0, 5)**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second-highest value after 7).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (next highest value after 3).

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide a balance where each agent gets their most valued available items, minimizing potential envy.
