Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  84  56  25  47  41   6  78
1  67  60  82  92  74  64  72  67
2  62  36  96  78  28   5  84  27
3  40  79  17  81  26  29  42  55
4  58  98  91  53  18  84  95  60
5  84  58  42  37  10  38  13  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [84 58 42 37 10 38 13 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, aiming for an envy-free or as close to envy-free solution as possible, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share given their preferences.

One strategy is to use a round-robin process based on the agents' highest valued items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and that the distribution feels fair according to their valuations.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 4** values item 1 the highest (98). Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
2. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (96). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (92). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 7 the highest (78). Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest, but it's taken. Next highest is item 1, which is taken. Next is item 0 (40). Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 the highest, but it's taken. Next is item 7, which is taken. Next is item 1, which is taken. Next is item 2, which is taken. Next is item 5 (38). Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, each agent has received one item. We still have items 4 and 6 left.

7. **Agent 4** has the next highest valuation for item 6 (95). Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
8. **Agent 1** has the next highest valuation for item 4 (74). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [5]
}
```
