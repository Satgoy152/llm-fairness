Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25   0  81  74  21  77  47  97
1  92  71  13   4  42   9  68   6
2  29  88  57  40  43  45  61  23
3  31  74  39  81  88  59   8  41
4  34   1  51  85  14   3  75  28
5  78  20  40  83  51   7  97  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value any other agent's allocation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations, we'll focus on a fair distribution where each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Let's start by analyzing the given valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, 3, and 7.
- Agent 1 highly values items 0, 1, and 6.
- Agent 2 highly values items 1, 2, and 6.
- Agent 3 highly values items 3, 4, and 5.
- Agent 4 highly values items 3, 6, and 7.
- Agent 5 highly values items 0, 3, and 6.

Now, we will attempt an allocation. We will prioritize giving each agent at least one of their most valued items if possible while ensuring that all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for this item).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for this item).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for this item).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 5 (highest value for this item).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for this item).
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (highest value for this item).
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (second highest value).
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (second highest value).

### Resulting Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be as fair as possible based on the highest values each agent places on the items, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives some benefit from their allocation.
