Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  94  95  49  29  78  77  35
1  28  69   9  59  21  25  57  42
2  73  11   9  47  30  85  72   8
3  23  12  28  89  51  86  48  85
4  71   4  13  64  54  71  28  49
5  27  18  56  48  58   2  31  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the six agents while ensuring envy-freeness or as close as possible, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or attempting to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Given there are eight items and six agents, not all agents will receive an equal number of items, which makes perfect envy-freeness challenging. However, we can strive for a balanced allocation.

First, let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [34, 94, 95, 49, 29, 78, 77, 35]
Agent 1: [28, 69, 9, 59, 21, 25, 57, 42]
Agent 2: [73, 11, 9, 47, 30, 85, 72, 8]
Agent 3: [23, 12, 28, 89, 51, 86, 48, 85]
Agent 4: [71, 4, 13, 64, 54, 71, 28, 49]
Agent 5: [27, 18, 56, 48, 58, 2, 31, 45]
```

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. Identify items that have a high valuation for specific agents compared to others, and allocate those items to them.
2. Ensure that each agent receives a set of items that gives them a reasonable total value, trying to balance the sum of the values across agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (73), allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (94), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (95), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (89), allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Agent 5 values it the most (58), allocate to Agent 5.
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most (86), allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it (77), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it (85), allocate to Agent 3.

This allocation strategy attempts to give each agent a high-value item or set of items relative to their preferences, subject to the constraint of distributing all items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 5, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation gives each agent high-valued items according to their preferences, although Agent 1 and Agent 4 receive no items due to the limited number of items and the need to maximize the overall perceived fairness.
