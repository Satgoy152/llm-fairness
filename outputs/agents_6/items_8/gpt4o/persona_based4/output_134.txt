Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  36  26  20  97  17  69   2
1  52  32  69  46  59  78  92   8
2  89  53  53   1  92   0   5  38
3  64  96  57  39  26  91  72  71
4  35  72  80  40  27  88  61  30
5  68  65  88  63  80   2  55  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation as much as possible given their valuations. One common approach to achieve this is to use an envy-free allocation or a method that minimizes envy.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (97) and item 6 (69). To maximize their satisfaction, we allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 (78) and 6 (92), but since item 6 is already allocated, we give them item 5.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (89) and item 4 (92), but since item 4 is already allocated, we assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 1 (96), so we allocate this item to them.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 (80) highly, so we allocate this item to them.
6. **Agent 5** has high valuations for item 2 (88) and item 4 (80), but since both are already allocated, we give them item 3 (63) and item 7 (59), which are among the highest available remaining valuations for them.

This allocation seeks to respect the agents' highest preferences as much as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation uses all 8 items and aims to minimize envy among agents by respecting their highest-valued items as much as possible.
