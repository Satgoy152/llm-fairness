Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  71  14  99   0  39   5   8
1  80  94  37  91  86  99  49  67
2  91  84  45  88   7  99  92   4
3  18  29  10  53  55  31  53  78
4  97  48  36  83  87  91  94  35
5  32  59  45  91  25   6  30  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the intention of minimizing envy, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to ensure that each agent receives items that are collectively of high value to them.

Here's a possible allocation procedure:

1. Consider the highest valued item for each agent and try to allocate it to them, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
2. Balance the remaining items based on the next highest values.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0 seems to value item 3 highly (99).
- Agent 1 has a high value for item 5 (99).
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly as well (99), but agent 1 has been given item 5. So we give agent 2 item 0 (91).
- Agent 3 values item 7 (78).
- Agent 4 values item 0 (97), but agent 0 has been given item 3. So we give agent 4 item 6 (94).
- Agent 5 can take item 7 (94), but agent 3 has been given item 7, so agent 5 gets item 3 (91).

Now, distribute the remaining items to minimize envy:

- Agent 0: Already has item 3, give item 1 (71).
- Agent 1: Already has item 5, give item 4 (86).
- Agent 2: Already has item 0, give item 2 (45).
- Agent 3: Already has item 7, no more items left.
- Agent 4: Already has item 6, no more items left.
- Agent 5: Already has item 3, give item 1 (59).

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items of high value to them and no items are left unallocated.
