Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  46  21  99  36  56   2  65
1  18  28  94  57   7  70   5  29
2  45  75  62   0  11  14  10  47
3  84   6   3  30  24  87  36  14
4  66  56  57   6  99  71  44  70
5  85  54  82  65  57  27  93  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that considers envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels that another agent has received a better allocation based on their individual valuations. A common approach is to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives or to ensure each agent gets at least their fair share of the total valuation.

Let's begin by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 49 + 46 + 21 + 99 + 36 + 56 + 2 + 65 = 374
- Agent 1: 18 + 28 + 94 + 57 + 7 + 70 + 5 + 29 = 308
- Agent 2: 45 + 75 + 62 + 0 + 11 + 14 + 10 + 47 = 264
- Agent 3: 84 + 6 + 3 + 30 + 24 + 87 + 36 + 14 = 284
- Agent 4: 66 + 56 + 57 + 6 + 99 + 71 + 44 + 70 = 469
- Agent 5: 85 + 54 + 82 + 65 + 57 + 27 + 93 + 47 = 510

Now, we attempt to allocate items such that the minimum value received by any agent is maximized, and we ensure no agent feels envious of another:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most (if possible):
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highest (99)
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highest (94)
   - Agent 2 values item 1 highest (75)
   - Agent 3 values item 0 highest (84)
   - Agent 4 values item 4 highest (99)
   - Agent 5 values item 6 highest (93)

At this point, items 5 and 7 remain unallocated. Let's allocate them based on maximizing overall fairness:

- Agent 0 has item 3 and a value of 99. Let's try to improve other agents' allocations.
- Give item 5 to Agent 3 (value 87) to maximize their satisfaction with their second-highest valued item.
- Give item 7 to Agent 4 (value 70), which is their second-highest unallocated item.

Now all items are allocated. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation aims to be envy-free given the constraints, ensuring each agent receives items aligning with their preferences as much as possible.
