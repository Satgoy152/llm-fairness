Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  43  24  62   7  41  54  49
1  82   0  73  43  38  91  60  17
2  87  30  59  77  84   9  64  39
3  77  21   3  51  95  92  97  67
4  65  44  53  91   6   8  91  50
5  11  66  90  97  12  22   1  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, given the items they have received. Additionally, we need to ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Considering the valuations provided, one approach is to use a method similar to the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method. This involves each agent taking turns to pick the item they value the most that hasn't yet been allocated, ideally resulting in a fair distribution.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued item is 3 (value 62).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued item is 5 (value 91).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued item is 0 (value 87).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued item is 6 (value 97).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valued item is 3, but already allocated, so next is 6 (value 91).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valued item is 2 (value 90).

Now, each agent has chosen one item:

- Agent 0 has item 3.
- Agent 1 has item 5.
- Agent 2 has item 0.
- Agent 3 has item 6.
- Agent 4 has item 1.
- Agent 5 has item 2.

We have 2 items remaining (4 and 7), and we will continue by considering the next highest values for each remaining item:

7. **Agent 0**: Next highest valued item is 7 (value 49).
8. **Agent 1**: Next highest valued item is 4 (value 38).

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that everyone gets at least one item, and the items are distributed in a manner consistent with their highest preferences, given the constraints.
