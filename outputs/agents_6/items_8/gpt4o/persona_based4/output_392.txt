Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  26  17  50  17  53  45  67
1   6  85  47  78  41   9  23  42
2  19  39  20  65  60   7  22  52
3  69   1  43  29  43  24  54  32
4  42  40  50  33  16  79  74  56
5  25  10  21  71  21  67  90  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use an approach that balances individual valuations and attempts to minimize envy. A common method is to iteratively allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and maximizing overall satisfaction.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Step 1**: Identify the highest-valued items for each agent and ensure each agent gets at least one item.
2. **Step 2**: Allocate the remaining items to agents based on maximizing their total value while maintaining fairness.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [94, 26, 17, 50, 17, 53, 45, 67]
Agent 1: [6, 85, 47, 78, 41, 9, 23, 42]
Agent 2: [19, 39, 20, 65, 60, 7, 22, 52]
Agent 3: [69, 1, 43, 29, 43, 24, 54, 32]
Agent 4: [42, 40, 50, 33, 16, 79, 74, 56]
Agent 5: [25, 10, 21, 71, 21, 67, 90, 68]
```

**Initial Allocation**:
- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 94)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 85)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (value 65)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (value 54)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (value 79)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (value 21)

**Remaining Items**: 4, 7

**Allocation of Remaining Items**:
- Item 4: Best for Agent 2 (value 60)
- Item 7: Best for Agent 5 (value 68)

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [3, 4]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [2, 7]

The allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```
