Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  56  32  31  87  87  93  28
1  65  20   7  90  12  86  61  24
2  32  93  61  46  13  32  29  78
3  36  34  92  61   5  54  76  99
4  82  11  28  24  54  53  38  72
5   2   8  58  52  56  81  21  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a manner that aims for envy-freeness, we can use a simple round-robin approach based on the agents' highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item before others get a second item if possible. We also need to consider that each agent should receive an integer number of items, and all 8 items must be allocated.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. Start by identifying the highest value item for each agent.
2. Assign each agent their highest value item sequentially.
3. After each agent has one item, continue assigning the remaining items based on the next highest valuations.

Following this approach:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (93), so allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (90), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (93), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (99), so allocate item 7 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (82), so allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (81), so allocate item 5 to agent 5.

Now, each agent has one item, and two items remain to be allocated (items 2 and 4).

7. The highest remaining value:
   - Agent 2 values item 2 (61) the highest among unallocated items.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
   
8. The next highest remaining value:
   - Agent 5 values item 4 (56) the highest among unallocated items.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 5.

No more items remain to be allocated. This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 4]
}
```
