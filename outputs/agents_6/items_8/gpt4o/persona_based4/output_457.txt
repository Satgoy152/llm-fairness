Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  76  32  71  83  31  94  57
1  30  74  27  36  86   8  18  39
2  20  71  90  97  61  16   0  68
3  97  54  49  36  31  54  33  67
4   7  43  24  28  30  31  57   0
5  86  89  35  88  61  73  23  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents such that the allocation is fair according to the given valuations. The goal is to minimize envy, which means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation.

One common approach to achieve fairness is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion. In this setup, an envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Another concept often used is maximizing the minimum value that an agent receives (also known as the max-min fair allocation).

Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items to maximize fairness. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation:

1. Assign items such that each agent receives items maximizing their individual valuation while ensuring that no agent envies another.

2. Consider the preferences and try to balance the total value each agent perceives they are receiving.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 6 highly, so they will receive these.
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so they will receive this.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly, so they will receive this.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly, but it's already allocated, so they will receive item 7.
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly, but it's already allocated, so they will receive item 5.
- Agent 5 values item 1 highly, so they will receive this.

This allocation ensures each agent receives the items that maximize their valuation, as much as possible, given the constraints.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
