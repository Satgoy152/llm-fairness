Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  71  28  92  77  66  62  69
1  56  52  31  25  21  33  75  26
2  69  61  81  90  86  20  42   1
3  14  23  87  44  18  32  29  67
4  81  34  95  36  58  61  14  55
5  18  38  19  82  40  17  97  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a share that they value highly. This can often be achieved by using various algorithms like the round-robin method, but given the small number of items and agents, a manual analysis can be performed.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 92). Therefore, assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 6 (value 75). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 3 (value 90), but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 2 (value 81). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 2 (value 87), but it's taken, so the next highest is item 7 (value 67). Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 2 (value 95), but it's taken. The next highest is item 0 (value 81). Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is item 7 (value 98), but it's taken. The next highest is item 6 (value 97), but it's taken as well. Then, item 3 (value 82) is already taken, the next highest is item 4 (value 40). Assign item 4 to Agent 5.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value 52) to Agent 1 since Agent 1 values it second highest after 6.

- **Agent 5**: Assign item 5 (value 17) to Agent 5 as it's left unallocated and Agent 5 values it higher than item 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a share that they relatively value highly.
