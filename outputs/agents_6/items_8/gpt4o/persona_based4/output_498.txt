Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  54   4  22  90  56  38  44
1  53  87  66  90  64  70  95  93
2  45  17  78  22  77  86  98  67
3  57   7  11  82  45  99  73  43
4  99  67  95  70  20  52   1  63
5  14  81   6  51  16   3   5  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, especially in cases where the number of items is not a multiple of the number of agents. We will attempt a fair division based on the valuations provided, aiming to approximate envy-freeness as closely as possible.

Here's a strategy we can use:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Sort the agents by their total value, and attempt to allocate items starting with the agent that values the items the most.
3. For each agent, allocate items that are most highly valued by them but not yet allocated.
4. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this approach:

**Step 1: Calculate total value each agent assigns to all items**
- Agent 0: 368
- Agent 1: 518
- Agent 2: 490
- Agent 3: 417
- Agent 4: 467
- Agent 5: 200

**Step 2: Sort agents by total value and attempt allocation**

1. **Agent 1**: Highest value for items 3 (90), 7 (93), 6 (95) - Assigns items [3, 7, 6] to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2**: Next highest value for items 6 (98), 5 (86), 4 (77) - Assigns item [5] to Agent 2 (since 6 is taken).
3. **Agent 4**: Highest value for items 0 (99), 2 (95) - Assigns items [0, 2] to Agent 4.
4. **Agent 0**: Highest value for items 4 (90), 0 (60), 1 (54) - Assigns item [4] to Agent 0 (since 0 is taken).
5. **Agent 3**: Highest value for items 5 (99), 3 (82), 6 (73) - No items left for allocation.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value for items 1 (81) - Assigns item [1] to Agent 5.

**Step 3: Review allocations for remaining items**
- Item 3 is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 7 is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 6 is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 5 is allocated to Agent 2.
- Item 0 is allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 2 is allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 4 is allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 1 is allocated to Agent 5.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 7, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and while it may not achieve perfect envy-freeness, it attempts to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations.
