Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  32  25  90  66  25  51  34
1  40  46  25  66  35  46  11  43
2  74  36  36  30  45   3  22  99
3  31  97  90  42  69  64   7  44
4  54  91  77  35  54   2  39  85
5  45  39  21  92  99   2  70  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation, ideally reaching a state called envy-freeness. In simple terms, each agent should value their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, not every agent will receive an item, but we will try to distribute the items to minimize envy.

Here's a proposed allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation on item 3 (90). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on item 1 (46) and item 5 (46). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation on item 7 (99). Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation on item 1 (97) already taken. Next highest is item 2 (90). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation on item 1 (91) already taken. Next highest is item 7 (85) already taken. Next is item 4 (54). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation on item 4 (99) already taken. Next highest is item 7 (99) already taken. Assign item 5 (70) to Agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 (49) to Agent 0, as it is not yet allocated and has a relatively high value for Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 (51) to Agent 0, as it still maximizes its utility without causing envy.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent gets while considering their preferences, ensuring a fair distribution of items.
