Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  43  32   4  94  13  40  96
1  96  75  21  20  35  46  31  22
2  82  16  52  93  53   9  29   1
3  23  25  41  67  65  86  15  53
4  67  70  16  16  40  55  48  34
5  93   1  94  28  81  95  77  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. Envy-freeness is a desirable property where each agent feels they received at least as much value as any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Given the matrix of valuations, we will attempt to balance total valuations across agents as much as possible. One approach is to iteratively assign the most valued unallocated item to the agent who values it the most, provided it doesn't lead to excessive imbalance in the total value received by each agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Most valued item: 7 (value: 96)
   - Assign item 7

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Most valued item: 0 (value: 96)
   - Assign item 0

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Most valued item: 3 (value: 93)
   - Assign item 3

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Most valued item: 5 (value: 86)
   - Assign item 5

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Most valued item: 1 (value: 70)
   - Assign item 1

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Most valued item: 2 (value: 94)
   - Assign item 2

At this point, each agent has one item. We have two remaining items to allocate: 4 and 6.

7. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 4: 
     - Highest valuation by Agent 0 (value: 94)
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 0

   - Item 6:
     - Highest valuation by Agent 5 (value: 77)
     - Assign item 6 to Agent 5

The final allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, while attempting to minimize total envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```
