Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  26  29  97  80  96  61   4
1  77   1  69  91  79  19  41  27
2  21  75  99  69  60  53  49   7
3  55  93  49  72  24  45  20  93
4  57  71  21  41  36  91  99  88
5  48  22  67  78  75  40  21  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive. Given that each agent might value the items differently, a common approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items to maximize fairness:

Agent 0:
- Highest value items: 3 (97), 5 (96)

Agent 1:
- Highest value items: 0 (77), 3 (91)

Agent 2:
- Highest value items: 2 (99), 1 (75)

Agent 3:
- Highest value items: 1 (93), 7 (93)

Agent 4:
- Highest value items: 6 (99), 7 (88)

Agent 5:
- Highest value items: 3 (78), 4 (75)

Given this, we try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

A reasonable allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [3, 5]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [2, 1]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [4]

This allocation respects the condition that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. It's an attempt to balance the highest possible satisfaction among the agents.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
