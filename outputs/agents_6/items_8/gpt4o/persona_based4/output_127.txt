Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  43   5  34  80  22  33  90
1  58  19  22   3  85  10  81  48
2  92  58  45  35  73  18  70  30
3  46  77  79  71  55  11  23   5
4  67  52  87  23  27  31  18  34
5  72  84   7  87  86  11  75  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a solution that minimizes envy and distributes the items such that the agents' valuations are balanced as much as possible. Given the small number of agents and items, a manual inspection and allocation can achieve a fair division.

Let's consider the following approach to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 0 (90). This is a significant outlier in terms of value, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1 (85). We allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 2 (92). We allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 3 (79). We allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Item 2 is highly valued by Agent 4 as well, but it's already allocated to Agent 3. Therefore, we look for the next best item for Agent 4. Item 4 has a moderate value (27), but item 3 has a slightly better value (23) and is not yet allocated. Allocating item 3 to Agent 4 seems reasonable based on remaining choices.

6. **Agent 5**: Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 5 (84). We allocate item 1 to Agent 5.

Now we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items, ensuring a fair distribution:

7. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 5 at 22, which is next in line of interests not yet allocated. We allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 2**: Item 6 has a moderate value for Agent 2 (70), and since Agent 2 already has a high-value item, distributing a moderate value item is fair. We allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocation is complete, ensuring each agent has received items, and we have distributed all 8 items.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1]
}
```
