Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  40  69  40  99   6   9  64
1  76  44  58  88  44  91  11  40
2  66  76  14  32   0  34  48  54
3  11  32  13  30  23  31  47  69
4  79  40  54  36  20  35  48   7
5  71  78  86  22  72  56  55  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[69 40 69 40 99  6  9 64]
 [76 44 58 88 44 91 11 40]
 [66 76 14 32  0 34 48 54]

 [79 40 54 36 20 35 48  7]
 [71 78 86 22 72 56 55 52]]
Output:
To allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents fairly, we aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible, given the discrete and integer nature of the items and the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items.

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0: 396
   - Agent 1: 452
   - Agent 2: 324
   - Agent 3: 256
   - Agent 4: 319
   - Agent 5: 492

2. **Determine Fair Share:**
   - Since there are 8 items, ideally each agent should get around \( \frac{8}{6} \approx 1.33 \) items. However, this isn't possible with integer allocations, so we seek a balanced approach.

3. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest total valuation, so we start by assigning items that maximize their satisfaction.
   - Agent 5 has the second highest total valuation, so we continue with them next.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Prioritize items that are valued highly by each agent while ensuring that no agent is overly envious.

5. **Allocate Items:**
   - Allocate based on descending order of individual item valuations for each agent, ensuring no more than 8 items are assigned in total.

Here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [3, 5]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [4, 6]

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution while maximizing the respective valuations of the items for each agent. 

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```
