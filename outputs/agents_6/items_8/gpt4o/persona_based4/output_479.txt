Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  95  22  49  76  97  73  79
1  55  36  57  87  15  96  21  53
2   5  90  39  98  79  73  78  37
3   2  22  65  23  34  57  59  28
4  78  31  93  41   4   6  36   0
5  16   6  82  57  18   2  41  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can utilize a well-known fair division method such as the "Envy-Free" allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own. Given the agents' valuations, let's attempt to allocate the items so that the distribution is as envy-free as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Initial Consideration**: Begin by examining the highest valued items for each agent and try to assign them to ensure maximum satisfaction.
2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Adjust allocations to reduce envy where possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 1 and 5.
- **Agent 1** highly values items 3 and 5.
- **Agent 2** highly values items 3 and 6.
- **Agent 3** highly values items 2 and 5.
- **Agent 4** highly values items 2 and 0.
- **Agent 5** highly values items 2 and 7.

Based on these considerations, we attempt to allocate items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (highest value for agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (high value, with respect to other preferences).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (high value, reduces potential envy).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 6 (a high-value item not strongly contested by others).
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 0 (good value for agent 4).
6. **Agent 5**: Assign item 2 and item 7 (balances their preference and availability).

Now, let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items while maintaining an envy-free perspective as much as possible given the constraints.
