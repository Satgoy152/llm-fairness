Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  39  97  92  70  60  54   0
1   9  84  86  86  87  96  54  18
2  87  28  65  85  35  45  28  87
3  49  47  62  70   1  68  78  32
4  19  30  65  18  39  77  18  44
5   6  41  66  43  38  54   9  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method such as the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach or a similar computational method designed for fair division. The goal is to maximize the product of the agents' utilities.

Let's proceed with the allocation by examining the agents' preferences and trying to balance the utilities:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 2 (97) and item 3 (92).
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 5 (96) and 4 (87).
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0 (87) and 7 (87).
4. **Agent 3** has a relatively high valuation for item 6 (78) and item 3 (70).
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 (77) the most.
6. **Agent 5** values item 7 (78) the most.

Based on these preferences, plus the need to ensure each agent gets some items without exceeding the total number of available items, here's a fair allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 0 and 7 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 5.

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's highest values while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1]
}
```
