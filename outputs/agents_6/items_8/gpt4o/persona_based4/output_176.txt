Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12   1  45  93  68  88  57  99
1  42  92  81  53  55  47   0  78
2  41  53  93  19  34  71  53  21
3  63  55  99  70  37  69  66  32
4  88  79  24  41  72  42  36  97
5  18   2  68  82  46  22  17  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible based on their valuations. A common method to achieve this is using the "maximin share" approach, which tries to ensure that each agent gets at least as much value as they would if they were to divide the items themselves.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Determine the total valuation for each agent if they received all items.

2. **Estimate Fair Share**: Divide each agent's total valuation by the number of agents to determine a fair share value.

3. **Allocate Items**: Iteratively allocate items to agents to maximize their individual valuations while ensuring that no item is left unassigned.

Let's calculate and allocate accordingly:

- **Agent 0**: Total valuation = 463
- **Agent 1**: Total valuation = 448
- **Agent 2**: Total valuation = 385
- **Agent 3**: Total valuation = 491
- **Agent 4**: Total valuation = 479
- **Agent 5**: Total valuation = 299

Now we aim to allocate items while considering these valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. 

Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [7] (Value = 99)
- **Agent 1**: [1] (Value = 92)
- **Agent 2**: [2] (Value = 93)
- **Agent 3**: [3] (Value = 70)
- **Agent 4**: [0, 4] (Value = 88 + 72 = 160)
- **Agent 5**: [5, 6] (Value = 22 + 17 = 39)

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
