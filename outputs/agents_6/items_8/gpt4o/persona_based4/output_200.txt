Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  38  51  30  88  50  85  80
1   4   9  22  76  13  72  25  75
2  20  84   2  70  10  75   7  62
3   7  28  75  21  85  46  48  42
4  58  86  64  76  94  91  25  94
5  96  52  82  62  91  71  96   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure that the division is as envy-free as possible, we can apply a round-robin allocation method based on maximizing each agent's utility for the items. This method attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items according to their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 0 (96), so assign item 0 to Agent 5.
2. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest (94), so assign item 4 to Agent 4.
3. **Agent 0** values item 6 the highest (85), so assign item 6 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest (75), so assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (76), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest (75), so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Going back to Agent 5**, assign item 1 to Agent 5 (52).
8. **Going back to Agent 4**, assign item 7 to Agent 4 (94).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's utility and distribute the items fairly:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```
