Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  81  99  41  56   8  48   1
1  47  55  23  84  59  25  45  61
2  79  83  71  66  30  66  13   5
3  53  37  11  19  56   1   5  35
4  63  15  23  14  34  37  11  56
5  31  46  64  22  56  20  83  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that respects envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocations. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent values their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Let's begin by considering each agent's valuations and try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction.

First, let's sort the items by each agent's valuation to see who values which items the most:

- Agent 0: [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 0, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: [3, 4, 7, 0, 1, 6, 5, 2]
- Agent 2: [1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7]
- Agent 3: [0, 4, 1, 7, 3, 2, 6, 5]
- Agent 4: [0, 7, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 6]
- Agent 5: [6, 2, 7, 1, 4, 0, 3, 5]

Next, we will allocate items by considering these preferences, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and we distribute all 8 items.

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
5. Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (second highest value for Agent 4).
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (highest value for Agent 5).

Now, we have 2 items left (4 and 5), and each agent already has one item. Let's distribute these based on remaining preferences and to balance the envy:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (second highest remaining preference).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest preference).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
