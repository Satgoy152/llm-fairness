Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  27  18  55  29  93  87  12
1  65  29   4  75  95   7  23   7
2  64  23  90  76  93  37  73  97
3  69  78  85  93  16  27  97  88
4   0  25  94  29  58  41  79  78
5  16  73  51  91  74   6  39  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations given by each agent for the items and try to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their preferences. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 3 (both valued at 55). 
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (valued at 95).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 7 (valued at 97).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 6 (valued at 97).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 2 (valued at 94).
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 3 (valued at 91), but it is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 1 (valued at 73).

Since each agent has a strong preference for at least one item, we try to give each agent at least one item they value highly:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- Since Agent 0 values item 3 as much as item 0, assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as they value it relatively higher compared to other unallocated items.

This allocation results in the following distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 5, 7
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 1

This allocation tries to respect each agent's preferences and ensures each agent receives at least one item they value highly, aiming for a fair and envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
