Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  63  65  20  88  85  52  48
1  39  10  80  56  77  83  81  51
2  82  78  78  21  38  13  63  62
3  34  59   6  48   9  81  29  19
4   5  48  37  80  48  84  27  85
5  20  62  31  28  25  75  94  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a fair manner, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations, we'll focus on a balanced approach that maximizes fairness based on the agents' valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 7.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 6, but it's already claimed by Agent 1, so the next best is item 0, already claimed by Agent 2. We look for an alternative.

Let's allocate the highest value items first, one per agent, if possible:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 7
- Agent 5: Item 2 (next best after item 0, which is taken)

Now we have 8 items in total, and 6 have been allocated. We still need to allocate items 1 and 3. We'll allocate them to the agents who might be least satisfied with their current allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (next best available)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (next best available)

Thus the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
