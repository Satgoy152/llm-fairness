Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  95  35  77  74  47  81   6
1  20  62  57  53  17  14  55   8
2  42  10  18  45  57  95  66   1
3  68  80  75  81  80  53   7  39
4  77   8  86  38  39  74  70  57
5  19  26   2  22  34  30  14  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that adheres to the principles of envy-freeness, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the constraints, the allocation process will involve balancing the total value received by each agent.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has a strong preference for item 1 (95) and item 6 (81). Allocating these items to agent 0 allows us to satisfy a substantial portion of their total valuation.

2. **Agent 1** has a moderate preference for item 2 (57), which is significantly higher than other values for this agent. We will allocate item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** highly values item 5 (95). Assigning item 5 to agent 2 addresses a large part of their total preference.

4. **Agent 3** has a balanced preference across several items but values item 3 (81) and item 4 (80) quite highly. We will allocate these items to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** shows a strong preference for item 4 (39) and item 6 (70), but since item 4 is already allocated to agent 3, we will allocate item 0 (77) and item 6 (70) to agent 4, matching their next highest preferences.

6. **Agent 5** has generally lower valuations. We will allocate the remaining items, which are item 7 (17), to agent 5.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences, and the total number of items allocated matches the requirement.
