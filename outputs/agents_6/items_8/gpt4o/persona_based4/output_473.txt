Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  40  32  67  91  60  74  92
1  60  15  34  43  23  15  84  84
2   8  40  81  92  79  13  38  51
3  34  61  95  94  24  35  13  31
4  57  51  13  22  77  59  30  50
5   2  84  69  97  57   0  48  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will employ an envy-free approach. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations, we will attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items maximizing their valuation while minimizing envy.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item Across All Agents**: This gives us an idea of each item's overall desirability.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign items to agents based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one high-value item.

3. **Adjustments for Envy-Freeness**: Adjust allocations to minimize envy, ensuring that no agent feels another has a better allocation according to their preferences.

Let's go through this process:

1. **Total Value for Each Item**:
   - Item 0: 74 + 60 + 8 + 34 + 57 + 2 = 235
   - Item 1: 40 + 15 + 40 + 61 + 51 + 84 = 291
   - Item 2: 32 + 34 + 81 + 95 + 13 + 69 = 324
   - Item 3: 67 + 43 + 92 + 94 + 22 + 97 = 415
   - Item 4: 91 + 23 + 79 + 24 + 77 + 57 = 351
   - Item 5: 60 + 15 + 13 + 35 + 59 + 0 = 182
   - Item 6: 74 + 84 + 38 + 13 + 30 + 48 = 287
   - Item 7: 92 + 84 + 51 + 31 + 50 + 49 = 357

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Individual Valuation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (74)
   - Item 1: Agent 5 (84)
   - Item 2: Agent 3 (95)
   - Item 3: Agent 5 (97)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (91)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (60)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (84)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (92)

3. **Adjustments for Envy-Freeness**:
   - Reassign some items to ensure more balanced allocations:
     - Item 0: Move to Agent 1 (60) 
     - Item 4: Assign to Agent 4 (77) 
     - Item 5: Assign to Agent 2 (13)

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 7
   - Agent 1: Item 0, Item 6
   - Agent 2: Item 5
   - Agent 3: Item 2
   - Agent 4: Item 4
   - Agent 5: Item 1, Item 3

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, taking into account their valuations and distributing items to minimize envy and maximize fairness.
