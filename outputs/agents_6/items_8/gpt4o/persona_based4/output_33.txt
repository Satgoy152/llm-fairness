Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80   5   3  55  87  52  11  29
1  26  65  22  21   6   2   1  75
2  49   1  92  76  70  53  39  11
3  49  35  72  63  80  43  26  11
4  56  91  21  75  58  32  20  57
5  39  15  58  32  25  23   1  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to achieve envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations. In this scenario, we have 6 agents and 8 items, so some agents will receive more items than others.

Given these constraints and the valuations provided, let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highest (87), followed by item 0 (80). We'll allocate item 0 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 7 highest (75), followed by item 1 (65). We'll allocate item 7 and 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highest (92). We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 highest (80) which is already allocated, so next highest is item 2, followed by item 3 and item 6. We'll allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 highest (91), which is already allocated. Next, item 3 is valued at 75 but already allocated. Item 7 is valued at 57. We'll allocate item 5 to Agent 4 as it is available.

6. **Agent 5**: Values item 2 highest (58), which is already allocated. Next, item 0 is valued at 39, which is already allocated. We'll allocate item 6 to Agent 5.

After this process, all items are allocated, and each agent has received at least one item, or has been considered for allocation.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring all items are distributed.
