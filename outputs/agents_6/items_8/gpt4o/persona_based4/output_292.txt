Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  69  83  18  54  35  16  11
1  44  88  33  72  57  13  63  93
2  65  83   4  13  46  45  82  87
3  88  27  81  24  18  50  75  31
4  53  24  20  54  63  67  33  31
5  90  97  57  37  26  60  71   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation, based on their own valuations.

Given the data, let's follow a process to allocate items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item**: Sum the valuations of each item across all agents to get a sense of overall desirability.

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations. This approach attempts to reduce envy by ensuring agents receive items they value highly.

3. **Check for Completeness**: Ensure every item is allocated and no agent is assigned more than their fair share based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by agent 5 (90), allocate to agent 5.
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by agent 5 (97), allocate to agent 5.
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (83), allocate to agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by agent 1 (72), allocate to agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by agent 4 (63), allocate to agent 4.
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by agent 4 (67), allocate to agent 4.
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by agent 3 (75), allocate to agent 3.
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation by agent 1 (93), allocate to agent 1.

### Final Allocations:
Now, let's represent the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with every agent either receiving items they highly value or none if their highest valuations were outmatched by others.
