Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  88  34  95  15  25  16  88
1  47  77  44   5  98  11  48  67
2  26  55  63  77  97  53  61  38
3   2  42  49  33   4  68  28  40
4  81  37  28  33  31   0  46  61
5  46  43  84  43  49  94   3  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize fairness and minimize envy among agents. One such method is the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy an agent feels about another agent's allocation can be removed by removing at most one item from the other agent's allocation.

Given that we have 6 agents and 8 items, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.** This will give us an idea of their overall preference.
2. **Sort agents based on their total valuation of items.** Agents with higher valuations will be considered first for allocation.
3. **Allocate items to agents iteratively while maintaining fairness by ensuring no agent feels significantly envious of another's allocation.**

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 73 + 88 + 34 + 95 + 15 + 25 + 16 + 88 = 434
- Agent 1: 47 + 77 + 44 + 5 + 98 + 11 + 48 + 67 = 397
- Agent 2: 26 + 55 + 63 + 77 + 97 + 53 + 61 + 38 = 470
- Agent 3: 2 + 42 + 49 + 33 + 4 + 68 + 28 + 40 = 266
- Agent 4: 81 + 37 + 28 + 33 + 31 + 0 + 46 + 61 = 317
- Agent 5: 46 + 43 + 84 + 43 + 49 + 94 + 3 + 75 = 437

Next, we need to consider allocations that allow each agent to have at least one item:

1. **Allocate the highest-valued item each agent desires.**

- Agent 0: Item 3 (95)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (98)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (97) - Already allocated to Agent 1; next highest is Item 3 (77)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (94)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (68) - Already allocated to Agent 5; next highest is Item 2 (49)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (81)

2. **Resolve conflicts and finalize allocations.**

To avoid overlap and ensure all items are allocated, iterate and adjust allocations to achieve EF1:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Items 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6
- Agent 3: Items 2
- Agent 4: Items 7
- Agent 5: Items 5

This allocation aims to distribute items as fairly as possible based on the initial preferences.

Finally, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
