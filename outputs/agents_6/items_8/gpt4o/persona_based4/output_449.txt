Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  33  20  32  67  97  32  63
1  28  10  75  25  10  97  86  76
2  60  22   3  58  22  30  20  75
3  11  68  12  23  32  44  41  57
4  16  19  43  15  26  84  23  72
5  73  65  63  41   2  17  62  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items according to some fairness criteria. Since the goal is to create an envy-free allocation, we will aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, given their valuations.

To accomplish this, we can utilize the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for their allocated items while attempting to minimize envy. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose the items that Agent 0 values highly. We can start by giving them item 5 (value 97) and item 4 (value 67).
   
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 5 (value 97) and item 6 (value 86). Since item 5 is already allocated to Agent 0, we give them item 6 and item 7 (value 76).

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 7 highly (value 75) and item 0 (value 60). Give them item 0.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 1 (value 68) and item 7 (value 57). Allocate item 1 to them.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 5 highly (value 84), but it is already taken. Allocate item 2 (value 43).

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 0 (value 73), but it is already taken. Allocate items 3 (value 41) and item 2 (value 63).

To ensure all items are allocated and no agent is left out, we adjust as follows:

- **Agent 0**: [5, 4]
- **Agent 1**: [6, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 3]
- **Agent 3**: [1]
- **Agent 4**: [2]
- **Agent 5**: []

Checking the allocation:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are allocated.
- Each agent is allocated at least one item where possible.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items while considering their valuations, thereby trying to minimize envy.
