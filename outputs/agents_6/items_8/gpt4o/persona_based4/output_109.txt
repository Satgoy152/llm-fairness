Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  29  70  85  28   4  96  14
1  97  13  26  67  99  19  66  65
2  30  86   8  39  83  53  98  15
3  38  12  23  87  87  15  29  33
4  93  44  66  62  22  63  35  73
5  20   7  97  32  23  23  64  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while respecting their preferences, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. The goal is to allocate items such that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

To do this, we can follow a method similar to the "round-robin" method, where each agent takes turns selecting their most valued remaining item until all items are allocated. This helps in maintaining fairness by giving each agent an equal opportunity to choose their preferred items sequentially.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Round 1:**

   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most (value 96), so they get item 6.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 99), so they get item 4.
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the most (value 98), but it's already taken, so they choose item 1 (value 86).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 and 4 equally (value 87), but item 4 is taken, so they get item 3.
   - Agent 4 values item 0 the most (value 93), so they get item 0.
   - Agent 5 values item 2 the most (value 97), so they get item 2.

2. **Round 2:**

   - Remaining items: 5, 7.
   - Agent 0 selects item 7 (value 14).
   - Agent 1 selects item 5 (value 19).

All items are now allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```
