Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  50  71   0  87  91  49  59
1  55  16  23  66  95  40  98  79
2  71  75  31  69  12  52  46  36
3  79  54   1   3  36  63  42  74
4  13  86  11  65  78  15  82  83
5  67  95  33  70  13  55  50  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we can use a variety of methods. One approach is to use a round-robin or bidding mechanism, but for simplicity, let's try a direct allocation based on maximizing each agent's overall satisfaction while attempting to balance total value across agents.

Given the valuations, we can aim to distribute items such that the sum of values each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here is a proposed allocation, considering both maximizing individual satisfaction and balancing total value:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high value for item 4 (87), item 5 (91), and item 0 (75). Allocating item 5 to Agent 0 gives them high value.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high value for item 4 (95) and item 6 (98). Allocating item 6 to Agent 1 gives them high value.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 1 (75). Allocating item 1 to Agent 2 provides good value.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 (79) and item 7 (74). Allocating item 7 to Agent 3 gives them value.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 7 (83) and item 1 (86). Allocating item 4 to Agent 4 provides balance.
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 1 (95) and item 3 (70). Allocating item 3 to Agent 5 provides good value.

This allocation aims to balance the total values received by each agent, given their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are fairly distributed among the agents, attempting to maximize individual satisfaction and balance overall value. Agent 5 receives more items to balance their lower individual item values.
