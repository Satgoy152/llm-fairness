Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23   3  16  85  87  27  10  85
1  53  73  25  22  91  12  97  93
2  42  57  85  50   7  75  27  77
3  86  54  60  28  57  31  11  39
4  26  13  26  19  80   6  26  88
5  29  20  72   3  90  88   7  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution. MNW maximizes the product of the utilities of the agents, providing a balance between efficiency and fairness.

Here's an attempt to allocate the items as fairly as possible based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Highest valuations: Items 3 (85), 7 (85)
   - Allocation: [3, 7]
   
2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Highest valuations: Items 4 (91), 6 (97)
   - Allocation: [4, 6]
   
3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Highest valuations: Items 2 (85), 5 (75)
   - Allocation: [2, 5]
   
4. **Agent 3:**  
   - Highest valuations: Items 0 (86)
   - Allocation: [0]
   
5. **Agent 4:**  
   - Highest valuations: Items 7 (88), 4 (80)
   - Allocation: []
   - Note: Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 7, but it is already allocated. Items 4 and 7 are highly valued by other agents as well.
   
6. **Agent 5:**  
   - Highest valuations: Items 5 (88), 4 (90)
   - Allocation: [1]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the highest valuations across different agents to reduce envy and ensure that each agent receives items with high personal value where possible. However, it's important to note that achieving perfect envy-freeness is not always possible, especially with a limited number of items and varying valuations.
