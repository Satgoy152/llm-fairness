Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68   3  56  56  84  66   1  39
1  71  43  38   0  32  17  10  99
2   8  12  25  34  58  86  64  95
3  12  55   7  87  75  60  53  75
4  72  44  15  67  24  20  71  15
5  70  29  78  68  93   9   0  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we'll use a simple heuristic approach. We'll aim to distribute items in a way that each agent receives items they value highly, and try to balance the total value each agent receives. 

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** Compute the total value each agent assigns to all items. This helps in understanding which agents value the items the most.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than the fair share of items to start.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If some agents receive fewer items, redistribute items with the lowest difference in value between the current holder and the under-allocated agent.

Let's perform the allocation:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 (Value = 71)
- **Item 1:** Agent 3 (Value = 55)
- **Item 2:** Agent 5 (Value = 78)
- **Item 3:** Agent 3 (Value = 87)
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 (Value = 84)
- **Item 5:** Agent 2 (Value = 86)
- **Item 6:** Agent 4 (Value = 71)
- **Item 7:** Agent 1 (Value = 99)

### Step 2: Fairness Adjustment

The distribution above results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 7]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [1, 3]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [2]

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is fairly balanced based on the initial valuations.

### JSON Allocation

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, with a reasonable distribution of total item count.
