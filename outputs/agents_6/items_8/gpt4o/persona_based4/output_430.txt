Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  24  22  67  53   4   9  11
1  48  85  13  89  65  95  15  20
2  77  94  10  81  11  99  18  29
3   2  73  55  29  46  76  76   7
4  29  44  25   2  10  41   8  62
5  53  42  72  81  40  86  99  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, meaning each agent should prefer their own bundle of items over the bundles allocated to other agents, based on their individual valuations. Given the constraints and the need to allocate exactly 8 items among 6 agents, a fair division can be challenging, but we will aim for a balanced approach.

First, let's consider the total valuations for each agent by summing up their valuations for all items:

- Agent 0: 4 + 24 + 22 + 67 + 53 + 4 + 9 + 11 = 194
- Agent 1: 48 + 85 + 13 + 89 + 65 + 95 + 15 + 20 = 430
- Agent 2: 77 + 94 + 10 + 81 + 11 + 99 + 18 + 29 = 419
- Agent 3: 2 + 73 + 55 + 29 + 46 + 76 + 76 + 7 = 364
- Agent 4: 29 + 44 + 25 + 2 + 10 + 41 + 8 + 62 = 221
- Agent 5: 53 + 42 + 72 + 81 + 40 + 86 + 99 + 37 = 510

Next, we will try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total valuation, which is the sum of their individual valuations. This approach helps in achieving a fair division.

One possible allocation is as follows:

1. Agent 1 has a very high valuation for items 3 and 5, so we allocate those to them.
2. Agent 2 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to them.
3. Agent 3 has relatively high valuations for items 5 and 6, but item 6 is the highest for Agent 5, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 5 and item 5 to Agent 3.
4. Agent 0 values item 3 fairly high, but since it's already allocated, we can allocate item 0 to them.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 relatively high, so we allocate item 7 to them.
6. For the remaining items, we consider the next highest valuations for each agent, ensuring everyone gets at least one item if possible.

After carefully considering and balancing the allocations, we arrive at the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with some agents potentially having more than one item due to their higher total valuation or specific high valuations for certain items.
