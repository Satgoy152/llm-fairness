Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  72  67  46  36  47  75  41
1  38  74  53  22  18   7  26  90
2  18  85  42  30  47  57  13  41
3  80   8  22  70   4  52  28  72
4  41  12  69  76  77  69  62   0
5  11   3  30  84   6  95  72  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the fair division problem with the given valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, ensuring each agent receives a set of items that they value highly relative to other agents.

Given the constraint that only eight items can be allocated and each agent should be included in the final allocation (even if they receive no items), we need to carefully consider the valuations to achieve a fair distribution. Here's one approach to solve this:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents who value them the most**: This strategy will help minimize envy since agents will receive items they value highly.

2. **Consider the total value each agent receives**: Try to balance the total valuations across agents to ensure fairness in terms of perceived value.

Here is a potential allocation based on the provided values:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (98), and no other agent values it higher than 80.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most (90), and no other agent values it higher than 72.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (85), and no other agent values it higher than 74.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (70), and no other agent values it higher than 46.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (77), and no other agent values it higher than 36.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most (95), and no other agent values it higher than 69.

For the remaining items (2 and 6), we can balance based on remaining valuations:
- Agent 4 also values item 2 highly (69), and no other agent values it higher than 67.
- Agent 0 values item 6 highly (75), and no other agent values it higher than 72.

Thus, a possible allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, minimizing envy and balancing the overall perceived value.
