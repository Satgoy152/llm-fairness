Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  26  91  27  41  90  97  66
1  51  82  57  95   5  67   7  84
2  11  62  28  42  87  22  12  30
3  45  65  33  94  30   0  63  18
4  84  32  45  30  36  12  75  38
5  73  15  66  83  77  10   0  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value one agent receives, while ensuring envy-freeness as best as possible. Given the constraint that each agent can only receive a whole number of items and there are 8 items, let's proceed with a heuristic approach to allocate the items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the most valued items per agent**: Each agent should ideally receive items that they value the most.

2. **Iterate to distribute items**: We ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while also ensuring the total number of items distributed is exactly 8.

3. **Adjust to ensure envy-freeness**: Review the allocation to minimize envy among agents.

Let's work through the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 6 highly (97), so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 3 highly (95), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 highly (87), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly, but it's taken, so allocate item 1 (65), their next best item, to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 0 highly (84), so allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
- **Agent 5**: Values item 7 highly (98), so allocate item 7 to Agent 5.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (items 2 and 5):

- **Agent 0**: Still has high valuations for item 2 (91).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 5 (67) after their top choice is taken.

This results in the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's valuations and aims to distribute items in a manner that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness.
