Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  33   9  78  12  23  53  51
1  74   2  74  17  46  27  70  46
2  77  95  35  41  36  59  63   0
3  17  94  19  83  71  61  24  42
4  72   2  87  73  79   1   8  11
5  89  73   9  46  74  38  78  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, considering envy-freeness and fair division, we can use a method that tries to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Since there are 6 agents and 8 items, some agents will necessarily receive more items than others. However, we aim for a distribution where each agent feels they have received their fair share based on their preferences.

One possible approach is to assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual satisfaction or utility, according to their valuations, while maintaining fairness.

Let's proceed with this methodology and determine a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation on item 0 (82) and item 3 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on item 2 (74) and item 6 (70).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation on item 1 (95) and item 5 (59).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation on item 3 (83) and item 1 (94).
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation on item 2 (87) and item 4 (79).
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation on item 0 (89) and item 6 (78).

Let's allocate based on these high valuations, ensuring each item is assigned once:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 5 (89) as it is the highest valuation.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (95) as it is the highest valuation.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (87) as it is the highest valuation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (83) as it is the highest valuation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (79) as it is the highest valuation.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (59) as it is one of the higher valuations.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (70) as it is the highest valuation.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (51) as it provides a reasonable distribution.

Now, let's check the allocation for fairness:

- Agent 0 receives item 7.
- Agent 1 receives item 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 5 receives item 0.

This allocation strives to be envy-free as much as possible given the constraints. Now, let's express this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
