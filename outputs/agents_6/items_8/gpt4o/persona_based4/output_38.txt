Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  80  37  99  22  99  86  86
1  14  71  79  46   2  30  40  81
2  13  40  48  90  81  68  79  83
3  92  72  30  92  81  89  22  63
4  39  88   3  21  25  44  12  25
5  25  63  47  71  79  82  81  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. One common approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation strategy, where we try to minimize the maximum envy across all agents. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in every situation, especially with diverse valuations, we aim for a practical compromise.

Here's a possible allocation plan:

1. **Sort items by total valuation**: We can start by sorting the items based on their total valuation across all agents, which can give us an idea of their overall desirability.

2. **Allocate items to minimize envy**: We'll distribute items in a way that attempts to balance the perceived fairness from each agent's perspective, considering their valuations.

3. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items**: With 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we strive to allocate them in a balanced manner.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 5, Item 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 1, Item 7
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Item 0
- **Agent 4**: Item 4
- **Agent 5**: Item 2

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations such that each agent receives items they value reasonably well, while ensuring all items are allocated.
