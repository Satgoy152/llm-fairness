Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  70  62  93  51  89   3  68
1   0   9   4  94  39  94   6  60
2  41  42  13  75  40  25  48  24
3  50   2  93  84  82  32  89  18
4  16  58  46  75  76  89  86  88
5  23  83   2  34  94  65  49  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's preferences and the overall goal of balancing the perceived value of the allocations. Since we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Here's an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 3, so it makes sense to allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3 and item 5 equally, but since item 3 is taken, allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the most, but since it's taken, item 1 is the next highest valued. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the most, so allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 5, which is taken, so allocate item 7 to Agent 4, which is also highly valued.
6. **Agent 5**: Highly values item 4, so allocate item 4 to Agent 5.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items while maintaining a balance:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 3, which is valued at 93. Add item 0, which is also highly valued for Agent 0.
  
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 5, valued at 94. Add item 6, which is the highest remaining value for Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: Already has item 1, valued at 42. No additional items available that maximize fairness.

- **Agent 3**: Already has item 2, valued at 93. No additional items available that maximize fairness.

- **Agent 4**: Already has item 7, valued at 88. No additional items available that maximize fairness.

- **Agent 5**: Already has item 4, valued at 94. No additional items available that maximize fairness.

Now let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent the items they value the most, balancing the total perceived utility across agents.
