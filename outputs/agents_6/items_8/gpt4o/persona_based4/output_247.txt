Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  55  94  73  13  19  55  28
1  53  15  92  79  77  44  23  28
2  70   3  31  81  21  59  16  60
3  11  97  90  68  47  82  29  16
4  56  24  46  21  12  24  23  22
5  23  32  45  82  59  97  47   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 6 agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we can use the "round-robin" method. This method involves each agent taking turns to pick their most preferred item, continuing until all items are allocated. This approach helps in reducing envy among agents as each has the opportunity to select based on their preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

**Step 1**: Determine the most preferred item for each agent and allocate it.

1. Agent 0 values item 2 (value 94) the most.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 (value 92) the most, but it's already taken, so next is item 3 (value 79).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 (value 81) the most, but it's already taken, so next is item 0 (value 70).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 (value 97) the most.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 (value 56) the most, but it's already taken, so next is item 2 (value 46).
6. Agent 5 values item 5 (value 97) the most.

**Step 2**: Allocate remaining items using the next highest available preference for each agent.

- Items allocated so far: [2, 3, 0, 1, 5]
- Remaining items: [4, 6, 7]

1. Agent 0: Already has item 2, next preference is item 3, but it's taken. Next is item 1 (value 55), but it's taken. Next is item 6 (value 55).
2. Agent 1: Already has item 3, next preference is item 4 (value 77).
3. Agent 2: Already has item 0, next preference is item 5, but it's taken. Next is item 1 (value 3), but it's taken. Next preference is item 6 (value 16), but it's taken. Next is item 7 (value 60).
4. Agent 3: Already has item 1, next is item 2, but it's taken. Next is item 5 (value 82), but it's taken. Next is item 3, but it's taken. Next is item 0 (value 11), but it's taken. Next preference is item 7 (value 16), but it's taken. No further preference for available items.
5. Agent 4: Already has item 2, next is item 1, but it's taken. Next is item 3, but it's taken. Next is item 5, but it's taken. Next is item 0, but it's taken. Next is item 6 (value 23), but it's taken. Next is item 7 (value 22).
6. Agent 5: Already has item 5, next is item 3, but it's taken. Next is item 6 (value 47), but it's taken. Next is item 2, but it's taken. Next is item 4 (value 59).

**Final Allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```
This allocation ensures all items are distributed with each agent getting a fair chance based on preference, while keeping the process as envy-free as possible within the constraints.
