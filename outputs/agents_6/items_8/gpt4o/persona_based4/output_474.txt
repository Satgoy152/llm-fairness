Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  25   0  40  69  53  83  91
1  13  24  54  74  70   5  13  55
2  80  20  13  80  17   5   4  73
3  31  45  69  41  69  99   2  99
4  37  89  17  28  85  39  78  77
5  25  55  80   4  75  41  49  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. This typically means each agent should feel that they are getting the best possible share according to their own valuations.

One potential method to achieve a fair allocation is to use a procedure that considers each agent's highest-valued items and iteratively assigns items while balancing fairness.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 7, 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 and 2 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0, 3, and 7 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 and 7 highly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 and 4 highly.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 and 4 highly.

We will allocate items in a way that tries to respect these high valuations while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share. Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 6 to **Agent 0**.
- Assign items 3 and 2 to **Agent 1**.
- Assign item 7 to **Agent 3**.
- Assign item 1 to **Agent 4**.
- Assign item 4 to **Agent 5**.
- Assign item 5 to **Agent 3** (since Agent 3 also values this highly).

This allocation respects each agent's high valuations as much as possible and ensures all items are distributed. Now, let's formalize this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations and ensures that all items are distributed among the agents.
