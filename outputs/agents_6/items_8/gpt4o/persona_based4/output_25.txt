Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  64  51   0  65  20  62   6
1  76  11  63   3  87   3  28  60
2  47  83  68   4  26  16  76   1
3  81  51   1  26  76  34  62  49
4  10  61  12  76  28  97  60  88
5  12  42   4   9  94  15  52  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To tackle the problem of fairly allocating items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach that considers maximizing the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive. However, since we want to ensure a fair division, we must also consider envy-freeness, meaning each agent should feel they received a fair share compared to others.

Given the problem constraints and the need to allocate all items, let's proceed with the allocation process based on the valuations provided:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** First, sum up each agent's valuations to understand their preferences.

2. **Assign Items Based on Valuations:** Start by assigning items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Adjust allocations to prevent any agent from getting disproportionately more valuable items than others, aiming for envy-freeness.

Following this approach, here is one possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 1]
- **Agent 1:** Items [4]
- **Agent 2:** Items [2, 6]
- **Agent 3:** Items [3]
- **Agent 4:** Items [7]
- **Agent 5:** Items [5]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item while attempting to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```
