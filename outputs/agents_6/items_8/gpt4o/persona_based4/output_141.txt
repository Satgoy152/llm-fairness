Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  52  25  35  72  97  93   8
1  75   2  30  71  50  79  71  80
2  79   6  97  37  20  69  98  62
3  46  67  74  58  57  52   2  53
4   7  35  73  79  13  31  63  79
5  25   5  35  40   8  63  32  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the complexity of achieving strict envy-freeness, we will strive for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Hereâ€™s an allocation that attempts to balance the valuations and ensure each agent receives at least one item:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 5, 6, and 0, so we can assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 3 and 7, so we can assign item 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 2 and 6, so we can assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 2, 1, and 3. Since item 2 is already taken, we can assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 3 and 7, so we can assign item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has lower valuations compared to others, so we can assign items 0, 4, and 6 to Agent 5 to balance the allocation.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their valuations for the items they receive.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
