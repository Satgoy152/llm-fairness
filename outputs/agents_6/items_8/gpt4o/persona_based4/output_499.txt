Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  58  87  16  55  17  95  89
1   8  80  95  95  86  99  35  83
2  21  73  90  68  37  49  24  77
3  12  11  50  43   8  53  77  70
4  30  13  39  37  94  96  74  87
5  98  68  74  59  94   8   8  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. The goal is to allocate these items in such a way that no agent envies another based on their own valuation.

Here's one potential approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High Value Preferences**: First, identify which items are highly valued by each agent and try to allocate these items to those agents if possible.
2. **Distribute Equitably**: Ensure each agent receives at least one item where possible, prioritizing the distribution based on the highest valuations.
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: Where multiple agents have high valuations for the same item, consider the distribution of other items to reduce envy.

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to minimize envy:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 7
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 4

This allocation is based on giving each agent at least one item they highly value while considering the overall distribution of items.

Finally, here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on the agents' valuations, aiming for a fair and envy-free outcome.
