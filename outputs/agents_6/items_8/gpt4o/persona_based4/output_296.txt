Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  85  44  94  41  60  37  70
1  82  28  84  16  26  54  15  50
2  99  94  21  46  12  93  73  61
3  52   9  93  16  27  40  77  77
4  57  91  37  94   3   9  21  74
5  81  30   9  55  47  22  12  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the notion of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that they have received a fair proportion of value according to their own valuations. Given that we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Let's proceed with an allocation while considering the fairness and envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (94).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (84).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (99).
4. **Agent 3** has a high value for item 6 (77).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 3 (94), but since it is already assigned, we assign item 1 (91).
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 7 (80).

At this point, each agent has been allocated one item. Now, we need to allocate the remaining 2 items:

7. The remaining items are 4 and 5. 
   - For item 4, Agent 5 has the highest remaining valuation (47).
   - For item 5, Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation (93).

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated and maintaining a sense of fairness.
