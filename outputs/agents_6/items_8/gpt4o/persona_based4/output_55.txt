Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  61  99  45  66  17  76  68
1  88  70  92  59  31  19  70  17
2  93  35  58  64  45  70  97  82
3  11  19  96   1  31  16  91  92
4  67  14  22  93  31  63  45  98
5  28   2  45  54  21  89  45  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents pick items in turns based on their valuations, ensuring that no agent envies another.

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (99)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (87)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (88)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (92)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (97)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (93)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (96)
   - Next highest: Item 7 (92)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 7 (98)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (93)

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (89)
   - Next highest: Item 3 (54)

Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will get more than one item. We can aim for each agent to get at least one item, and then allocate the remaining items based on their valuations.

**Round 1 Allocation:**
- Agent 0 picks Item 2
- Agent 1 picks Item 0
- Agent 2 picks Item 6
- Agent 3 picks Item 7
- Agent 4 picks Item 3
- Agent 5 picks Item 5

**Remaining Items:**
- Item 1, Item 4

**Round 2 Allocation:**
- Agent 0 gets next pick based on remaining high valuation: Item 1
- Agent 4 gets next pick based on remaining high valuation: Item 4

Now, every agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while considering their preferences.
