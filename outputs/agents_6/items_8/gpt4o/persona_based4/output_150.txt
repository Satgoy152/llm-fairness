Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  34  14  43  36  29  50  42
1  53   8  44  74  46  22   6  55
2  53   6  86   9   4  63  79  42
3  48  37  46  61  65  12  91   2
4  80  88  48  54  59  26  46  14
5   8  93  85  57  47  93  65  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness. This is often a challenging problem, especially when each agent has different valuations for each item. However, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's one way to allocate the items, considering each agent's valuation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 1.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation for items 5 and 4.

Let's ensure everyone gets at least one item and try to maximize the total value received by each agent.

Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.
- Agent 5 gets items 4, 5, and 7.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and aims to provide a fair division based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 5, 7]
}
```
