Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  29  23  41  25  58  36  82
1  42   0  25  22  47  15  36  91
2   0  99  88  70  70  99  55  20
3  99   6  13  18  94   7  39   2
4  22  43  54  41  77  14   4   5
5  46  54   1  39  57  54  10  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [46 54  1 39 57 54 10 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while attempting to ensure that each agent receives a fair share, minimizing envy. We aim for an allocation where each agent feels they are receiving a valuable bundle relative to what others receive.

Let's proceed through an allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values item 7 the most at 82.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the most at 91.
   - Agent 2 values items 1 and 5 highly at 99 each.
   - Agent 3 values item 0 greatly at 99.
   - Agent 4 values item 4 at 77.
   - Agent 5 values item 7 the most at 94.

2. **Assign High-Value Items First:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (91) and not Agent 5 (although 94 is higher) to balance allocations later.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items Based on Next Best Valuations:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 highly values item 5 as well, 99).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (41).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (36).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (54).

4. **Verify Allocation:**
   - Each agent should ideally feel they have a share of high-value items.
   - Ensure no agent is left out and that allocations are balanced across agents.

Here's how the allocation looks:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 2],
    "5": []
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation considers high valuations and attempts to balance the perceived fairness among agents.
