Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  66  58  40   6  78  41  26
1   2  98  27  71  92  41  65  82
2  14  41  63  84  75  27  69  11
3  69   8  88  45   4  94  59  75
4  30  78  61  32  28  35  32  57
5  92  60  49  23  77  50  65  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 6 agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility and ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible. Given the valuations, a simple approach is to use a round-robin method based on the agents' highest-valued remaining items, which generally helps in achieving a fair allocation.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 33 + 66 + 58 + 40 + 6 + 78 + 41 + 26 = 348
   - Agent 1: 2 + 98 + 27 + 71 + 92 + 41 + 65 + 82 = 478
   - Agent 2: 14 + 41 + 63 + 84 + 75 + 27 + 69 + 11 = 384
   - Agent 3: 69 + 8 + 88 + 45 + 4 + 94 + 59 + 75 = 442
   - Agent 4: 30 + 78 + 61 + 32 + 28 + 35 + 32 + 57 = 353
   - Agent 5: 92 + 60 + 49 + 23 + 77 + 50 + 65 + 55 = 471

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Sort each agent's valuations for items in descending order.
   - Use a round-robin selection starting with the agent with the highest total value, ensuring all agents get a chance to pick their most valued remaining item.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Following this strategy, allocate items based on the highest individual item value remaining for each agent in rotation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5, which they value highest.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4, their top choices.
- Agent 2 gets item 3, highly valued by them.
- Agent 3 gets items 2 and 7, maximizing their value.
- Agent 4 doesn't get any items as their highest preferences are already taken, which is an unfortunate aspect of this small allocation problem.
- Agent 5 gets items 0 and 6, ensuring they get high value from their perspective.

This allocation seeks to balance fairness in terms of each agent's highest preferences, given the constraint of 8 items.
