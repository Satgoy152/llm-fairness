Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  98  50  37  34  62  38  74
1  59  89  86  62  38  67  38  20
2  66  31  53  28  70  23  70  14
3  71  71  27  17  91  30  62  50
4  70  98  73  38  72  84  31  52
5  73  74  35   1  60  26  95  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of items among the six agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** First, identify which items are most valued by each agent, as these will likely be the most contentious.

2. **Allocate Unique High-Valued Items:** If an item is uniquely valued highly by one agent, allocate it to that agent.

3. **Balance Total Valuations:** Ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value, based on their own valuations.

4. **Resolve Conflicts:** In cases where multiple agents highly value the same item, allocate it to the agent for whom it creates the most significant increase in satisfaction, and compensate the other agents with items they value relatively highly.

Given the matrix of values, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (98) and item 0 reasonably (81).
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly (86).
- Agent 2 values items 4 and 6 equally (70).
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (91).
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (98).
- Agent 5 values item 6 highly (95).

To resolve conflicts, we can allocate items based on the unique high valuations and then balance the remaining items to achieve a fair distribution.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 7]  (81, 74)
- Agent 1: [2]     (86)
- Agent 2: [5]     (23)
- Agent 3: [4]     (91)
- Agent 4: [1]     (98)
- Agent 5: [3, 6]  (1, 95)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and tries to balance total valuations. Some agents might receive items with lower individual valuations, but this can be compensated by ensuring they get a higher total value.

Finally, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item and utilizes all items, totaling 8 items allocated.
