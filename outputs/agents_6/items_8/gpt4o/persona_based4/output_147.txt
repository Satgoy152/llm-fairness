Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  72  19  52  70   2  32  17
1  43  23  24  80  54  16  36  51
2  99  29  85  56  91  62   4  65
3  81  16  42  79  85  73   0  29
4  56  67  41  76  68  38  70  59
5  48  58  41  63  48  27  75  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own, based on their valuations. Given the valuations matrix, we can attempt to distribute the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent. This will give us an idea of how much each agent values the entire set of items.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start by allocating the highest-valued item to the agent who values it the most. This helps in minimizing envy.

3. **Iterative Allocation:**
   - Continue allocating items to agents based on their next highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the allocation remains fair.

4. **Check for Envy:**
   - After allocation, check if any agent envies another's allocation. Adjust if necessary to improve fairness.

Given the complexity and potential for many fair allocations, here is one possible allocation that seeks to address these criteria:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the high valuations each agent has for specific items and distributes them in a manner that should minimize envy and ensures each agent receives at least one item. Note that there are multiple ways to achieve fair and envy-free allocations, and this is just one possible solution.
