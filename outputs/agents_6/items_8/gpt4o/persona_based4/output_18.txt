Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  60  15  63  54  71  64  60
1  66  56  14  43   5  55  55  75
2  82  91  69  10   1  76  67  96
3   8  94   3  28  63  90   3  43
4  78  31  50  82  91  78  11  86
5  40  14  68   8  30  42  66  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free, we can use an approach that tries to maximize the minimum satisfaction or minimize envy among all agents. Given that we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. A common strategy in fair division is to prioritize agents with the highest valuation for each item and ensure balance.

Let's proceed by examining the table of valuations. The goal is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution of items:

1. **Agent 2** has very high valuations for items 0, 1, and 7. We will assign them these items (0, 1, 7).
2. **Agent 0** also has a high valuation for item 6. We will assign them this item (6).
3. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 3 and 5. We will assign them these items (3, 5).
4. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 4. We will assign them this item (4).
5. **Agent 5** has a high valuation for item 2. We will assign them this item (2).

Following these assignments, all items are allocated, and each agent has received at least one item, except for Agent 3.

Now, let's list the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
