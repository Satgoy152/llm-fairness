Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  23  88   8  39  28  89  93
1  68  83  25  89  50  99  75  14
2   1  34  80  75  21  56  69  89
3  32  74  96   3  97  22  99  46
4  52   8  47  70  92  84  66  25
5  40  87  39  13  49  97  79  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will use the concept of maximizing Nash welfare, which is the product of the utilities of all agents. This approach often achieves a fair distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items step by step:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 (88), 6 (89), and 7 (93).
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 1 (83), 3 (89), and 5 (99).
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 2 (80), 3 (75), and 7 (89).
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 2 (96), 4 (97), and 6 (99).
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 4 (92), 5 (84), and 6 (66).
6. **Agent 5** highly values items 1 (87), 5 (97), and 6 (79).

Here is an allocation strategy based on these valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 6 and 7, as these are some of their highest values.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5, which is their highest value.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2, which is their highest value.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 4, which is their highest value.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 3, which is among their higher values.
- **Agent 5**: Assign items 0 and 1, as these are relatively high values for them, and it balances the allocation.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to minimize envy while assigning all 8 items.
