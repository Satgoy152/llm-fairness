Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  12   7  85  28   9  55  34
1  75   2  83  76  50  35  21  75
2   3  25  95   1  56  37  64   2
3  12  45  43  36  93  73  88  50
4  98  81  40  79  14  91   8  85
5   3  77  68  59   1  35  98  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy among the agents, we can use a method called "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1). This approach ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, except perhaps by the removal of a single item from the other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations of each agent for the 8 items, we aim to distribute the items to the agents such that:

1. Each agent receives at least one item.
2. The allocation is as fair as possible based on the agents' valuations.

To begin, let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 66 + 12 + 7 + 85 + 28 + 9 + 55 + 34 = 296
- Agent 1: 75 + 2 + 83 + 76 + 50 + 35 + 21 + 75 = 417
- Agent 2: 3 + 25 + 95 + 1 + 56 + 37 + 64 + 2 = 283
- Agent 3: 12 + 45 + 43 + 36 + 93 + 73 + 88 + 50 = 440
- Agent 4: 98 + 81 + 40 + 79 + 14 + 91 + 8 + 85 = 496
- Agent 5: 3 + 77 + 68 + 59 + 1 + 35 + 98 + 56 = 397

Now, we will try to assign the items so that each agent gets a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction and minimizes envy towards others.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance the total values across agents based on their preferences:

1. Agent 0 gets items [3, 0] (Values: 85, 66)
2. Agent 1 gets items [2, 7] (Values: 83, 75)
3. Agent 2 gets items [4, 6] (Values: 56, 64)
4. Agent 3 gets item [5] (Value: 73)
5. Agent 4 gets item [1] (Value: 81)
6. Agent 5 gets item [2] (Value: 68) [Edit: Due to a mistake, Agent 2 should not have item 2.]

Now, let's reallocate based on the above allocations:

1. Agent 0: [3, 0]
2. Agent 1: [7]
3. Agent 2: [4, 1]
4. Agent 3: [5]
5. Agent 4: [6]
6. Agent 5: [2]

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly based on their preferences and ensure that each agent receives at least one item. Adjustments can be made according to the specific requirements of envy-freeness, but this provides a starting point for a fair allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2]
}
```
