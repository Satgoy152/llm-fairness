Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  54  43  71  58  42   3  72
1  22  30  96  16  23   1  83  39
2   6  17  42  92  42  56  95  86
3   6  92  52  79  88  65  20  69
4  43  48  41  12  69   6  78  78
5  87  76  32  67   8  54   2  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the constraint of integer allocations, we need to carefully balance the distribution of items.

Let's follow a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Determine total items and initial distribution:** We have 8 items and 6 agents. On average, each agent should get about 1.33 items. Since we must allocate integer numbers of items, 4 agents will receive 1 item, and 2 agents will receive 2 items.

2. **Prioritize high-value items for each agent:** We will consider the highest valued items for each agent and begin the allocation process to ensure each agent gets their most valued item(s) if possible.

3. **Initial allocation based on highest valuation:**
   - Agent 0: Values item 3 at 71, and item 7 at 72. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Values item 2 at 96. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2: Values item 6 at 95. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3: Values item 1 at 92. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 4: Values item 4 at 69, and item 7 at 78 (allocated). Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
   - Agent 5: Values item 0 at 87. Allocate item 0 to Agent 5.

4. **Allocate remaining items to balance allocations:**
   - The remaining items are 3 and 5.
   - Agent 0 only has 1 item (7), Agent 1 only has 1 item (2), Agent 2 only has 1 item (6), Agent 3 only has 1 item (1), and Agent 4 only has 1 item (4).
   - Agent 5 has 1 item (0) and can receive an additional item.

5. **Final Allocation:** 
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it was among their highest valued unallocated items.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, as it complements their valuation.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has received their fair share to the best extent possible under the integer constraint:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
