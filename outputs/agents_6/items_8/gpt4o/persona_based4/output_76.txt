Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  44  65  46  57  81  10  73
1  57  17  46  92  69  44  67   5
2  91  23  11  19  53  93  52  52
3  91   9  48  57  32  48  57  50
4  53  49  15  33   1  35  21  75
5  59  89  91  33  65  17  63  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives at least some value from their allocated items. Here is a possible allocation that considers the preferences of the agents:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to get an idea of their overall valuation perspective.
2. Try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items 0 and 7, valued at 73 and 73 respectively, giving a total value of 146.
- **Agent 1**: Receives items 3, valued at 92.
- **Agent 2**: Receives items 5, valued at 93.
- **Agent 3**: Receives items 2, valued at 48.
- **Agent 4**: Receives items 4, valued at 1.
- **Agent 5**: Receives items 1 and 6, valued at 89 and 63 respectively, giving a total value of 152.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent, given their individual preferences.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
