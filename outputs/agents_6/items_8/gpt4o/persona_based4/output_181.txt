Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29   6  90  57  48  13  68  44
1  57  31  70  11  69  93  46  78
2  91  19  97  25  33  40  61  29
3  64  90  90  17  98  84  98  41
4  29  31  59  18  93  42  38  99
5  45  66   4  61  58  30  66   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Given the valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. **Assign High-Value Items:** Start by assigning high-value items to the agent who values them the most. This helps to minimize envy among agents.

2. **Balance the Allocation:** Ensure that each agent gets items that collectively have a reasonable value to them, even if they don't get their top choices.

Let's analyze and allocate based on the table:

- **Agent 0:** Has high value for item 2 (90).
- **Agent 1:** Has high value for item 5 (93).
- **Agent 2:** Has high value for items 0 (91) and 2 (97).
- **Agent 3:** Has high value for items 1 (90), 4 (98), and 6 (98).
- **Agent 4:** Has high value for items 4 (93) and 7 (99).
- **Agent 5:** Has high value for items 1 (66) and 6 (66).

We will aim to allocate these items based on the above preferences and ensure no item is assigned more than once, and each agent has at least one item, if possible:

- **Assign items to highest valuers:**
  - Item 2 to Agent 2 (97)
  - Item 5 to Agent 1 (93)
  - Item 4 to Agent 3 (98)
  - Item 7 to Agent 4 (99)
  - Item 6 to Agent 3 (98)

- **Considering remaining items and the need to distribute evenly:**
  - Item 1 to Agent 5 (66)
  - Item 3 to Agent 0 (57)
  - Item 0 to Agent 2 (91)

This approach attempts to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item or more, the total number of items allocated is 8, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
