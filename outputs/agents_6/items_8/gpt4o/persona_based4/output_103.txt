Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  43   5  50  14  38  39  50
1  49  64  24  74  70   8  27  23
2  47  86  86  74  66  34  40  31
3  24  58  70   5  83  26  98  75
4  51  38  13  32  18  52  61  84
5  66  91   9  49  96  10  67  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free division using the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. Given the valuation matrix, our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Key Valuations**: 
   Each agent has different valuations for each item. We need to ensure that the allocations maximize the satisfaction (value) for each agent while preventing envy.

2. **Assign High-Value Items**: 
   Start by allocating items that are highly valued by only one agent, reducing potential envy.

3. **Balance the Remaining Items**: 
   Distribute the remaining items in a way that balances out the total value perceived by each agent.

Given the constraint of integer allocations and the need to allocate exactly 8 items, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 highly values item 0.
- Agent 1 values items 3 and 4 quite highly.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 6.
- Agent 4 values item 7.
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly, but since it's already taken, we can give them item 5.

Let's structure the allocations with these considerations in mind:

```json
{
    "0": [0],        // Agent 0 receives item 0
    "1": [3, 4],     // Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4
    "2": [1, 2],     // Agent 2 receives items 1 and 2
    "3": [6],        // Agent 3 receives item 6
    "4": [7],        // Agent 4 receives item 7
    "5": [5]         // Agent 5 receives item 5
}
```

This allocation is fair in that it considers the highest possible value each agent can get from the available items while ensuring no agent receives more than two items, and all items are distributed.
