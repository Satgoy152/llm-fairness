Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  45  87  45  25  53  16  77
1  88  24  57  69  88  35  21  41
2  34  85  15  12  16  72  77  40
3  81   8  70  67  15  74  58  84
4  29  46  34  48  22  61  91  35
5  46  95  19  53  70  19  86  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. This can be difficult to achieve perfectly, but we can attempt to minimize envy while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Letâ€™s start by calculating total valuations for each item across all agents to understand which items are generally more valued by the group. Then, we can try to distribute items to balance these valuations across agents.

Below is a step-by-step process for allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Item Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 299
   - Item 1: 303
   - Item 2: 282
   - Item 3: 294
   - Item 4: 236
   - Item 5: 314
   - Item 6: 349
   - Item 7: 355

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign each agent one of the items with the highest personal valuation first to ensure each gets at least one highly valued item.

3. **Refine Allocation:**
   - Balance the total value of items assigned to each agent as closely as possible.

Using this approach, we can allocate items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],      // High value for agent 0
    "1": [4, 0],   // High values for agent 1
    "2": [5],      // High value for agent 2
    "3": [7],      // High value for agent 3
    "4": [6],      // High value for agent 4
    "5": [1, 3]    // High values for agent 5
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the value fairly among all agents, ensuring that each gets at least one item they value highly, while also considering the overall distribution of valuation. Each agent receives some items, and all 8 items are allocated.
