Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  15  96  86  98   6  64  34
1  89  61   2  90  98  90   6  70
2  29  35  15  28  80  11  29  68
3  90  20  20  62  84  64  54  49
4  47  77  52  85  21  44  64  36
5  24  60  49  69   3  29  85  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that the distribution is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations, one approach is to use a round-robin system or maximize the minimum value each agent receives, considering the constraints. Since we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive only one or none.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (98)
   - Second highest value: Item 2 (96)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (98)
   - Second highest value: Item 3 (90)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value: Item 4 (80)
   - Second highest value: Item 7 (68)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value: Item 0 (90)
   - Second highest value: Item 4 (84)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value: Item 3 (85)
   - Second highest value: Item 1 (77)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest value: Item 6 (85)
   - Second highest value: Item 3 (69)

Let's allocate the items based on the highest preferences while ensuring fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Allocates item 2
- **Agent 1**: Allocates item 3
- **Agent 2**: Allocates item 7
- **Agent 3**: Allocates item 0
- **Agent 4**: Allocates item 1
- **Agent 5**: Allocates item 6

Now, reallocate the remaining items to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible and maximize each agent's fairness:

- **Remaining items**: Items 4 and 5
- **Agent 0**: Allocates item 4 (second highest preference)
- **Agent 2**: Allocates item 5 (next best available)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences while ensuring a distribution of items that attempts to be as fair as possible given the constraints.
