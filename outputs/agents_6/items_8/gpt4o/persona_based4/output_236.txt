Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  63  36  47   6  88  63  45
1  65  12  92   7  52  12  70  34
2  99  28   4  78  30  53  29  85
3   0  81  40  39  67   5   6  16
4  34  96   1  10  36  72  87  52
5  45  20  14  41  29  89  72  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, or at least minimize envy, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the valuations provided, one approach is to use a method like the maximum marginal utility or the adjusted winner procedure to distribute the items. Here, I'll use an iterative greedy approach to approximate a fair distribution:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Calculate the sum of each agent's valuations for all items.
2. **Iterative Allocation**: Allocate items iteratively, giving each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of high-value items relative to their total valuation.

Here's a rough step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 99.
- **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 96.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 92.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it highly at 78, following a fair division, we allocate to Agent 0 who values it at 47 to balance their total value.
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 67.
- **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it the highest at 89.
- **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 87.
- **Item 7**: Agent 5 values it the highest at 90.

After this allocation, we ensure each agent has a similar total valuation from their allocated items.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on the highest valuations while considering overall fairness. Each item is assigned to the agent who values it significantly, but with consideration to balance total allocations.
