Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  68  54  45  62  72  84   2
1   9  93  89  60   6  16  48  98
2  32  45  15   5  36  40  67  95
3  23  37  24  96  66  25  75  62
4  83  76   6  33  84   0  29  70
5  76  73  51  52  26  86  92  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. This is a challenging problem, especially when the number of items is less than the number of agents, but we will try to achieve a division that maximizes fairness according to the given valuations.

Here is one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 most highly, so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most, so we allocate item 7 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest, so we allocate item 4 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and we need to allocate the remaining 2 items (0 and 2).

- We allocate item 2 to agent 5, as agent 5 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 compared to other agents.
- Finally, we allocate item 0 to agent 4, who has a higher valuation for it than other agents who haven't received their top choices.

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item they value highly and to distribute the remaining items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 0],
    "5": [5, 2]
}
```
