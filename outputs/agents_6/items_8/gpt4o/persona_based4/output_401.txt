Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  48  87  22  98  72  12  76
1  43  38  74   1  24  47  34  34
2  16  94  96  86  85  87  64   8
3  71  32  38  25  88   7   2  13
4  78  51  10  55   9  91   0  55
5  67  15  45  26   2  91  60  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. Given the complexity of achieving complete envy-freeness, we will focus on a fair division that attempts to minimize envy and distribute value as evenly as possible.

Here are the valuations for each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: [78, 48, 87, 22, 98, 72, 12, 76]
- Agent 1: [43, 38, 74, 1, 24, 47, 34, 34]
- Agent 2: [16, 94, 96, 86, 85, 87, 64, 8]
- Agent 3: [71, 32, 38, 25, 88, 7, 2, 13]
- Agent 4: [78, 51, 10, 55, 9, 91, 0, 55]
- Agent 5: [67, 15, 45, 26, 2, 91, 60, 66]

A fair allocation strategy is to let each agent pick their highest-value item in a round-robin manner or to use an algorithm like the "maximum product" method to maximize the product of valuations.

We will use a simple greedy algorithm to allocate one item to each agent based on their highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet. After each agent has one item, we will allocate the remaining items by repeating the process:

1. Agent 0 picks item 4 (98).
2. Agent 1 picks item 2 (74).
3. Agent 2 picks item 5 (87).
4. Agent 3 picks item 0 (71).
5. Agent 4 picks item 5 (91), but it's taken, so choose item 1 (51).
6. Agent 5 picks item 5 (91).

With one item allocated to each agent, we have two items left. Agents who have already had an item taken need to pick their next highest available:

1. Agent 2 picks item 2 (96).
2. Agent 5 picks item 7 (66).

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation is constructed to minimize envy by allowing agents to receive their highest valued items, considering available options, and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
