Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  54  48  72  50  68  23  88
1  85  83  78  88  25  15  37  17
2  78  14  47  32  15  98  94  24
3   4  31  44   7  95  98  97  84
4  90  67  31  59  97  11  93   3
5  30  94  78  37   4  11  23  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One approach to achieving this is to use a round-robin procedure based on the agents' preferences and valuations. We can also try to ensure that the total value allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations and make an allocation:

1. **Rank the items for each agent according to their valuations.**
2. **Allocate items to agents by giving each agent their highest-valued available item in a round-robin fashion until all items are allocated.**

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Round 1:**
  - Agent 0 gets item 7 (value 88).
  - Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 88).
  - Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 98).
  - Agent 3 gets item 5 (value 98, not available, so next is item 6 with value 97).
  - Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 97).
  - Agent 5 gets item 1 (value 94).

- **Round 2:**
  - Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 68).
  - Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 85).
  - Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 47).
  - Agent 3 gets item 0 (value 4, but not available, so next is item 4 with value 95, not available, so next is item 7 with value 84, not available, so next is item 3 with value 7).
  - Agent 4 gets item 0 (value 90, not available, so next is item 3 with value 59, not available, so next is item 1 with value 67).
  - Agent 5 gets item 2 (value 78, not available, so next is item 3 with value 37, not available, so next is item 3 with value 37, not available, so next is item 2 with value 78).

Now, let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 1],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
