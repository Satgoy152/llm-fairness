Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  68  54  98  66  24  50  28
1  82  39  97  82  40   1  95  65
2  62  75  41   0  96   9   4  47
3  99  45  30  94   7  82   3  16
4  97  31  37   8  50  95  92  37
5  17  65   4  93  82  94   8  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, while keeping in mind the concept of envy-freeness and the numerical constraints, we can use a simple heuristic approach. We aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Highest Valuation First**: Start by allocating items to the agent that values them the most. This approach helps in reducing envy among agents.

2. **Iterate Over Items**: For each item, find the agent who values it the highest and hasn't yet reached their maximum allocation.

3. **Assign Items**: Assign the item to the agent who values it the most.

4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until all items have been allocated.

Applying this heuristic to the given valuations:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 3 (99), assign to agent 3.
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 2 (75), assign to agent 2.
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 1 (97), assign to agent 1.
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 0 (98), assign to agent 0.
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 2 (96), assign to agent 2.
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 4 (95), assign to agent 4.
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 1 (95), assign to agent 1.
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 0 (65), assign to agent 0.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated according to the highest valuation available while considering the fairness of distribution among the agents.
