Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  69  50  62  99  87  27  38
1  19  83  65  56  66  87  44  90
2  85  18  83  83  98  76  11  70
3  17  58  23  67  30  85   7  71
4  84  20  48  14  79  66  55  92
5  34  18  26  89  15  96  87  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible within the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the different valuations each agent has for the items, we'll use these valuations to guide the allocation process, aiming to maximize individual satisfaction based on their preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 99).
2. Agent 1 gets item 7 (value 90).
3. Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 85).
4. Agent 3 gets item 5 (value 85).
5. Agent 4 gets item 6 (value 55).
6. Agent 5 gets item 3 (value 89).
7. Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 20).
8. Agent 5 gets item 2 (value 26).

This allocation attempts to give each agent one or more items they value highly, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6, 1],
    "5": [3, 2]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8, fulfilling the problem's requirements.
