Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  90  44  49  53  59  75  97
1  47  75  85  74  80  66   0  91
2  67  66  35  49  24  99  38  70
3  38  41  24   7  37  75  24   8
4  10  21  46  89  74  35  13  71
5  12  66  24  50  75  10  33  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, i.e., each agent should feel that they received at least as much value as any other agent. Since we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Our goal is to balance the allocation with respect to the agentsâ€™ valuations.

To achieve this, we must consider the valuations matrix and try to distribute the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as even as possible. We will use a greedy approach, allocating items to agents based on the highest marginal gain in value until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 97).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 99).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (value 89).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 85).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 80).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 71).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (value 33).
8. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 66).

The allocation prioritizes the highest available value for each agent iteratively until all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that maximizes their perceived value while distributing all items among the agents.
