Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  25  50  79  11  90  20   6
1  89  18  94  12  42  48  46  92
2  87  75  48  95  13  47  30   9
3  25  36  83  62  33  30  90  44
4  54   1  91   1  44  58  99  18
5  23  55  21  25  22  98  86  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents according to their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences. The goal is to assign the items in a way that each agent values their allocation as much as possible, while also balancing the total number of items each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 5 (90).
- Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 2 (94).
- Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 3 (95).
- Agent 3's highest valuation is for item 6 (90).
- Agent 4's highest valuation is for item 6 (99).
- Agent 5's highest valuation is for item 5 (98).

We can start by assigning the highest-valued items to the respective agents, and then consider the remaining items for allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0 (50)
   - Item 1 (25)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 (94)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3 (95)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 7 (44)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 6 (99)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Item 4 (22)
   - Item 5 (98)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of the items they value highly, and the total of 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```
