Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  10  98  22  87   7  29  69
1  56  13  86   7  48  24  38  60
2   4  20  52  59  27  31  94  15
3  61   4  61  65  72  89  98  99
4  63  71  33  90  24   7  75  47
5  65  66  33  91  66  52  11  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [65 66 33 91 66 52 11 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. In an envy-free allocation, each agent should feel that their share is at least as good as any other agent's share according to their own valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items and then proceed to allocate items in a manner that maximizes each agent's perceived value. The sum of valuations for each agent is:

- Agent 0: 383
- Agent 1: 332
- Agent 2: 302
- Agent 3: 549
- Agent 4: 410
- Agent 5: 466

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest total valuation. Allocate item 7, which has the highest individual value for agent 3 (99).
2. **Agent 5** has the second highest valuation. Allocate item 3, which has one of the highest values for agent 5 (91).
3. **Agent 0** can be allocated item 2, which has the highest value for agent 0 (98).
4. **Agent 4** can be allocated item 1, which has the highest value for agent 4 (71).
5. **Agent 2** can be allocated item 6, which has the highest value for agent 2 (94).
6. **Agent 1** can be allocated item 0, which has the highest value for agent 1 (56).
7. Allocate item 4 to **Agent 3**, as it is next highest for them (72).
8. Allocate item 5 to **Agent 4**, as it is next highest for them (7).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7, 4],
    "4": [1, 5],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.
