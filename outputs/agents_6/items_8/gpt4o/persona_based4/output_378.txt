Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  39  67  45  24  83  14  93
1  60  87  16  49  99  80  19  10
2  88  82  31  16  50  99   2  51
3  35   8  74  67   0  38  19  56
4  87  70  45  77  58   7  51  51
5  56  55  44  93  53  35   8  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use an approach that aims to minimize envy and create a balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations. The goal is to allocate all 8 items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 0, 2, and 7 highly with valuations of 62, 67, and 93, respectively. We allocate them item 7 which has the highest valuation for this agent.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the highest with a valuation of 99. We allocate item 4 to them.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 5 with 99. We allocate item 5 to them.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 the most with a valuation of 74. We allocate item 2 to them.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 0 and item 3 similarly with valuations of 87 and 77. We allocate item 0 to them.

6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 3 the most with a valuation of 93. Since item 3 is still available, we allocate it to them.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items to ensure all items are distributed.

7. **Agent 1**: We allocate item 1 to agent 1, where they have a valuation of 87.

8. **Agent 4**: We allocate item 6 to agent 4, where they have a valuation of 51.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one of their more highly valued items.
