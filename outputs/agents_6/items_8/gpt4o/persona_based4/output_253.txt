Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  42  77  35  47  70  44  45
1  78  29  67  79   1  46  55  12
2  74  86  55  71   8  66  45  74
3  55  38  32  56  53  76   6  72
4  62  97  82  73  33  44  21  45
5  62  97  22  70  96  43  80  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will aim to distribute the items according to each agent's preferences, ensuring that every agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We will use a method that considers the maximum valuations each agent has for the items available and then allocate based on these preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with allocating items using a priority approach based on valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (77).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (79).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (76).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (97), but it's already allocated, so next highest is item 2 (82).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (96).

Next, we need to ensure all items are allocated:
- Item 0 is not yet allocated.
- Item 6 and item 7 are not yet allocated.

Let's adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed fairly:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 5.
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 5 (as they have a high valuation for it).
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation).

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest available valuations while distributing all items fairly amongst the agents.
