Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  10  38  58  32  17  66   9
1  49  11  22   7  94   0  48  64
2  35  94  94  83  19   3   7  31
3  33  16   4  46  25   0  27  69
4   1  34   7  93  69  31  17  22
5  74  88  64  81  93  33  77  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. This means each agent should feel that they received a fair share of the items based on their own valuations. Here's one approach to achieve such an allocation:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 302
   - Agent 1: 295
   - Agent 2: 366
   - Agent 3: 220
   - Agent 4: 274
   - Agent 5: 581

2. **Determine the Proportional Share**: 
   - Total value of all items is 2038.
   - Fair share for each agent: 2038 / 6 â‰ˆ 339.67

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Assign items aiming to get each agent as close to their proportional share as possible.

4. **Allocate Items**:

   Here's a potential allocation strategy:

   - **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 72), Item 2 (value 38), Item 6 (value 66)  
     Total Value = 176

   - **Agent 1**: Item 4 (value 94), Item 7 (value 64)  
     Total Value = 158

   - **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 94), Item 3 (value 83)  
     Total Value = 177

   - **Agent 3**: Item 5 (value 0)  
     Total Value = 0

   - **Agent 4**: Item 3 (value 93)  
     Total Value = 93

   - **Agent 5**: Item 5 (value 33), Item 6 (value 77)  
     Total Value = 110

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it is a starting point. Adjustments may be needed to better balance the allocations, but let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

This is just one possible allocation. Depending on the strategy used, other allocations might provide a more balanced or envy-free solution.
