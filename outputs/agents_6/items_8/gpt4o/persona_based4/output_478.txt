Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  85  62  49  64  70  98  54
1  14  62  36  60  37   7  65  14
2  40  54  93  70  41  69  30  88
3  60  98  29  37  22  99  74  41
4  70  16   2  35  22  30  16  51
5  32  64  22  52  33  28  66   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

One possible approach is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or similar techniques. Given the constraints of this problem and the need for an integer allocation, I'll use a simpler heuristic approach to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the total allocation is fair.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 6 (98) and item 1 (85).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (60) and item 0 (14).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (93) and item 7 (88).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 1 (98) and item 5 (99).
5. **Agent 4** has relatively low valuations, but item 0 (70) is highest.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 6 (66).

Given these preferences, a fair distribution might be structured as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 6 (highest value for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (highest value for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 5 (highest value for Agent 3).
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 4 (to ensure each agent gets an item).
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 0 (high value for Agent 5).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1 and 7) fairly:

- **Agent 3** can take item 1 (high value for Agent 3).
- **Agent 2** can take item 7 (high value for Agent 2).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution aims at minimizing envy based on each agent's preferences.
