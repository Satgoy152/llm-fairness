Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  73  79  40  47  16  70  32
1  23  47  59  24  48   0  89  45
2  70  18  59   9  95  16  87  66
3  21  69  94  52  30  79  68  63
4   2  40  94  27  49  63   2  92
5  84  93  16  89  95  84  66  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to allocate items such that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with indivisible items and heterogeneous valuations. Therefore, we will try to minimize envy.

Let's use a greedy approach to assign items based on each agent's highest valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all 8 items are allocated.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 2 (value: 79).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 6 (value: 89).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 4 (value: 95).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 2, but it's already taken. Next is item 5 (value: 79).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 2, but it's already taken. Next is item 7 (value: 92).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 4, but it's already taken. Next is item 1 (value: 93).

Now, we've allocated 6 items. Let's distribute the remaining 2 items by considering the next highest available valuations for each agent to ensure all items are allocated.

7. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (value: 24).
8. **Agent 5**: Assign item 3 (value: 89).

### Final Allocations

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 0].
- Agent 1 gets item [6].
- Agent 2 gets item [4].
- Agent 3 gets item [5].
- Agent 4 gets item [7].
- Agent 5 gets items [1, 3].

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
