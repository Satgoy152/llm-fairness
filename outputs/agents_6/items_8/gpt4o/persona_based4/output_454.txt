Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  42  15   7  39  46  52  59
1  66  70  14   7  47  36  99  40
2  71  74  30  36  12   8  50   1
3  14  29  39  81  39  51   2  81
4  91   0  16  26   8   7  75  56
5  42  22  73  67  95  83  92  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations, while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and a total of eight items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation that considers the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 7 the most (value 59), so we can allocate item 7 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 6 the most (value 99), so we can allocate item 6 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most (value 74), so we can allocate item 1 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values items 3 and 7 the most (value 81 each), but item 7 is already taken. So, we allocate item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 0 the most (value 91), so we can allocate item 0 to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 4 the most (value 95), so we can allocate item 4 to agent 5.

At this point, we have allocated 6 items, and each agent has received at least one item. The remaining items are 2 and 5. We need to allocate these to ensure a fair distribution and complete the allocation.

7. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 5, who values it reasonably (value 73).
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 0, who values it reasonably (value 46).

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items distributed is 8, meeting the problem's requirements.
