Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  96  88  31  24  62  31  98
1  17  39  91  71  22  64  14  57
2  54   3  13  17  62  46  21  75
3  52  62  35  52  51   9  13  21
4  62  65  97  10  36  87  92  19
5  21  31  22  27  78   7  72  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a division that tries to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation to their own. Given that we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others might receive none. Let's try to distribute them while considering the valuations provided.

Firstly, let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: \(72 + 96 + 88 + 31 + 24 + 62 + 31 + 98 = 502\)
- Agent 1: \(17 + 39 + 91 + 71 + 22 + 64 + 14 + 57 = 375\)
- Agent 2: \(54 + 3 + 13 + 17 + 62 + 46 + 21 + 75 = 291\)
- Agent 3: \(52 + 62 + 35 + 52 + 51 + 9 + 13 + 21 = 295\)
- Agent 4: \(62 + 65 + 97 + 10 + 36 + 87 + 92 + 19 = 468\)
- Agent 5: \(21 + 31 + 22 + 27 + 78 + 7 + 72 + 63 = 321\)

Now, let's try to allocate items to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated.

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 1 (96) and 7 (98) highly. Allocate items [1, 7].
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 (91) highly. Allocate item [2].
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 (54) highly. Allocate item [0].
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 (52) and item 1 (62) highly, but item 1 is taken. Allocate item [3].
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 (92) highly. Allocate item [6].
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 4 (78) highly. Allocate item [4].

We have now allocated 7 items. The remaining item (5) should be given to the agent who would benefit the most from it based on their remaining high valuation:

- **Agent 4** has the second-highest value for item 5 (87). Allocate item [5].

Now each agent has at least one item, ensuring a degree of fairness based on their valuations.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
