Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  63  58  23  37  64  95  13
1  51  65  11  89  57  81  38  30
2  91  75  41  84  95  54   2  72
3  30  90  35  42  48  80   5  97
4  62  30  99  73  30  17  19  59
5  16  43  85  69  55  48  72   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we aim to allocate the items in such a way that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation. We will consider the valuations provided and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent receives a share that they value highly, balancing the overall distribution of value across all agents.

Here's a proposed fair allocation based on the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5]
  - Agent 0 values item 0 at 65 and item 5 at 64, which are among the highest valuations for these items.

- **Agent 1**: Items [3]
  - Agent 1 values item 3 at 89, which is their highest valuation.

- **Agent 2**: Items [4]
  - Agent 2 values item 4 at 95, which is among the highest valuations for this item.

- **Agent 3**: Items [7]
  - Agent 3 values item 7 at 97, which is their highest valuation.

- **Agent 4**: Items [2]
  - Agent 4 values item 2 at 99, which is their highest valuation.

- **Agent 5**: Items [1, 6]
  - Agent 5 values items 1 at 43 and item 6 at 72, which are reasonable choices considering remaining options.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, aiming for envy-freeness. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item or a share they value significantly.
