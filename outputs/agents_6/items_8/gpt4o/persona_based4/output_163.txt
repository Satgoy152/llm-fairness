Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  39  45  51  81  61  29  91
1  30  16  38  25  94  31  63  29
2  90  80  37  54  91  77   1  44
3  66  12  43  76   5  58   0  25
4  59  18  57  44  70   3  92  62
5  27  15  60  56  96  86  55  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. Given the limited number of items compared to the number of agents, achieving a perfectly envy-free allocation might not be possible, but we can strive for a fair and balanced distribution based on the valuations provided.

To start, let's look at the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 447
- Agent 1: 326
- Agent 2: 474
- Agent 3: 285
- Agent 4: 405
- Agent 5: 463

The goal is to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. Here's one approach to achieve a balanced allocation:

1. Allocate items to agents who value them the most to maximize satisfaction.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item where possible, to distribute items as fairly as possible given the constraints.

Let's proceed with allocations based on maximizing individual satisfaction:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (91).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (94).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (90).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (76).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (92).
- Agent 5 values item 4 the most (96), but since it's already allocated to agent 1, allocate item 5 (86).

After the initial allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [5]

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 2. Let's distribute these based on the next highest valuations:

- For item 1, agent 2 values it the most (80), but agent 2 already has item 0, which they value at 90. The next highest valuation for item 1 is by agent 0 (39), so we give item 1 to agent 0.
- For item 2, agent 5 values it the most (60), so we give item 2 to agent 5.

The final allocation is:
- Agent 0: [7, 1]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [5, 2]

Now, we'll present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5, 2]
}
```
