Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  57  42  94  22  54  56  96
1  64  31   1  65  86   1  20   1
2  29  29  25  30  55  53  82  60
3  75  58  67  82  65  46  21  70
4  89  27   7  88  37  90  16  46
5  28  56  77  33   7  32  96  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as every other agent’s allocation according to their own valuation. This is a complex problem, but we can approach a solution by attempting to maximize the minimum satisfaction among all agents.

We will use an iterative approach to allocate items, taking into account each agent's valuation to ensure a fair distribution. Here’s one possible allocation:

1. Sort the items based on the highest value any agent assigns to them.
2. Allocate items to agents who value them the most, adjusting for balance in the number of items each agent receives.

Let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by agent 4 (89), allocate to agent 4.
2. Item 1 is valued highest by agent 0 (57), allocate to agent 0.
3. Item 2 is valued highest by agent 5 (77), allocate to agent 5.
4. Item 3 is valued highest by agent 0 (94), allocate to agent 0.
5. Item 4 is valued highest by agent 1 (86), allocate to agent 1.
6. Item 5 is valued highest by agent 4 (90), allocate to agent 4.
7. Item 6 is valued highest by agent 5 (96), allocate to agent 5.
8. Item 7 is valued highest by agent 5 (97), allocate to agent 5.

Now let’s ensure each agent receives their fair share in terms of the number of items:

- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [0, 5]
- Agent 5: [2, 6, 7]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 5],
    "5": [2, 6, 7]
}
```
