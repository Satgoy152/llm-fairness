Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  96   9  60  88  32  84   7
1  92  28  44  41  40  24  78  35
2  91  46  41  79  76  42  68   9
3  22  57  90  59  59  99  61  22
4  69  11  27  90  62  93  16  78
5  68  63  33  34  99  45  31  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider a method such as the "maximum envy-free" approach, where each agent receives items that maximize their valuation while minimizing envy from others. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and the total number of items is exactly 8, we can proceed by distributing the items based on their highest valuations by agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. First, identify the highest valuations for each item and assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, and adjust by considering the next highest available valuations to ensure all items are allocated.

Following this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (92)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (96)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (90)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (90)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (99)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (99)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (84)
- Item 7: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (78)

Now, arranging these allocations to ensure all agents get at least one item if feasible:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [3, 7],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each item going to the agent who values it the most, while balancing the allocation across agents as much as feasible.
