Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  99  55  16  18  68  42  36
1  98  48  65  14  71  25  17  20
2  19  16  33  81  93  38  98  59
3  63  92  47  83  34  52  44  65
4   3  58  99  56  54  33  98  94
5  25  11  56  97  72  92   8  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for an envy-free allocation, we can use a method such as the "Maximin Share" approach, where each agent gets as close as possible to their fair share of the total value of all items.

First, let's determine the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 7 + 99 + 55 + 16 + 18 + 68 + 42 + 36 = 341
- Agent 1: 98 + 48 + 65 + 14 + 71 + 25 + 17 + 20 = 358
- Agent 2: 19 + 16 + 33 + 81 + 93 + 38 + 98 + 59 = 437
- Agent 3: 63 + 92 + 47 + 83 + 34 + 52 + 44 + 65 = 480
- Agent 4: 3 + 58 + 99 + 56 + 54 + 33 + 98 + 94 = 495
- Agent 5: 25 + 11 + 56 + 97 + 72 + 92 + 8 + 42 = 403

To allocate the items, we will aim to maximize each agent's minimum satisfaction.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance the values for each agent:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 99)
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 98)
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (value 98)
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (value 83)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 4 (value 99)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 5 (value 92)
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (value 59)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 71)

This allocation attempts to balance the highest values each agent can receive while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8, as required.
