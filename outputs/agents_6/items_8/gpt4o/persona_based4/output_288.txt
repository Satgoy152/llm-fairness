Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6   4   3  24  24  91  64  79
1  31  34  33  97  36  36  65  55
2  71   0  96  70  38  49  97  73
3   6   0  49  79   1  81  50  41
4  15  63  70  26  54  23  98  30
5  91  97  90  39  61  94  99  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, we can use the max-min fair division approach. This method attempts to maximize the minimum value an agent receives, ensuring each agent feels they get a fair share according to their valuations.

Given the valuations, let's allocate items to each agent step-by-step:

1. **Agent 5** values items 1 and 5 highly. We allocate item 1 to Agent 5.
2. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest. We allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 3. We allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 5 the most, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 the most. We allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most. We allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
7. **Agent 5** now can be allocated item 4, as it is the highest remaining. Allocate item 4 to Agent 5.
8. **Agent 2** can be allocated the remaining item, which is item 5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, the allocation is complete with each agent receiving at least one item, and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest personal valuations for each agent and distributes the items as fairly as possible.
