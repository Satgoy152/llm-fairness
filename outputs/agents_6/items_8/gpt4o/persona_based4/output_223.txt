Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95   2  54  87  59  85  47  64
1  10  30  82  73   4  61  81   3
2  41  36  66  60  88  45   4  48
3  10   0  53  90  94  61  92  53
4  48  10  46  89  75  18  27  71
5  67  27  46  49  28  86  66  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that respects the principles of envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their own allocation as highly as possible without desiring another agent's bundle. We'll use the following strategy based on maximizing each agent's minimum allocation value:

1. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.**
2. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, but prioritize minimizing envy.**

Given the table of valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest (95).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the highest (36).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest (82).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest (90).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the highest (94).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it the highest (86).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the highest (92).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 5 values it the highest (81).

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item, and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 has 1 item.
- Agent 1 has 1 item.
- Agent 2 has 1 item.
- Agent 3 has 3 items.
- Agent 4 has no items.
- Agent 5 has 2 items.

Adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

1. Move Item 1 from Agent 2 to Agent 4, as Agent 2 has a low value for it, ensuring Agent 4 gets an item.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 4, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
