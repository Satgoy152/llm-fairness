Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  30  97  45  72  49  66  29
1  12  20  50  18  88   3  10  71
2  69   5   4   5  82  59  10  67
3  12  10  74  52  10  21  13  36
4  97  34  38  41  89  93  10  86
5  19  80  34  27  68   5  71  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute all 8 items among the 6 agents such that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Here's a possible allocation considering the valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values Item 2, so we assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values Item 4 and Item 7, so we assign those to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values Item 0 and Item 4, but since Item 4 is already taken, we assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 does not have extremely high valuations for any particular item, but Item 3 seems reasonable, so we assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values Item 5 and Item 0 highly, but since Item 0 is already taken, we assign Item 5 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values Item 1 and Item 7 highly, but since Item 7 is already taken, we assign Item 1 to Agent 5.

Some items may need to be reallocated to ensure all items are assigned. Let's reassess the allocation to ensure all items are assigned:

- Assign Item 6 to Agent 5, as it is one of the remaining items.

So, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [4, 7]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [1, 6]

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures all items are allocated, taking into account the highest valuations while trying to maintain fairness across the agents.
