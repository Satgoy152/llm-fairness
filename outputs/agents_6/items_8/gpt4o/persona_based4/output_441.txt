Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  25  33  47  35  61  79  37
1  73   3  78   0  22   5  72  55
2  12   5  83  74  16  17   1  27
3  17  70  34  96  98  92  58  52
4  47  96  68  53  20  40  39  38
5  50  87  27  31  62  53  44   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the six agents, we will consider a process that aims to ensure envy-freeness, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items must be allocated, we can employ a simple algorithm such as the round-robin method or a value-based approach to allocate items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate total valuations for each agent**: Sum the values of all items for each agent to get an idea of their overall preference.

2. **Assign items to agents**: Start by allocating the most valued items to each agent in a manner that ensures each agent gets items they value highly while trying to keep the distribution as envy-free as possible.

Given the table, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the highest (79). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest (78). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the highest (83), but since item 2 is already allocated, assign their next highest valued item, item 3 (74).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the highest (98). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the highest (96). Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
- **Agent 5**: Values item 1 highly (87), but since item 1 is already allocated, assign their next highest valued item, item 5 (53).

With these allocations, the remaining items are 0 and 7. To distribute these fairly:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 0 (49).
- **Agent 3**: Next highest value is item 7 (52).

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed and aims to reduce potential envy among agents.
