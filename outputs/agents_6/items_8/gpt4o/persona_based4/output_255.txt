Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  53  87  53  32   2  29  66
1  90  72  30   4  30  44   3  43
2  36  23  23  58  52  30  48  64
3  71  90   0  26  22  89  92  47
4  67  96  61  71  66  85  63  51
5  68  47  75   5  52  81  62  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider both the valuations of each item by each agent and aim for an envy-free distribution. This typically means that each agent should prefer their own allocation, or at least be indifferent, compared to what others receive. Given the constraint of integer allocations, we should also ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's approach this by first calculating the sum of valuations for each item across all agents to understand their relative importance. Then, we'll attempt to allocate the items based on maximizing total happiness while considering fairness.

### Total Valuations of Each Item Across All Agents

```
Item 0: 17 + 90 + 36 + 71 + 67 + 68 = 349
Item 1: 53 + 72 + 23 + 90 + 96 + 47 = 381
Item 2: 87 + 30 + 23 + 0 + 61 + 75 = 276
Item 3: 53 + 4 + 58 + 26 + 71 + 5 = 217
Item 4: 32 + 30 + 52 + 22 + 66 + 52 = 254
Item 5: 2 + 44 + 30 + 89 + 85 + 81 = 331
Item 6: 29 + 3 + 48 + 92 + 63 + 62 = 297
Item 7: 66 + 43 + 64 + 47 + 51 + 36 = 307
```

### Proposed Allocation

Let's try to assign items by considering the highest valuations first, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no agent gets more than 2 items given there are 8 items and 6 agents.

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (87)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (90)
- **Agent 2**: Item 7 (64)
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (92)
- **Agent 4**: Item 1 (96)
- **Agent 5**: Item 5 (81)
- Remaining items: Item 3 and Item 4

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (52)
- **Agent 3**: Item 3 (26)

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's happiness based on their highest valuations while also attempting to maintain fairness by distributing items such that each agent gets an allocation that is highly valued by them.
