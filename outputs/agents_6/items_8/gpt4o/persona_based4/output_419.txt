Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  78  13  61  69  94  76   7
1  78  34   8  33  28  55  73   7
2   3   9  25  66  61   2  84  81
3  39  31  31   3   8  31  62  37
4  39  98  95  53  87  90  87  47
5  92  83  77   9  97  11  16  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to create an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. Given the valuation matrix and a total of 8 items, the goal is to allocate these items to the 6 agents in a manner that minimizes envy.

To achieve this, we can use a heuristic approach that involves assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. However, since there are more agents than items, some agents will inevitably receive no items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item:** For each item, find the agent who values it the most.
2. **Allocate the items based on these highest values:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. **Ensure all items are allocated:** With only 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will not receive any items.

**Allocation Process:**

- **Item 0:** Highest value by Agent 5 (value 92).
- **Item 1:** Highest value by Agent 4 (value 98).
- **Item 2:** Highest value by Agent 4 (value 95).
- **Item 3:** Highest value by Agent 2 (value 66).
- **Item 4:** Highest value by Agent 5 (value 97).
- **Item 5:** Highest value by Agent 0 (value 94).
- **Item 6:** Highest value by Agent 2 (value 84).
- **Item 7:** Highest value by Agent 2 (value 81).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 6, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while still keeping within the constraint of only 8 items in total.
