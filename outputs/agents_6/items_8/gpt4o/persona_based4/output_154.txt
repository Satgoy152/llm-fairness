Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  68  59  79  66  15  51  84
1  80  25  79  78  71  26  37  48
2  21  63   1  99  15  93  29   4
3  60   8  55  77  49  13  13  38
4  20  11  37  10  73   4  38   4
5  46  13  31  92  96  83  11   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, considering the valuations.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 465
- Agent 1: 444
- Agent 2: 325
- Agent 3: 313
- Agent 4: 197
- Agent 5: 377

A simple method to achieve a fair allocation is to use a round-robin strategy based on each agentâ€™s highest value for an unallocated item. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Round 1**: Each agent gets their highest valued item that is still available.

    - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 84)
    - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 80)
    - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 99)
    - Agent 3 picks item 3 (already taken, next highest is item 0, but taken, so then item 2)
    - Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 73)
    - Agent 5 picks item 4 (already taken, next highest is item 3, but taken, so then item 5)

2. **Round 2**: Repeat with remaining items.

    - Agent 0 picks item 3 (already taken, next highest item is 4, but taken, so then item 1)
    - Agent 1 picks item 4 (already taken, next highest is item 3, but taken, so then item 7)
    - Agent 2 picks item 1 (already taken, next highest is item 5, but taken, so then item 6)
    - Agent 3 picks item 0 (already taken, next highest is item 5, but taken, so then item 7)
    - Agent 4 picks item 4 (already taken, next highest item 5, but taken, so then item 2)
    - Agent 5 picks item 5 (already taken, next highest is item 3, but taken, so then item 2)

3. **Final Adjustments**: Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. 

   Let's resolve with the following allocation, ensuring that all 8 items are distributed among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on the highest values while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.
