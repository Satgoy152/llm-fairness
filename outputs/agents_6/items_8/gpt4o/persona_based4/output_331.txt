Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  31  68  80  94  94  89  87
1  93  20  36  67  22  91   0  90
2  14   3  21  67  90  15  97  54
3  61  80  91  75  52  10  79  95
4  40   7  99   6  96  31  90  80
5  52  51  29  89   7   8  86   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share considering their valuations. A common approach in fair division is to try to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or minimizes envy to the extent possible, given the constraints.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Considerations**:
   - We have 6 agents and 8 items.
   - Each agent should ideally receive at least one item, but given there are more agents than items, at least two agents will receive no items. The focus will be on maximizing total value for each agent based on their preferences.

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and try to allocate items to match these valuations as closely as possible.
   - A greedy approach can be used where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, but care is taken to ensure minimal envy and fair distribution of items.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Item 0 is valued most by Agent 1 (93).
   - Item 1 is valued most by Agent 3 (80).
   - Item 2 is valued most by Agent 4 (99).
   - Item 3 is valued most by Agent 5 (89).
   - Item 4 is valued most by Agent 2 (90).
   - Item 5 is valued most by Agent 0 (94).
   - Item 6 is valued most by Agent 2 (97).
   - Item 7 is valued most by Agent 3 (95).

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [5]
   - Agent 1: [0]
   - Agent 2: [4, 6]
   - Agent 3: [1, 7]
   - Agent 4: [2]
   - Agent 5: [3]

5. **JSON Format**:
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, which should minimize envy to some extent. Although not all agents receive items, given the constraint of more agents than items, this allocation maximizes the satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.
