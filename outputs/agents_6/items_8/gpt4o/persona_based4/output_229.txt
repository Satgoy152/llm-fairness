Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14   9  11  40  24  62  17  59
1  15  12  86  14  49  89  98   4
2  23  73  43  13  54  81  48   9
3  81  42  99  92  11  74  72  27
4  68  54  49  19   0  92  78  41
5  96  90  40  85  26  35  70  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we'll use an approach that considers both efficiency and fairness, such as the "Envy-Free" allocation. We aim to allocate all items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

A simple method to achieve this is to use a "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach based on the agents' rankings of items. Considering the valuations provided, we'll proceed to allocate items step-by-step to ensure each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy.

Here's a possible allocation considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (valuation 98), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (valuation 99), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
3. **Agent 5** highly values item 0 (valuation 96), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 5.
4. **Agent 5** also highly values item 1 (valuation 90), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 5.
5. **Agent 1** values item 5 next (valuation 89), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 3** values item 3 (valuation 92), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
7. **Agent 2** values item 4 (valuation 54), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
8. **Agent 4** gets item 7 as it's the highest remaining value for them (valuation 41).

Now let's summarize this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
