Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  25  36  53  78  68  10  84
1  79  42  98  67   6  93   5  98
2  23  69   3  48   7  62  59  60
3  34  38  54  22  87  33  62  12
4  74  95  75  32   9  38  28  60
5  29  48  25  47  63  47  36  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation or an allocation that minimizes envy. Since each agent can receive an integer number of items and we have 8 items to distribute among 6 agents, not every agent will receive an item.

One possible approach is to use a round-robin method based on the highest valuation of unallocated items by each agent or a similar heuristic method to ensure fairness.

Here is one possible allocation, considering the valuations and ensuring that each agent gets at least one item when possible and reducing envy:

1. Start by allocating each agent their most valued item that hasn't already been allocated.

2. Continue allocating the next most valued item that remains unallocated to each agent in a round-robin fashion.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0's highest values are for item 7 (84).
- Agent 1's highest values are for item 2 (98).
- Agent 2's highest values are for item 1 (69).
- Agent 3's highest values are for item 4 (87).
- Agent 4's highest values are for item 1 (95), but since it is taken, item 0 (74) is the next.
- Agent 5's highest values are for item 4 (63), but since it is taken, item 7 (61) is the next.

Let's distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 1 can take item 5 (93).
- Agent 0 can take item 3 (53).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item based on their highest valuation among the unallocated items. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6]
}
```

Thus, each item is allocated, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
