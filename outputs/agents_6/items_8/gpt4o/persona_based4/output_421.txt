Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17   5  93  86  74  35  50  68
1  51  56  53  61  32  10   0  92
2  10  57  40  36  84   6  29  12
3  95  37  36  87  18  75   3  71
4  36  79   9  77  83  84  99  57
5  38  89  73  31  47  49  35  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute them such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. A common approach is to use the "envy-free up to one item" criterion, where no agent envies another's allocation after removing one item from the envied agent's bundle.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Identify items with high unique values for each agent, and try to prioritize giving those items to the respective agents.
2. Balance the allocations such that each agent receives approximately equal total value according to their own valuations.

Here's one possible allocation that strives for fairness:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (93) and item 3 (86).
- Agent 1 highly values item 7 (92).
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (84).
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 (95).
- Agent 4 highly values item 6 (99).
- Agent 5 highly values item 1 (89).

Let's assign these items first:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to agent 3.
- Assign item 6 to agent 4.
- Assign item 1 to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to distribute the remaining 2 items (3 and 5) in a way that tries to balance the perceived value for each agent:

- Assign item 3 to agent 3, as they already have a high value (87) for it.
- Assign item 5 to agent 4, as they have a relatively high value (84) for it.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [0, 3]
- Agent 4: [6, 5]
- Agent 5: [1]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [6, 5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
