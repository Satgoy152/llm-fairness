Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  90  22  91  64  27  84   9
1  80  18  74  88  23  12  56  69
2  74  40  42   5  90  50   8  63
3  74  24  24  80  86  53  20  95
4   3  93   8  11  97  55  86  11
5   7  98   6  12  12  18  30  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences. Given there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but the goal is to ensure the perceived fairness in terms of value.

Let's follow a procedure to allocate these items:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Allocate based on highest valuations**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust allocations for fairness**: If possible, make adjustments to balance the allocation in terms of total value received by each agent.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

- **Item 0** is valued highest by Agent 1 (value 80).
- **Item 1** is valued highest by Agent 5 (value 98).
- **Item 2** is valued highest by Agent 1 (value 74).
- **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 0 (value 91).
- **Item 4** is valued highest by Agent 4 (value 97).
- **Item 5** is valued highest by Agent 4 (value 55).
- **Item 6** is valued highest by Agent 0 (value 84).
- **Item 7** is valued highest by Agent 3 (value 95).

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 2: Items []
- Agent 3: Items [7]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 5: Items [1]

### Final Adjustments:
- Since Agent 2 has no items, we may consider redistributing to ensure each agent has at least one item, if possible, without drastically reducing the fairness. However, given the constraint of exactly 8 items and the current allocations maximizing each agent's perceived value, a shift might not be feasible without reducing overall satisfaction.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items while still adhering to the requirement of distributing exactly 8 items among the 6 agents.
