Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  42  50  37  74  27  87  77
1  62  16  71  48  74  28  78  63
2   7  54  50  24  57  58  75  70
3  62  41  31  15  75   0  85  58
4   8  95   3  71  13  34  72  67
5   0  31  30  42  20  55  47  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent perceives from all items combined.**
2. **Assign items to maximize each agent's perceived share while minimizing envy.** 
3. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.**

Let's allocate the items based on these principles:

- **Agent 0** values items 0 (76) and 6 (87) highly.
- **Agent 1** values items 2 (71) and 4 (74) highly.
- **Agent 2** values items 5 (58) and 6 (75) highly.
- **Agent 3** values items 0 (62) and 6 (85) highly.
- **Agent 4** values item 1 (95) highly.
- **Agent 5** values item 7 (88) highly.

By selecting items such that each agent gets some of their most valued items, we can minimize envy. Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
- Assign items 0 and 7 to Agent 5.

Let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [0, 7]

Now, we have allocated all 8 items. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences, aiming for a fair and balanced distribution.
