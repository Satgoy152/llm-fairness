Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  79  57  61  85  86  66  97
1   0  28  71  59   5  92  58  69
2  35  58  17  76  55  19  74  90
3  72  76  75  36  95  93  49  20
4  98  70   0   7  65  86  28  22
5  99  14  94  35   3  86  69  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items among the agents in a way that is fair and minimizes envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, and some may receive none.

Let's consider the following steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item by Each Agent:** 
   - This helps us understand the relative importance of each item to each agent.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair allocation.

3. **Attempt to Balance the Total Value Received by Each Agent:** 
   - After initial allocation, adjust allocations if necessary to ensure no agent feels significantly envious of another.

Here is a possible allocation, trying to balance fairness and minimize envy:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 5]
  - Agent 0 values item 0 at 68 and item 5 at 86, both of which are among the highest values compared to other agents.

- **Agent 1:** [6]
  - Agent 1 values item 6 at 58, which is relatively high compared to their valuation of other items.

- **Agent 2:** [7]
  - Agent 2 values item 7 at 90, which is the highest valuation for item 7 among all agents.

- **Agent 3:** [4]
  - Agent 3 values item 4 at 95, which is the highest valuation for item 4 among all agents.

- **Agent 4:** [1]
  - Agent 4 values item 1 at 70, which is the highest valuation for item 1 among all agents.

- **Agent 5:** [2, 3]
  - Agent 5 values item 2 at 94 and item 3 at 35, which combined provide a reasonable valuation for agent 5.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly while attempting to balance the total valuation across agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```
