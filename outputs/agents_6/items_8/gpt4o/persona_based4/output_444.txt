Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  35  53  60  42  72  43  78
1  97  49  12  71  56  20  50  66
2  47  15   6  33  69  98  55  27
3  19   6   9  69  24  17  15  36
4  76  82  81  30   4  52  55  65
5  75  58  96  84  63  92  89  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we must ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent. Given the different valuations of each agent for each item, we can use a method such as the adjusted winner procedure or a simple round-robin selection based on the highest value for each agent. Here, we'll use a form of round-robin where each agent gets to pick the item they value the most that hasn't been chosen yet.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Start with Agent 0, allow them to pick their most valued item that hasn't been taken yet.
2. Move to Agent 1 and repeat the process, continuing in order until all items are allocated.

Following this process:

- Agent 0 starts by picking item 7 (value 78).
- Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 97).
- Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 98).
- Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 69).
- Agent 4 picks item 1 (value 82).
- Agent 5 picks item 2 (value 96).

Now, each agent has picked their highest valued item that's available, and we continue with the remaining items:

- Agent 0 picks item 5 next (value 72) because 7 is already taken.
- Agent 1 picks item 3 next (value 71) because 0 is already taken.
- Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 55) because 5 is already taken.
- Agent 3 picks item 4 (value 24) because 3 is already taken.
- Agent 4 picks item 2 (value 81) because 1 is already taken.
- Agent 5 picks item 6 (value 89) because 2 is already taken.

However, note that some items have been picked twice due to oversight, and we need to adjust:

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

Upon re-evaluation, ensure that allocations are unique and each item is assigned once:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

Please ensure that each agent values their allocation equally or more than others for a fair division, while the process above aims to achieve that.
