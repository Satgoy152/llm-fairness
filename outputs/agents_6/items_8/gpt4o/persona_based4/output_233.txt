Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  37  55  10  11   2  59  75
1  12  59   3  84  90   7  32  95
2  98  53  95  78   3  75  67  17
3  20  87  71  41  55  15  88  14
4  71   9  29  31  45  75  15  31
5  27  95  79   9   1  40  90  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we'll aim to maximize each agent's utility based on their given valuations. Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences**: Start by identifying the items most valued by each agent to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they highly value.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign items based on the highest value for each agent while ensuring no agent is left with zero items.

3. **Balancing Allocation**: Review allocations to ensure that each agent is not envious of another agent's allocation.

4. **Adjustments**: Make necessary adjustments to achieve a more balanced allocation if initial allocations are not optimal.

Given the values, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 highly (75).
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most (95).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (98).
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly (87).
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly (75).
- Agent 5 values item 7 highly (97).

Let's allocate based on these preferences and adjust:

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 2: [0] (highest value)
   - Agent 3: [1] (high value)
   - Agent 5: [7] (high value)
   - Agent 4: [5] (high value)

2. **Adjustments**:
   - Agent 1: [3, 4] (next highest values after 7)
   - Agent 0: [2] (highest available)
   - Agent 5: [6] (next highest after 7)

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [2]
   - Agent 1: [3, 4]
   - Agent 2: [0]
   - Agent 3: [1]
   - Agent 4: [5]
   - Agent 5: [6, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and the distribution is relatively balanced.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6, 7]
}
```
