Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  12  87   0  37  86  46  92
1  30  36  86  60  41  55  86  13
2  63  19  76  32  66  13  19  95
3  77  97  67  95  40  85  73  10
4  33   5  30  99  32  38  60   7
5   9  40  63  10   1  73  64  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a simple approach like a round-robin distribution based on descending order of item valuations. This doesn't guarantee envy-freeness in the strictest sense, but it provides a balanced initial allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate total valuations for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate items to agents in a round-robin manner based on who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (77), allocate to Agent 3.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most (97), allocate to Agent 3.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (87), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most (99), allocate to Agent 4.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (66), allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (86), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (64), allocate to Agent 5.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (95), allocate to Agent 2.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. We have allocated all 8 items, and each agent is assigned items based on their highest valuations.

Here is the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
