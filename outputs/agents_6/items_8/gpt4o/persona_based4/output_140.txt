Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  80  50  35  52  80  76  93
1  93  75   9  42  94   8  89  14
2  81  31  35  82  26  76  87  28
3  46  87  93  74  20  46  17  57
4  56  70  11  65  44  57  11  53
5  70  24  66  36   0   8  95  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 75  9 42 94  8 89 14]
 [81 31 35 82 26 76 87 28]

 [70 24 66 36  0  8 95 78]]
Output:
In this scenario, we need to allocate 8 items among 6 agents based on the given valuations matrix, ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible. One approach to achieve this is by using the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the table of valuations, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their own allocation relative to the valuations they assign to the items. Below is a potential allocation that strives to maintain fairness:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 5. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0 and 4. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 3 and 6. Assign item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 2 and 3. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 5 and 3. Assign item 3 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** highly values items 6 and 7. Assign item 7 to agent 5.

Let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Item 4 is not yet assigned. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Item 5 is not yet assigned. Assign item 5 to agent 0.

Now, each agent gets a fair allocation considering their preferences, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7]
}
```
