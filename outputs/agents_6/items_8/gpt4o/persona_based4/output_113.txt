Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  87  16  60  34  46   0  94
1  55  78   9  57  37  87  73  39
2  38  69  21  26  67  20  42  85
3  99  18  84  60  99  53  87  18
4  81  28   8  78  24  13  99  29
5  58  11  40  44  53   3  85  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy. Since we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than others. We can use a strategy that tries to balance the total valuation each agent has for their assigned items.

After analyzing the given valuations, here is one possible fair allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 3: Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (99).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (87).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3: Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (84).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4: Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (78).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (99).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1: Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (87).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4: Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (99).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 5: Agent 5 values item 7 the highest (91).

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives at least one high-value item according to their preferences. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 2, 4],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [7]
}
```

In this allocation, all 8 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with some agents receiving more items based on their higher valuations for those items.
