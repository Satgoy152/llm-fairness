Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  57  25  88  27   1  54  55
1  11  37   7  38   3  80  91  51
2  42  26  12   5  84  86  26  80
3  28  67  41   1  95  67  64  64
4   5  57  19  16  78   2  98  55
5  28  78  10   5  14  52   7  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating the 8 items among the 6 agents based on their valuations, we aim to find an allocation that ensures some notion of fairness, such as maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives or minimizing envy.

One approach is to use the "maximum minimum" rule, which attempts to allocate items such that the agent with the lowest total valuation receives the highest possible minimum value. Given the valuations, we can strategically allocate items to balance the distribution of value among agents.

Here's an allocation that attempts to balance fairness by considering each agent's preferences:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 73).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 5 (value 78).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value 41).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 88).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 95).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 86).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 98).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value 51).

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, where possible, and takes into account the differing values assigned by each agent to the items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a collection of items intended to maximize their satisfaction based on their given valuations, while also ensuring all items are distributed among the agents.
