Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  79  15  88  62  34  55  21
1  93  23  66  59  69  54  30  63
2  70  45  90  42  80  64  35  35
3  45  65  92  63  71  61  42  18
4  46  47  76  64  90  68   2  82
5  14   3  66  79  72  70  96  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. We'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent feels they've received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's one way to proceed:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall assessment.
2. Try to allocate items to maximize each agent's minimum satisfaction.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 64 + 79 + 15 + 88 + 62 + 34 + 55 + 21 = 418
- Agent 1: 93 + 23 + 66 + 59 + 69 + 54 + 30 + 63 = 457
- Agent 2: 70 + 45 + 90 + 42 + 80 + 64 + 35 + 35 = 461
- Agent 3: 45 + 65 + 92 + 63 + 71 + 61 + 42 + 18 = 457
- Agent 4: 46 + 47 + 76 + 64 + 90 + 68 + 2 + 82 = 475
- Agent 5: 14 + 3 + 66 + 79 + 72 + 70 + 96 + 11 = 411

Let's allocate the items in a manner that aims to balance the value each agent receives.

### Allocation Strategy

Assign items in a way that each agent gets at least one high-value item (from their perspective) to ensure envy-freeness:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (88), Item 0 (64)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (93), Item 6 (30)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (90), Item 5 (64)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (92), Item 4 (71)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (90), Item 7 (82)
- Agent 5: Item 6 (96), Item 3 (79)

Re-assess to ensure each agent receives at least one item and that each item is only allocated once. Adjust accordingly to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is balanced based on their valuations to maximize perceived fairness.
