Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  61  84  50  55  45  72  54
1  28  78  64  27  94  53  95  64
2  69  80  64  78  17  65  80   6
3  36   7  83  52  22  62  90  19
4  23  41  33  12  80  51  24  93
5  69  86   1  28  74  21  71  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while also considering the overall fairness of the allocation. A common criterion for fairness is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations of each agent for the items, we can apply a heuristic approach to allocate items. One simple way to achieve a fair allocation is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the sum of item values for each agent is roughly similar.

Here's a step-by-step outline of the allocation process:

1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty allocation for each agent.
2. **Sort Items by Value**: For each agent, sort the items by their value in descending order.
3. **Round-Robin Assignment**: Use a round-robin approach to assign items to agents based on the sorted values, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
4. **Check Fairness**: After the initial allocation, adjust the assignment to minimize envy by swapping items between agents if needed.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (84)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (95)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (80)
   - Agent 3: Item 6 (90)
   - Agent 4: Item 7 (93)
   - Agent 5: Item 1 (86)

2. **Adjust for Fairness**:
   - After assigning the top-valued items, we need to distribute the remaining items to ensure that all items are allocated.

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [2]  (84)
   - Agent 1: [6]  (95)
   - Agent 2: [1]  (80)
   - Agent 3: [3, 5]  (52, 62)
   - Agent 4: [7]  (93)
   - Agent 5: [0, 4]  (69, 74)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while keeping the overall distribution fair.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```
