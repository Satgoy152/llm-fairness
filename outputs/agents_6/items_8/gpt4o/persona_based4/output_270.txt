Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  17  53  42  72  55  32  31
1   7  65   6  93  80  56  72  16
2  43  10  34   7  59  55  30  26
3  21  77  18  20  87  91  73   4
4  19   7  26  89  83  34  51  60
5  47  80  25   6  73  49  10  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in an envy-free manner, I will use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction based on their valuations. This involves ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's proceed by analyzing the valuations and distributing the items:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest values: Item 4 (72), Item 0 (53), Item 2 (53)

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest values: Item 3 (93), Item 4 (80), Item 1 (65)

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest values: Item 0 (43), Item 4 (59), Item 5 (55)

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Highest values: Item 5 (91), Item 4 (87), Item 1 (77)

5. **Agent 4**:  
   - Highest values: Item 3 (89), Item 4 (83), Item 7 (60)

6. **Agent 5**:  
   - Highest values: Item 7 (97), Item 1 (80), Item 4 (73)

To distribute items fairly, we can start by allocating the items to the agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that no agent is envious of another's allocation.

**Allocation Process:**

1. Agent 1 gets Item 3 (highest valuation)
2. Agent 3 gets Item 5 (highest valuation)
3. Agent 5 gets Item 7 (highest valuation)
4. Agent 0 gets Item 4 (highest among remaining)
5. Agent 4 gets Item 2
6. Agent 2 gets Item 0
7. Agent 3 gets Item 1 (second highest valuation)
8. Agent 4 gets Item 6

After this allocation, each agent has at least one item, and the distribution is aimed to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [7]
}
```
