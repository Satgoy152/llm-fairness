Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  71  86  91  11  66  92  63
1  47  60  52  64  71  25  24  87
2   2  91   7  99  74  44  86  86
3  72  66  75  68  52  28  29  26
4  61  10  94  45   7  48   6  20
5  88  97  52   2   2  63  39  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and a balanced distribution, one common approach is to consider maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Given the table of valuations, we can use a method like the "maximum marginal utility" or a similar greedy algorithm to achieve a fair division.

Let's begin by analyzing the table and then proceed with the allocation process. Since there are 8 items and 6 agents, not all agents will receive an item. We will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives to ensure a fair distribution.

**Allocation Steps:**

1. **Item 0 (Agent 5):** The highest valuation is 88 by agent 5.
2. **Item 1 (Agent 5):** The highest valuation is 97 by agent 5.
3. **Item 2 (Agent 0):** The highest valuation is 86 by agent 0.
4. **Item 3 (Agent 2):** The highest valuation is 99 by agent 2.
5. **Item 4 (Agent 1):** The highest valuation is 71 by agent 1.
6. **Item 5 (Agent 0):** The highest valuation is 66 by agent 0.
7. **Item 6 (Agent 0):** The highest valuation is 92 by agent 0.
8. **Item 7 (Agent 1):** The highest valuation is 87 by agent 1.

We can adjust allocations if necessary to ensure each agent receives a fair share, considering both the total number of items and maximizing valuations. However, due to the constraints, some agents may not receive any items. 

Let's allocate with these selections, ensuring a balanced approach:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each of the 8 items is distributed, with agents receiving items based on their highest valuations, while also trying to balance the number of items each agent receives, to the extent possible given the constraints.
