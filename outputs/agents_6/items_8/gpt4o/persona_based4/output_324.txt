Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  68  31  35  91  51  57  18
1  54  28  89  86  30  37   2  90
2   7  80  72  25  41  35  62  99
3  22   1  98  57  75  20  51  52
4  31   4  51  24  19  49  74  40
5  92   7   2  41  17   6  86  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we'll aim to distribute the items among the agents in a way that is as fair as possible, considering the valuations provided. We have 8 items and 6 agents, which means not every agent will receive an item, but we will ensure that each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Here is a potential approach for achieving a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate total valuations**: Compute the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand each agent's preference.

2. **Fair allocation strategy**: Use an algorithm like the Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) criterion to allocate items as fairly as possible. This means that no agent should feel envy towards another agent's allocation if they could remove one item from the envied agent's allocation.

3. **Iterative allocation**: Allocate items iteratively based on the highest remaining value for each item, taking into account previous allocations to maintain fairness.

Let's compute the allocations:

### Calculations

- **Agent 0**: Total valuation = 53 + 68 + 31 + 35 + 91 + 51 + 57 + 18 = 404
- **Agent 1**: Total valuation = 54 + 28 + 89 + 86 + 30 + 37 + 2 + 90 = 416
- **Agent 2**: Total valuation = 7 + 80 + 72 + 25 + 41 + 35 + 62 + 99 = 421
- **Agent 3**: Total valuation = 22 + 1 + 98 + 57 + 75 + 20 + 51 + 52 = 376
- **Agent 4**: Total valuation = 31 + 4 + 51 + 24 + 19 + 49 + 74 + 40 = 292
- **Agent 5**: Total valuation = 92 + 7 + 2 + 41 + 17 + 6 + 86 + 21 = 272

### Allocation

1. **Item 0** (highest valuation by Agent 5): Allocate to Agent 5
2. **Item 1** (highest valuation by Agent 2): Allocate to Agent 2
3. **Item 2** (highest valuation by Agent 3): Allocate to Agent 3
4. **Item 3** (highest valuation by Agent 1): Allocate to Agent 1
5. **Item 4** (highest valuation by Agent 0): Allocate to Agent 0
6. **Item 5** (highest valuation by Agent 0): Allocate to Agent 0
7. **Item 6** (highest valuation by Agent 5): Allocate to Agent 5
8. **Item 7** (highest valuation by Agent 2): Allocate to Agent 2

### Final Allocation

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the fair division principles by allocating the items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each item is allocated exactly once.
