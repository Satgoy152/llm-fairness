Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  41  11  71  86  76  55  91
1  92  33  13   6  24  22  83  72
2  27  37  24   1  67  90  63  10
3  11  39  95  35  26  62  83   1
4  89  54  34  85  60  78  66  17
5  72  29  62  29  34  66  38   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close as possible, we need to consider each agent's preferences and ensure that no agent strongly prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We have 6 agents and 8 items, which means some agents will receive more items than others. However, our focus is to match items to agents in a way that maximizes the total value each agent gets based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the given valuations and try to allocate items accordingly:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 0 (90), 4 (86), and 7 (91).
- Agent 1 values item 0 (92) and item 6 (83) highly.
- Agent 2 values items 5 (90) and 4 (67) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 2 (95) the highest.
- Agent 4 values items 0 (89) and 3 (85) highly.
- Agent 5 values item 2 (62) and item 5 (66) the most.

A fair allocation strategy would first try to match highly valued items with agents who value them the most while ensuring all items are allocated. Let's proceed with an allocation attempt:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (valuation 92), since they value it the highest.
2. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (valuation 91), as they value it the most.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (valuation 95), given they value it the highest.
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (valuation 90), since they have the highest valuation for it.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (valuation 85), as they value it the most.
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (valuation 83), which is their second-highest valued item.
7. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (valuation 86), which is their second-highest valued item.
8. Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (valuation 54) to balance allocations, as Agent 4 receives fewer high-value items.

Now, we can present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 1],
    "5": []
}
```

In this allocation, all 8 items are distributed, and we have attempted to match high-value items to the agents who value them most while maintaining a balance. Agent 5 does not receive any items, as their highest valuations coincide with items already highly valued by others.
