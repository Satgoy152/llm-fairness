Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  84  99  85  60  37  42  40
1  91   6  19  83  55  94  12  40
2  75  82  85  23  86  11  22  16
3  68  53  60  21  87  52  29  20
4  34  53  40  46  84  45  24   0
5  48  27  39  86  33  15  15  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the principle of envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the table of valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to achieve a fair allocation.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance fairness and envy-freeness:

1. Start by determining which items are most valuable to each agent.
2. Allocate high-value items to agents who value them most, while considering the overall distribution to ensure each agent receives a fair share of total value.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (value 99), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 5 the most (value 94), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (value 86), so assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (value 68), so assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4** values item 3 the most (value 46), so assign item 3 to Agent 4.
- **Agent 5** values item 7 the most (value 45), so assign item 7 to Agent 5.

For the remaining items, allocate them to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (total value for Agent 0 = 99 + 84 = 183).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (total value for Agent 1 = 94 + 12 = 106).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they highly value, while also keeping the distribution balanced across all agents.
