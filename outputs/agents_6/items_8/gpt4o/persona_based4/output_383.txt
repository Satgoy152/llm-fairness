Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  61   3  51  28  74  19  45
1  46   8  57  21  32  90  35  93
2   5  17  22  86  95  22  10  40
3  73  98  67  25  70  46  75  92
4  94  58  35  75  30  20  32  60
5  16  62  34  54  86   8  33  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we must ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given that we have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents may receive more than one item while others may receive only one or none. Let's proceed with the allocation by examining the valuations and attempting to minimize envy.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest Valuation: Item 5 (74)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest Valuation: Item 7 (93)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest Valuation: Item 4 (95)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest Valuation: Item 1 (98)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest Valuation: Item 0 (94)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Highest Valuation: Item 4 (86) which is already allocated, next highest is Item 7 (83) which is also allocated. Next is Item 3 (54).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. Two items remain: Items 2 and 6.

7. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2 (remaining): 
     - Highest Valuation among unallocated: Agent 3 (67), Agent 1 also values it (57).
     - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.
   
   - Item 6 (remaining):
     - Highest Valuation among unallocated: Agent 3 (75), Agent 5 values it (33).
     - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, each item has been allocated. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation aims at maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
