Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  93  27   4  15  51  84  48
1  43  61  56   0  77  98  82  49
2  49  24  50  28  38  36  64  17
3  27  83  40  78  11  98  23  18
4  35  20  95  70  59  55  95  90
5  18  56   8  86  25  22  83  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy. This means that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocations of other agents. However, with a limited number of items and varying preferences, achieving perfect envy-freeness is challenging. Instead, we strive for an allocation that is as fair as possible under these constraints.

Here's a basic approach to allocate the items:

1. **Sort items based on highest valuations:** For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. **Allocate items greedily:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. **Adjust to ensure fairness:** Attempt to redistribute items to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent is not overly envious compared to others.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- Agents 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 should each receive at least one item where possible.
- Items are allocated based on the maximum valuation by any agent.

**Allocation:**

- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (78).
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 0 (93).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 4 (95).
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 5 (86).
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 1 (77).
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 1 (98).
- Item 6 is most valued by Agent 0 (84).
- Item 7 is most valued by Agent 4 (90).

Here's a proposed allocation based on the values:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value highly, while ensuring that items are distributed as fairly as possible given the constraints. Note that Agents 2 and 3 do not receive items because they do not have the highest valuation for any item, and the total number of items (8) must be respected.
