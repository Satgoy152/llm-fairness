Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  37  55  30  17   4  28  67
1  28  93   1   3  44  88  97  94
2  59  51  58  99  31  15  15  66
3  31  77  38  38  87  85  97  47
4  79  56  72  26  83  61  27  42
5  99  22   3  16  93  63  41  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute items in a way that minimizes envy and considers the valuations each agent has for the items. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item while others may receive only one or none. The goal is to allocate items in a way that agents perceive as fair based on their individual valuation matrices.

Let's begin by analyzing the values and then proceed to allocate the items, trying to achieve an envy-free allocation.

### Strategy:
1. **Highest Valuation Allocation**: Initially, allocate the item to the agent who values it the most. This is a greedy approach to maximize happiness.

2. **Adjust for Fairness**: Check if any allocation can be improved by swapping items between agents to reduce envy.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Adjust allocations to ensure exactly 8 items are distributed.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (99), allocate to agent 5.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (93), allocate to agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (55), allocate to agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (99), allocate to agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (93), allocate to agent 5.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (88), allocate to agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (97), allocate to agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (94), allocate to agent 1.

Let's see the initial allocation based on highest valuations:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 5, 6, 7]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [0, 4]

This allocation isn't entirely fair as Agent 1 has too many items while others have none. We need to adjust to ensure a fairer distribution.

### Adjusted Allocation:
- **Item 1** can be given to Agent 3 who has a relatively high valuation (77) to reduce the number of items for Agent 1.
- **Item 5** can be given to Agent 4 who has a reasonable valuation (61).

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [6, 7]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [0, 4]

This allocation distributes the items more evenly among the agents while considering their preferences.

### Final Allocation JSON:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated while attempting to minimize envy by considering agents' preferences.
