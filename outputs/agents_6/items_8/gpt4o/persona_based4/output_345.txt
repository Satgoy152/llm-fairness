Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  26  74  83  91  17  44  60
1  57  87  75  48  32  15  18   5
2  26  55  21  30  30  10  89  93
3  70  76  79  21  45  90  17  43
4  60  36  13  68  13  47  66   1
5   8  81  20  44  29  80  86  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use a mechanism like the envy-free round-robin or adjusted winner procedure, which aims to minimize envy and maximize overall satisfaction.

First, let's consider the total number of items, which is 8, and we have 6 agents. We'll try to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item and no agent receives more than two items since we have more items than agents. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Valuation for item 0 is the highest (96), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Valuation for item 1 is the highest (87), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Valuation for item 7 is the highest (93), so assign item 7 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Valuation for item 5 is the highest (90), so assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Valuation for item 6 is the highest (66), so assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5:** Valuation for item 5 is the highest (81), but it is already taken, so assign item 3, which is the next highest valuation (44) for Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. Two items are left: items 2 and 4.

7. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2: The highest remaining valuation is by Agent 3 (79), so assign item 2 to Agent 3.
   - Item 4: The highest remaining valuation is by Agent 0 (91), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, with the aim of minimizing envy based on the highest valuations.
