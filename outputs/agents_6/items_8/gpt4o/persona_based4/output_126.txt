Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  97  43  85  29  35  76  55
1  17  13  92  97  25  82   2  76
2  12  49  24  99  37   8  20  22
3   6  43  92  33  26   3  26  89
4  57  45  81   0  19  69  92  59
5  92  54  33  78  97  97  58  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, we can use a method that ensures each agent's allocation is as fair as possible. One common approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation, which seeks to minimize the maximum envy among agents.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 1 the most (97). 
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 3 the most (97).
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 3 the most as well, but since it's already taken, we'll allocate their second preference, item 0 (12).
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 the most (92).
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 6 the most (92).
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 0 the most (92), but since it's taken, we'll allocate their next highest preference, item 4 (97).

Now, let's look at the remaining items and fairly distribute them among the agents:

- **Items Left**: 5, 7, and 2 (since 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6 are allocated).

**Allocate remaining items:**

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 2.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 6.
- **Agent 5**: Already has item 4.

We need to allocate items 5 and 7:

- **Agent 0**: Item 7 is valued at 55, which is their next preference.
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 is valued at 82, which is their next preference.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible and all 8 items are allocated.
