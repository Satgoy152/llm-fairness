Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  72  58  82  17  35  62  46
1  71  10  44   1  90  92  70   4
2  53  18  44  90  72  67  54  60
3   8  28  94  12  45  90  59  16
4  78  24  44  43  53  90   9  31
5  60  15  73  40  44   6   6  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible. We aim to give each agent the items they value most while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Let's look at the valuations and try to assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is Item 3 (82). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is Item 5 (92). Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is Item 3 (90), but since it's already taken, we assign the next highest, which is Item 4 (72).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is Item 2 (94). Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is Item 0 (78). Assign Item 0 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for Agent 5 is Item 2 (73), but it's already taken, so we assign the next highest, Item 0 (60), which is also taken. We continue checking until we find Item 4 (44) available.

After these initial allocations, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

7. Since Agent 0 only has one item, we can assign them another high-value item such as Item 6 (62) which is not taken.
8. Lastly, assign the remaining item, Item 7, to Agent 1 since it has a higher valuation than others' remaining top choices.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation while ensuring all items are distributed.
