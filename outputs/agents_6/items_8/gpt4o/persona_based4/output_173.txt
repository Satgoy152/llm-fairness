Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  18  16  74  85  77  42  62
1  69  36  29  98  87   1  56  60
2  79  35  15  58  90   4  60  17
3  25  69  24  56  37  51  38  29
4  25  22  51  39  45  68  46  91
5  99  68  42  47  57  51  41  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the "maximum marginal utility" rule, which assigns items to agents based on who values them the most. This can help ensure envy-freeness, where no agent feels another has received a better allocation.

Let's go through the allocation step by step:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from Agent 5 (value 99). Assign item 0 to Agent 5.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from Agent 3 (value 69). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from Agent 4 (value 51). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from Agent 1 (value 98). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (value 90). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (value 77). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (value 60). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is from Agent 4 (value 91). Assign item 7 to Agent 4.

The allocation is done with the goal of ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly, reducing envy among agents. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value most highly, aiming for an envy-free distribution.
