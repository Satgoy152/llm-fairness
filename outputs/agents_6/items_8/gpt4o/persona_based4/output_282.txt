Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  88  52  26  82  89  93  78
1  20  80   4  44  48  46  14  22
2  92  35   3   0  59  94  82  45
3  71  93  39  65  30  26  89  16
4  87   2  82  37  12  82  69   2
5  49  67  69  62  31  33  45  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim to minimize envy among the agents and distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 6 agents and 8 items, two agents will receive two items each, and the other four agents will receive one item each. Let's proceed with the allocation by considering the valuations provided in the table.

We will use a simple approach that involves allocating items based on maximizing individual agent's valuations for each item, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Identify the highest value each agent has for any item**: This helps in ensuring that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.
2. **Allocate items based on the highest unallocated value for each agent**: Start with the agent who has the highest value for any unallocated item and assign that item to them.
3. **Repeat the process until all items are allocated**: Ensure that each agent gets an item, and then allocate the remaining items to the agents with the next highest valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Agent 2** has the highest value of 94 for item 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 3** has a high value of 93 for item 1. Allocate item 1 to agent 3.
3. **Agent 0** has a high value of 93 for item 6. Allocate item 6 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** has a high value of 80 for item 1, but it's already allocated. The next highest is 48 for item 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 1.
5. **Agent 4** has a high value of 87 for item 0. Allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has a high value of 80 for item 7. Allocate item 7 to agent 5.
7. Now, two items are left: 2 and 3.
8. Agent 0 has the highest remaining value of 52 for item 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
9. The last item, item 3, goes to the next highest valuation agent, which is **Agent 5** with a valuation of 62. Allocate item 3 to agent 5.

### Final Allocations:
Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one of their highly valued items and ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
