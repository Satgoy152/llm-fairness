Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  98  94  97   9  33  58  56
1  64  37  22  12  51  36  94  96
2  47  85  91  14  25  35  73  77
3  95   7  45  73  51  25  91  54
4  28  72  76  34  61  75  54  34
5  33  11  60  86  78  35  33  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [33 11 60 86 78 35 33 23]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations table, we can attempt to allocate the items in such a way that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values items 0, 1, 2, and 3 highly, so we can allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest, so we allocate item 7 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values items 2 and 6 highly, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest, but it is already allocated, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the highest, so we allocate item 5 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the highest, so we allocate item 4 to agent 5.

We have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. The remaining item, 6, can be allocated to agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their individual valuations.
