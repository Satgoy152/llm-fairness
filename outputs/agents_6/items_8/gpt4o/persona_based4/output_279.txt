Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  19  57   8  46  82  98   7
1   6  86  39  49  65  38  22  39
2  59  56  61  87  78  96  77  45
3  15  32   9  30  10  30  75  10
4  56  97   9  62  10  16  66  85
5  10  97  90  46  24  45  92  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible by considering each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's start the allocation process by considering each agent's valuations and trying to distribute items according to where they have the highest value, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here's a step-by-step attempt to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for item 6 (98). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 1 (86). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 5 (96). Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 6, but it's already taken, so next best is item 5, but that's also taken, so allocate item 0 (15) to Agent 3, considering the least envy.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 1, but it's taken; next is item 7 (85). Allocate item 7 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation for item 1, but it's taken; next is item 2 (90). Allocate item 2 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 out of 8 items. Let's allocate the remaining 2 items:

7. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (65) is still available and is the next highest preference. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 1**: Next available item is item 3 (49). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This distribution attempts to minimize envy by assigning items where agents have high valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible.
