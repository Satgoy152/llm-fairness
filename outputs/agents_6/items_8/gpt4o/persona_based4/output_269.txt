Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  30   9  29  87  37  53  46
1  26   2  56  21  78  58  86  82
2  77  92  56  72  27  12  42   1
3   1  61  40  10  90  64  35  38
4  73  25   1  16  12  58   9  97
5  24  67  25  73  83  77  47  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we'll need to use a method that considers the valuations of each agent for each item. One approach is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns selecting their most preferred item that is still available. However, since we only have 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will end up with more items than others, but we can still aim to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

Below is a suggested allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (87), Item 6 (53)
   - Allocated: Item 4
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (86), Item 7 (82)
   - Allocated: Item 6, Item 7
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (92), Item 0 (77)
   - Allocated: Item 1, Item 0
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (90), Item 5 (64)
   - Allocated: Item 5
   
5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest values: Item 7 (97)
   - Allocated: None
   
6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (77), Item 4 (83)
   - Allocated: Item 2, Item 3

This allocation attempts to give each agent their most valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```
