Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  15  73  93  18  97  54  82
1  76  33  24  39  59  34  97  87
2  76  66  17  59  43   2   2  64
3  13  54  50  73  67  46  11  11
4  55  29  86  80  46  82  29  77
5  34  28  31  97  73  43  99  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents to minimize envy, we should aim for a distribution where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value any other agent's allocation. This is a complex problem, and achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can attempt to make it as fair as possible under the circumstances.

The strategy here will be to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction, considering their valuations. We'll start by examining each agent's highest-valued items and try to distribute them in a way that attempts to balance the overall perceived value.

Let's break it down:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 3 (93) and 5 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 6 (97) and 7 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 0 (76) and 1 (66).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 3 (73) and 4 (67).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 2 (86) and 5 (82).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest values are for items 6 (99) and 3 (97).

Given these preferences, we'll attempt to allocate the items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item they highly value and trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [6]
- **Agent 2**: [1]
- **Agent 3**: [3]
- **Agent 4**: [2]
- **Agent 5**: [4, 7]

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they highly value, though it may not eliminate envy entirely. The goal was to distribute the items so that each agent receives a reasonable total valuation.
