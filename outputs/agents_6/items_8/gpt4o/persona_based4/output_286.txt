Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  23   6  85  29  77  68  39
1  69  24  98  36  68  55   3  50
2  45  50   5  72  69  76  39  30
3  73  32  22  33  52   7  21  53
4  34  42  34  72  10  21   1   9
5  57  33   1  94  79  78  49  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method called "round-robin" allocation, which helps ensure that each agent gets a fair chance based on their preferences. The goal is to achieve a fair division that minimizes envy, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items to agents:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item. Allocate that item to the agent if it hasn't been allocated yet.
2. If an agent's top choice is already taken, move on to their next highest valued item.
3. Continue this process until all 8 items are allocated.

Following these steps, the allocation would be as follows:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 3 (85).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 2 (98).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5 (76).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 0 (73).
- Agent 4 doesn't have a strong preference for any remaining item, so we look at the next highest untaken item, which gives them item 1.
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 4 (79).
- This leaves items 6 and 7, which can be allocated to the agents with the next highest preferences for them.

Continuing this allocation pattern, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, minimizing envy and ensuring a fair distribution.
