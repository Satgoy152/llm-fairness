Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  84  57  84  82  24  15  81
1  55  15  21  52  74  19  73  21
2  47  48  43  20  36  11  23  36
3  98  47  54  26  57  27  22  16
4   0  31  84  40  89  69  70  31
5  17  83  94  61  79  44  67  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents with respect to their valuations, we can aim to satisfy the condition of envy-freeness as much as possible. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over any other's, based on their own valuations.

Considering the given valuations, we can follow a methodical approach to allocate the items:

1. **Highest-Valuation Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This helps in reducing envy since each agent gets items they value highly.

2. **Balancing Allocations**: Ensure that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items (in this case, one or two items each, since there are 8 items and 6 agents).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (98).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (84).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (94).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (84). However, to balance allocations, assign to Agent 1 (52).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (89).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (69). However, to balance allocations, assign to Agent 0 (24).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (73).
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (81). To balance allocations, assign to Agent 2 (36).

After these steps, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 2

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation leverages high valuations to minimize potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
