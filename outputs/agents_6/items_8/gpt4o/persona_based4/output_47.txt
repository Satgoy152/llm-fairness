Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  88  70  46  15  73  43  38
1  65  61  27  59  71  34  45  10
2  80  76  66  86  87  41  51   2
3  30  25  15  91  53  91  37  71
4  41   8  17  82  60  83  33  85
5  76  84  32  42  24  37  43  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, given their own valuation. With 6 agents and 8 items, we aim for an allocation where no agent envies another.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Determine Total Valuations:**
   - Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their overall preference.
   
2. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items based on priority to maximize each agent's satisfaction and try to balance the total value received by each agent.

3. **Iterative Adjustments:**
   - Adjust allocations to minimize envy by considering each agent's most valued items that have not yet been allocated.

Let's calculate the total valuations first and then proceed with allocations that aim to balance these totals:

#### Total Valuations per Agent
- Agent 0: \( 57 + 88 + 70 + 46 + 15 + 73 + 43 + 38 = 430 \)
- Agent 1: \( 65 + 61 + 27 + 59 + 71 + 34 + 45 + 10 = 372 \)
- Agent 2: \( 80 + 76 + 66 + 86 + 87 + 41 + 51 + 2 = 489 \)
- Agent 3: \( 30 + 25 + 15 + 91 + 53 + 91 + 37 + 71 = 413 \)
- Agent 4: \( 41 + 8 + 17 + 82 + 60 + 83 + 33 + 85 = 409 \)
- Agent 5: \( 76 + 84 + 32 + 42 + 24 + 37 + 43 + 93 = 431 \)

#### Allocation Strategy:
- We will allocate items based on each agent's highest valuations while ensuring that the sum of allocations covers all items.

#### Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: [1, 5] (values: 88, 73)
- **Agent 1**: [4] (value: 71)
- **Agent 2**: [0] (value: 80)
- **Agent 3**: [3] (value: 91)
- **Agent 4**: [7] (value: 85)
- **Agent 5**: [2, 6] (values: 32, 43)

This allocation aims to balance the valuations each agent receives, considering their preferences and ensuring a fair distribution based on their highest-valued items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```
