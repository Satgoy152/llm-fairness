Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  38  80  74  55  46  85  58
1  21  91  57  32  95  92  56  29
2  48  81  63  93  51  28  53  96
3  93  55  39  76  86  23  27  19
4  92  65  68  59  38   7  86  28
5  66  44   4  89  25  29  58   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while taking into account the valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use methods from fair division theory like the adjusted winner procedure, envy-free matching, or the maximin method. However, since this is a relatively small problem, we can use a more straightforward approach by balancing the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is a possible allocation that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and minimize envy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Here's an allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items [2, 3] (values: 80, 74)
2. Agent 1: Items [1, 4] (values: 91, 95)
3. Agent 2: Items [0, 7] (values: 48, 96)
4. Agent 3: Items [5] (value: 23)
5. Agent 4: Items [6] (value: 86)
6. Agent 5: Items [] (no items allocated)

Now, presenting this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets a reasonable share of items based on their valuations, and all items are distributed. Note that achieving complete envy-freeness can be particularly challenging with integer allocations and may not be possible in this setup.
