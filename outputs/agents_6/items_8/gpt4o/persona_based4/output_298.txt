Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  78  13  77  98  31  39  61
1  62  88  63  40  90  43  46  53
2  73  66  72   1  71  89   4  55
3  96  45  42  46  23  62  47  97
4  48  15  66  36  93  23  94  85
5  25   5  24  83  42  86  72  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an approach that seeks to maximize each agent's total satisfaction and minimize envy. Given the constraints of this problem, we aim to distribute the items to the agents such that each agent receives a set of items maximizing their perceived value.

One potential way to achieve this is to use a greedy round-robin algorithm, where each agent, in turn, selects the most valuable item available to them. This process continues until all items are allocated.

Below is a step-by-step allocation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (98) and 3 (77). Assign item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (88) and 4 (90, but already assigned). Assign item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (89) and 2 (72). Assign item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (96) and 7 (97). Assign item 7.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (93, but already assigned) and 6 (94). Assign item 6.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (83) and 5 (86, but already assigned). Assign item 3.
7. **Agent 0 (again)**: Remaining items are 0, 2, 5. Assign item 2 (next highest for Agent 0).
8. **Agent 1 (again)**: Remaining items are 0, 5. Assign item 0 (next highest for Agent 1).

Let's summarize the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent is satisfied based on their highest available valuations while maintaining envy-freeness as much as possible.
