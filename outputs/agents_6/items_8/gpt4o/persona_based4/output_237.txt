Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  28  82  59   4  83  63  18
1  61  30  28  38  77  70  17  49
2  42  72   2  49  94  44  67  84
3  26  60  92  10  49  73  14  12
4   2  79  72  25  70  53  85  28
5   0   5  94  39  12  47  66  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels that they received a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach is to attempt to equalize the perceived value of each agent's allocation.

Here is a possible allocation ensuring each agent gets at least one item while trying to keep the allocations fair:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (98) and item 2 (82). Allocating these items to Agent 0 gives them a high total value.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (77) and item 5 (70) significantly. Assigning these items to Agent 1 provides a good perceived value.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 (84) and item 6 (67). Assigning these items to Agent 2 maximizes their satisfaction.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 (92) highly, but it's already taken. The next best is item 5 (73), which is also taken. Assign item 1 (60) and item 3 (10).
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 (85) and item 1 (79) highly, but they are already taken. Assign item 3 (25) and item 4 (70).
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 (94) highly, but it's already taken. Assign item 6 (66) and item 7 (53).

Using this approach, the allocation is as follows, ensuring that each agent receives a perceived fair share:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation considers the highest remaining value items for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. However, if precise envy-freeness is required, further adjustments might be necessary, potentially involving more complex algorithms or re-evaluation of remaining values.
