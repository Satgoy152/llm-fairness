Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66   3  31  21  31  75  31  98
1  76  11  97  32  50  55  72  26
2  67  14  84  14  50  54   3  50
3  18  51  33  90  25  91  89  26
4  96  26  31  80  97  58  94  60
5  16  73   2  15  74  14  46  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a division that minimizes envy and potentially meets the envy-freeness criteria. Given the complex nature of envy-freeness and the fact that perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable with integer allocations and distinct valuations, we will proceed with a reasonable allocation strategy that tries to distribute the perceived value as evenly as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Sum the valuations of all items for each agent.

2. **Determine Fair Shares:** The fair share for each agent is ideally the total valuation divided by the number of agents. However, since we are dealing with indivisible items, we will aim to approximate this.

3. **Allocate Items:** Distribute items to agents in such a way that each agent's total perceived value is as close as possible to their fair share. We will prioritize giving each agent items they value highly first, while ensuring all items are allocated.

4. **Adjustments for Fairness:** Since perfect fairness might not be possible, we will adjust allocations to minimize the largest deviations from the fair share.

Below is the allocation based on the above principles:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived values across agents while considering their individual preferences. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
