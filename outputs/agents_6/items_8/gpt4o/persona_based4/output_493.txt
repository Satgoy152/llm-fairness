Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  84  97  70  22  52  94  36
1  41  28  70  43  94  31  61  86
2  15  33  56  98  11  64  56   0
3  77  47  92   4  13  62  54  24
4  34  89  21  11  47  27   8  93
5  38  89  86  19  72  58   0  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that ensures envy-freeness, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for the items and allocate them in a way that minimizes envy among agents. Given the provided valuations, one effective approach is to use a round-robin allocation or a maximization algorithm that takes into account the total value assigned to each agent.

Let's attempt a round-robin approach where each agent selects their most valued item until all items are allocated. We will iterate through the agents, allowing each to pick their highest-valued available item that hasn't yet been taken.

1. **Agent 0** picks item 6 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 4 (value 94).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 3 (value 98).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 2 (value 92).
5. **Agent 4** picks item 7 (value 93).
6. **Agent 5** picks item 1 (value 89).
7. **Agent 0** picks item 5 (value 52).
8. **Agent 1** picks item 7 (already taken, next highest available item is item 3, already taken, next is item 5, already taken, so they pick item 0 with highest available value of 41).

This allocation should ensure no agent feels envy, as they are picking according to their preferences. Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible, and if not possible due to item limitations, they at least have had a fair chance based on their valuations.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets items based on their highest preferences in a fair and envy-free manner.
