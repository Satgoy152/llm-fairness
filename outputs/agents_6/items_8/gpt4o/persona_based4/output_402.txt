Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  24  47  35  45  34  54  29
1  51  94   5  83  79  72  84  88
2  31  81  41  12  18   2  13  92
3  76   7  70   6  67   8  82  30
4  90   2   9  13  14  80  63  64
5  22  88  44  60  10  86  72  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation or minimizing envy among agents. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. However, achieving strict envy-freeness with indivisible items can be challenging. Here, we aim to distribute the items to maximize fairness and minimize envy.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix and make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation on item 6 (54) and item 2 (47).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on item 1 (94) and item 7 (88).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation on item 7 (92) and item 1 (81).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation on item 0 (76) and item 6 (82).
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation on item 0 (90) and item 5 (80).
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation on item 5 (86) and item 1 (88).

To balance these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3 (valuations: 47, 35)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 4 (valuations: 94, 79)
- **Agent 2**: Item 7 (valuation: 92)
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (valuation: 82)
- **Agent 4**: Item 0 (valuation: 90)
- **Agent 5**: Item 5 (valuation: 86)

This allocation ensures each agent receives some item(s) and aims to minimize envy by matching high valuations with allocated items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
