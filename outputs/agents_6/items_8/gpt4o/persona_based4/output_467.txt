Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  13  76  21  16  22  39  88
1  32  96  60  66  83  62  63  62
2  62  22  11  32  40   7   4  30
3  33  95  97  34  14  40   7  75
4  19  47  94  17  32  30   3  41
5   4   8  35  42  77  82  15  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to ensure that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. This is a challenging problem, especially with integer constraints, but we can attempt to achieve a balanced distribution.

Let's evaluate the problem:

1. There are 6 agents and 8 items. 
2. Each agent has a distinct valuation for each item, and our goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible.

We'll use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items:

- Start by ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
- Attempt to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is balanced.
- In case of conflicts, prioritize giving items to agents with the least total value.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 is allocated item 0.
2. Agent 1 is allocated item 1.
3. Agent 2 is allocated item 5.
4. Agent 3 is allocated items 2 and 7.
5. Agent 4 is allocated item 3.
6. Agent 5 is allocated items 4 and 6.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items among the agents while considering their preferences and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
