Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84   9  61  84  68  96  17  13
1  28  10  81   9  88  51  27  69
2  67  67  31   6  84  29  30  25
3  13  99  12  59  39  36  24   6
4  28   3  73  75  16   5  49  30
5  39  39  84  99  58   5  73  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that maximizes total satisfaction while attempting to achieve some measure of fairness, such as minimizing envy among the agents. The goal is to distribute items so that each agent feels they have received their fair share. We will consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and try to balance these valuations across all agents. Here, we'll attempt to find a balanced allocation.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued items are 0, 3, and 5. We'll give items 0 and 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued items are 2, 4, and 7. We'll assign items 2 and 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued items are 0, 1, and 4. Since item 0 is already allocated, we'll assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued item is 1, however, it's already allocated. We'll assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valued items are 3 and 2. We'll assign item 6 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valued items are 3 and 2. We'll assign item 7 to agent 5.

By reviewing the allocation, we can make adjustments to balance envy. Let's ensure that all items are assigned fairly. Hereâ€™s the finalized allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Each agent receives items that are among their top preferences, helping to minimize envy and maximize perceived fairness.
