Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  99  59  70  42  22   8  56
1  68  31  93   2  19  22  42  15
2  24  30  18  18  41  31  61  98
3  27  38  62  79  93  25  20  18
4  73  73  67  44   2  53  32  91
5  82  23  87  15  82  17  15   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to take into account the valuations of each item by each agent. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total allocation of items is exactly 8. In addition, we aim to minimize envy among agents by ensuring that each agent values their allocation as highly as possible.

Let's first examine the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [5, 99, 59, 70, 42, 22, 8, 56]
Agent 1: [68, 31, 93, 2, 19, 22, 42, 15]
Agent 2: [24, 30, 18, 18, 41, 31, 61, 98]
Agent 3: [27, 38, 62, 79, 93, 25, 20, 18]
Agent 4: [73, 73, 67, 44, 2, 53, 32, 91]
Agent 5: [82, 23, 87, 15, 82, 17, 15, 7]
```

Next, we will try to allocate items such that the highest preference for each item guides the allocation, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that exactly 8 items are allocated.

The resulting allocation is:

- Item 0: Agent 5 (82)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (99)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (93)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (79)
- Item 4: Agent 3 (93)
- Item 5: Agent 4 (53)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (61)
- Item 7: Agent 2 (98)

Let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 1
- Agent 1 receives item 2
- Agent 2 receives items 6 and 7
- Agent 3 receives items 3 and 4
- Agent 4 receives item 5
- Agent 5 receives item 0

Every agent receives items, and all 8 items are allocated. Now presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```
