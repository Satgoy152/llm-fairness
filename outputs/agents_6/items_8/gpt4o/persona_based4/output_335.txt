Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  29  87  85  34  37  48  30
1  64  92  51  99  29  82  48  15
2  67  99  47  61   4  25  49  89
3  65  44  13  54  62  54  67  67
4  98  48  88  15  35  22  86   5
5  30   7  95  51  98  91   9  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free and efficient. One approach is to use the method of “Envy-Free up to One Item” (EF1), which seeks to make each agent as happy as possible given the constraints. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer another agent's bundle over their own, except possibly by removing one item from the other agent’s bundle.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 2 and 3 have the highest valuations for Agent 0. Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 2. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Items 6 and 4 are more preferable. Allocate items 6 and 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Item 0 is most valuable to Agent 4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items with high personal valuations, minimizing envy and ensuring efficiency.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6, 4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
