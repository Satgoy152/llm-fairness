Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33   3  46  86   8  60  38  11
1  28  72  49  97  89  42  41  33
2  63  24  30   4  33  32  25  71
3  30  25  56  25   7  61   6  81
4   6  95  75  73  10  67  43  66
5  64   0  54  89  79  61  38  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we must ensure that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. This can be challenging, but we can aim for a fair distribution based on the valuations provided.

Given the table, let's try to allocate items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (86). We can allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (97), but since item 3 is already taken, we can allocate item 4 (89) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (63). We can allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 the most (81). We can allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 the most (95). We can allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 the most (64), but since item 0 is already taken, we can allocate item 5 (61) to Agent 5.

Now, the remaining items are 2 and 6. We need to allocate these to the agents to ensure each agent receives at least one item where possible, and to reduce potential envy:

- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values item 2 the most among the remaining agents (56). Since Agent 3 already has item 7, adding item 2 will not cause them to envy another's allocation.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values item 6 the most among the remaining agents (38). Adding item 6 to Agent 0's allocation will not cause them to envy another's allocation.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and ensure each agent has at least one item where feasible. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7, 2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an allocation that aims to minimize potential envy based on their valuations.
