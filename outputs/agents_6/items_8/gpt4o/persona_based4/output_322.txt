Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  83  57  54  59  12  45  97
1  10  53  47  96  24  50  86  99
2  34   2  53  26  58  35  49  89
3  81  76  30  61  79  65  38  40
4  27  87  52  30  55  87  74  35
5  44  77  24   4   9  23  73  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we'll aim to minimize the envy any agent might feel towards another. One approach is to use a round-robin allocation method based on the agents' preferences. We can start by assigning each agent the item they value the most that hasn't been allocated yet, continuing this process until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 7 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 7 (99), but item 7 is taken. Next highest is item 3 (96).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 7 (89), but item 7 is taken. Next highest is item 4 (58).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 0 (81).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 1 (87).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 7 (98), but item 7 is taken. Next highest is item 1 (77), but item 1 is taken. Next highest is item 5 (73).

Continue with the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest available item is 2 (57).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest available item is 6 (86).
- **Agent 2**: Next highest available item is 5 (35), but item 5 is taken. Next is item 2 (53), but item 2 is taken. Next is item 6 (49), but item 6 is taken. Finally, item 3 (26) is left.
- **Agent 3**: Next highest available item is 4 (79), but item 4 is taken. Next is item 5 (65), but item 5 is taken. Next is item 6 (38), but item 6 is taken. Next is item 7 (40), but item 7 is taken. Finally, item 3 (61) is left.

After this allocation, all items are assigned:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items based on their highest remaining valuations, ensuring a fair distribution while minimizing envy.
