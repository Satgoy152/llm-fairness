Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75   4  10  83  75   9  55  36
1  36  22  12  65   3  76  25   8
2  22  50  89   0  68   7  47   7
3  46  18  11  59  22  67  31   2
4  75  68  66  15  99  66  50  19
5   4  34  70  74  89  51  73   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on every item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received their fair share based on their valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Strategy:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent**: 
   - This helps us understand the overall value perception of each agent and guides us in ensuring no agent feels envious.

2. **Sort Items by Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Identify which items each agent values the most.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - Prioritize allocating high-value items to agents to maximize their individual satisfaction.
   - Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, to prevent any feelings of exclusion.
   - Attempt to balance allocations so no single agent receives a disproportionately high-value collection compared to others.

4. **Adjust for Fairness**:
   - After initial allocation, adjust if any agent feels envious by potentially swapping items or reallocating.

### Calculations:

- **Total Valuations for Each Agent**:
  - Agent 0: 347
  - Agent 1: 247
  - Agent 2: 290
  - Agent 3: 256
  - Agent 4: 458
  - Agent 5: 401

Based on these valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

### Allocation:
- Assign items starting from the highest value each agent has, ensuring a balanced distribution.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],       // Values: 83, 10
    "1": [5, 0],       // Values: 76, 36
    "2": [4],          // Value: 68
    "3": [6],          // Value: 31
    "4": [1],          // Value: 68
    "5": [7]           // Value: 6
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Agent 0** receives items [3, 2] which are valued at 93 in total.
- **Agent 1** receives items [5, 0] which are valued at 112 in total.
- **Agent 2** receives item [4] which is valued at 68.
- **Agent 3** receives item [6] which is valued at 31.
- **Agent 4** receives item [1] which is valued at 68.
- **Agent 5** receives item [7] which is valued at 6.

This allocation attempts to balance both the number of items and the total value as perceived by each agent, aiming to ensure that no agent feels disproportionately envious of another's allocation.
