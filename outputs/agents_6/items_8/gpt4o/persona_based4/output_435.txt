Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  95  47  74  58  26   5  92
1  56  50  11  12  26  44  32   7
2  41  26  84  17  84  52  99  53
3  88  32   2  40  52   4  52  78
4  43  19  70  87  27  50  82  92
5  59  50   0  71  95  64  22  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that is as envy-free as possible, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, we can use a simple heuristic to assign items based on each agent's strongest preference, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on optimizing each agent's highest value preference:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (95).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (56) after agent 0's choice.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (99).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (88), but since it's taken, they value item 7 (78).
5. **Agent 4** has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 (87).
6. **Agent 5** has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (95).

Now, let's assign the remaining items, considering the next highest preferences:

7. **Agent 2** can also value item 2 (84), given that it is their next preference.
8. **Agent 5** can also take item 5 (64), which is their next best available choice.

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value preferences among the agents as evenly as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items while trying to maintain fairness based on their valuations.
