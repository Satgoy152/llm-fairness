Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  19  58  94  39  62  23  14
1  84  73  60  31  34  87  77  97
2  70  29  73  61  46  99  85  88
3  33   0  36  54  79  46  53  76
4  36  41   6  65  39   7  44   3
5  83  34  67  89  49  85   7  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll use a method based on maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We aim to minimize envy by allocating items such that each agent receives a comparable value according to their personal valuations. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm which assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Given the valuations, let's assign the items:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item to ensure everyone receives at least one item.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Continue assigning the remaining items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Step 1**: Assign each agent their highest valued item:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 94)
   - Agent 1: Item 7 (value 97)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 99)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (value 79)
   - Agent 4: Item 3 (value 65), but already taken, so next highest is Item 4 (value 39)
   - Agent 5: Item 3 (value 89), but already taken, so next highest is Item 5 (value 85), but already taken, so next highest is Item 2 (value 67)

   Initial allocation:
   - Agent 0: [3]
   - Agent 1: [7]
   - Agent 2: [5]
   - Agent 3: [4]
   - Agent 4: [4], but already taken, so remain empty for now
   - Agent 5: [2]

2. **Step 2**: Allocate remaining items:
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 6
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 84)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (value 85)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (value 19)

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [3, 1]
- Agent 1: [7, 0]
- Agent 2: [5, 6]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [] (no remaining items to allocate)
- Agent 5: [2]

Presenting the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [7, 0],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2]
}
```
