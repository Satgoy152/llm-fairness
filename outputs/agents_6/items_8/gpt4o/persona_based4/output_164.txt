Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  22   8  43  87  50  63  67
1  64  31  96   1   7  68  44  39
2  53  86  39  58  79  28  30  99
3  95   3  13  75  27  67  28  81
4  86  64  43  29  73  66  96  30
5  54  81  91  58   9  25  77  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy. A common approach is to use an envy-free allocation method, such as the adjusted winner procedure, although this problem requires an integer allocation. 

Here's a step-by-step process for a potential solution:

1. **Identify the Valuations:** 
   First, check each agent's total valuation for the items to understand their preferences.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   Start by allocating items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   Reallocate items if necessary to minimize envy, trying to ensure each agent feels they received a fair share relative to their valuation.

4. **Check Total Items:**
   Ensure exactly 8 items are allocated.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 2 most.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 0 most.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 1 highly.

Considering these preferences and aiming to balance the allocation, here is a fair division:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items they highly value, and the total number of items allocated is 8. This should help reduce envy and ensure a fair distribution based on individual valuations.
