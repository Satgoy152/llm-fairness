Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  28  58  21  12  93  63  73
1  28  86   9  76  60  64  10  76
2   7  78  54  99  57  32  71  79
3  22  47  82  31  84  98  68  86
4  29  45  45   0  47  94  27  31
5  61  40  24  39  44  93  49  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to balance the distribution of total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Given that there are 6 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally receive at least one item, with two agents receiving an additional item each. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent:**
   - Determine the sum of values each agent assigns to all items. This provides a sense of how much value each agent perceives in the total set of items.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Distribute items to agents in a manner that attempts to balance the total perceived value among the agents. Aim for an allocation where no agent feels envious, meaning no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

3. **Adjustments for Fairness:**
   - If initial allocations lead to significant envy or imbalances, make adjustments by swapping items between agents to minimize envy and ensure a reasonably equitable distribution of perceived value.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item and that exactly 8 items are distributed.

After performing these calculations and adjustments, here is a fair allocation of items among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value based on their individual valuations, while also adhering to the constraints provided (allocating exactly 8 items among 6 agents).
