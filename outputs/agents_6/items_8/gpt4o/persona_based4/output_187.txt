Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  62  42  98  18  48  79  65
1  69  71   9  88  54  21  24  97
2  47  49  60   7  38  41  50  90
3  97   7  42  73  25  44  42   4
4  56  52  16  70  63  37  68   8
5  16  29  87  58  56  43  48  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents that minimizes envy, we can use the Max-Min Fairness approach. This approach involves allocating items to maximize the minimum valuation any agent has for their allocated set of items. Here's one way to do this:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (value 98) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 7 (value 97) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (value 60) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 0 (value 97) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 6 (value 68) to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Assign item 5 (value 43) to Agent 5.

After assigning these items, we have allocated 6 items. The remaining 2 items need to be distributed fairly.

7. **Agent 4**: Assign item 4 (value 63) to Agent 4.
8. **Agent 5**: Assign item 1 (value 29) to Agent 5.

This allocation is designed to maximize the minimum value each agent gets, ensuring a fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6, 4],
    "5": [5, 1]
}
```
