Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  67  32  80   6  35  89  82
1  46  85  57  12  67  74  63   8
2  38  52  43  39  72  43  42  65
3  34  10  66  40  42   0  50  81
4   8  72  48   1  86  54  96   2
5  52  22  75  82  93  38  48  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division, if possible, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 very highly, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the most, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 7 the most, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 the most, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 5, their next highest valued item.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 5 the most, but since it's taken, we allocate item 4, their second highest valued, which is also taken. Thus, we allocate item 2, their third highest valued item.

To fill out the allocation, we distribute the remaining items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 5, who values it reasonably.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, which Agent 0 values second highest after item 6.

This distribution considers each agent's highest preferences while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```
