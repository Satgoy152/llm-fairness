Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  16  83  76  39  77  54  30
1  15  71  41  33  37  29  29  21
2   6  86  34  50   2  19  23  30
3  86   4  91  28  82  19  39  80
4  60  17  91  35  28  12  79  84
5  14  59  24  29  52  54  80  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among agents, given their valuations of the items. One possible approach is to allocate items in such a way that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their total valuation, while ensuring the allocation remains fair.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value item 2 (83) and item 5 (77). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: They highly value item 1 (71). Assign this item to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: They highly value item 1 (86) and item 3 (50). Item 1 is already taken, so assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: They highly value item 0 (86), item 2 (91), and item 7 (80). Item 2 is already taken, so assign item 0 and item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: They highly value item 2 (91) and item 7 (84). Both items are already taken. Assign item 6 (79) to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: They highly value item 7 (87) and item 6 (80). Both are already taken. Assign item 4 (52) to Agent 5.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 0, 7
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and the agents receive items they value relatively highly, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
