Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  46  67  18  43  17  58  70
1  91  57  95  32  21  14  69  90
2  85   3   9  40  21  59  32  70
3  55  22  34  94  46  44  42  41
4  80  55  34  11  63  72  53  46
5  26  91  43  62  55  76  82   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will perform a careful analysis of the agents' valuations and distribute the items accordingly. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (72), item 2 (67), and item 7 (70).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (91), item 2 (95), and item 7 (90).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (85) and item 7 (70).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (94).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 5 (72).
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 1 (91) and item 6 (82).

Given these observations, we can attempt to allocate items by selecting the highest valued items for each agent where possible, balancing the total valuations each agent receives:

- **Agent 1**: Receives item 2 (95) and item 7 (90) because they have very high valuations for these items.
- **Agent 3**: Receives item 3 (94) because they have the highest valuation for this item.
- **Agent 4**: Receives item 5 (72) where they have a high valuation.
- **Agent 5**: Receives item 1 (91) and item 6 (82) because they highly value these items.
- **Agent 0**: Receives item 0 (72) where they have a high valuation.
- **Agent 2**: Receives item 4 (21), which is a remaining item that fits their remaining high valuation profile.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items while ensuring every item is allocated.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents while considering their preferences and attempting to maintain fairness and envy-freeness.
