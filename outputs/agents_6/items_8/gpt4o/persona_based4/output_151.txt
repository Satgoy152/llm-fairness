Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  67  93  49  36  24  43  24
1   4  67  52  23  83  85  57  51
2  71  14  52   7  35  92  66  30
3  85  12  52  14  78  73  31  59
4  47  87  54  59  37   4  90  88
5  17  29   8  78  72  14  57  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which maximizes the product of the agents' utilities. The MNW solution tends to balance fairness and efficiency and often results in an envy-free allocation when possible.

The goal is to allocate all 8 items among 6 agents such that:

1. Each agent receives an integer number of items.
2. No items are left unallocated.
3. The allocation aims to minimize envy among the agents.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the product of utilities:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are highest for item 2 (93). Assign item 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for item 5 (85). Assign item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for item 5 (92), but already taken. Assign item 6 (66).
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for item 0 (85). Assign item 0.
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are highest for item 1 (87). Assign item 1.
6. **Agent 5**: Valuations are highest for item 7 (93). Assign item 7.

The remaining items, 3 and 4, need to be allocated:

- **Agent 1**: After considering remaining items, item 4 (83) is best.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (14) as it increases utility without taking from others.

The allocation aims to balance and maximize individual utilities while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7]
}
```

Each agent has been assigned items to optimize their preferences as evenly as possible, considering the constraints.
