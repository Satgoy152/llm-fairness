Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  41  73  65   6  16  86  64
1   2  99  96  12  33  52  82  70
2  10  99  11  56  14  46  83  31
3   5  50  46  48  37  37  15  57
4   8  17  96  32  61  99  44  27
5  51  82  10  88  78  44  88  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring no envy among agents. We'll use an envy-free allocation method to assign these items.

Let's begin by examining the highest valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest with a value of 86.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest with a value of 99.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest with a value of 99.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest with a value of 57.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest with a value of 99.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the highest with a value of 88.

We will start by assigning these highest-valued items to each agent where possible. If an item is the highest for more than one agent, we'll need to prioritize based on overall fairness.

Let's make a preliminary allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Given item 1 is already taken, assign item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest value).
4. Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, leaving items 0 and 4 unallocated. 

Let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 (82) highly, so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Item 4 is left, and Agent 5 values item 4 relatively highly (78), so assign item 4 to Agent 5.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```

All items are allocated, and each agent receives items based on high individual valuations, aiming to minimize envy.
