Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  14  25  60   1  46  54  97
1   5  49  82  36  66  40  74  97
2  52  72  83  99  95  10  84  55
3  84  89  94  91  84  64  40  71
4  29   8  51  78  81  82  49  46
5  15  66  96  32  92  78  25  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, the aim is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness with discrete items, we'll aim for a fair division that attempts to minimize envy and distribute the items in a balanced manner.

Here's a step-by-step consideration for allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items:** Examine which items have distinctly high valuations from multiple agents, as these can be crucial in balancing the allocation.

2. **Preliminary Assignment:** Assign items to agents who value them highly, ensuring that no one agent receives all or most of the high-value items.

3. **Balance the Total Value:** Attempt to balance the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent, taking care to distribute items such that the perceived total value is as equitable as possible.

4. **Adjust for Envy:** Reassign items if an agentâ€™s allocation is significantly less valuable than others, aiming to adjust for any apparent envy.

Using these principles, here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 5 (values: 86, 46)
- **Agent 1:** Item 7 (value: 97)
- **Agent 2:** Items 3, 6 (values: 99, 84)
- **Agent 3:** Item 2 (value: 94)
- **Agent 4:** Items 4, 1 (values: 81, 8)
- **Agent 5:** Item 1 (value: 66)

Now, let's format this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 1],
    "5": []
}
```

Note: The allocations are balanced to achieve a fair division, but complete envy-freeness may not be possible with discrete items.
