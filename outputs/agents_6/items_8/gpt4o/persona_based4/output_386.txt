Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  85  15  71   9  79  29  78
1  58   9  43  75  34  40  61  47
2  44  10  79  90  30  56  74  75
3  21  68  98  59  42  10  35   4
4  23  81   7  93  67  84  34  47
5  26  68  65   0  73  95  96  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [26 68 65  0 73 95 96 81]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that envy is minimized or eliminated if possible. Given that each agent has a different valuation for each item, our goal is to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that no agent significantly envies another's allocation.

Here's a potential allocation based on the provided valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 1 highly (85) and item 5 (79).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 0 highly (58) and item 6 (61).
- **Agent 2:** Values item 3 highly (90) and item 2 (79).
- **Agent 3:** Values item 2 highly (98) and item 1 (68).
- **Agent 4:** Values item 3 highly (93) and item 5 (84).
- **Agent 5:** Values item 6 highly (96) and item 5 (95).

Given the constraints, let's allocate the items to maximize the total valuations while trying to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** gets item 1 (valued at 85) and item 5 (79).
2. **Agent 1** gets item 0 (58) and item 6 (61).
3. **Agent 2** gets item 3 (90).
4. **Agent 3** gets item 2 (98).
5. **Agent 4** gets item 4 (67).
6. **Agent 5** gets item 7 (81).

This allocation aims to give each agent their highest-valued items as much as possible, considering the constraints. Note that due to the small number of items relative to agents, some compromises must be made.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least some of their most valued items while keeping the total number of items distributed correctly.
