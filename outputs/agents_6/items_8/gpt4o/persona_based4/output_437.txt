Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  20  54  22  25  26   0  50
1  14  58  93  24  96  62  36  17
2  53  26  63  78  55  69  13   8
3  49  47  95  37  11  61  93   2
4  89  95   7  98  28  59  98  83
5  51  26  71  40   7  93  53  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can utilize a fair division method that aims to reduce envy and ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach is to use the Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) criterion, where no agent feels another agent has a strictly better allocation after potentially removing one item from the other agent's bundle.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [83, 20, 54, 22, 25, 26, 0, 50]
Agent 1: [14, 58, 93, 24, 96, 62, 36, 17]
Agent 2: [53, 26, 63, 78, 55, 69, 13, 8]
Agent 3: [49, 47, 95, 37, 11, 61, 93, 2]
Agent 4: [89, 95, 7, 98, 28, 59, 98, 83]
Agent 5: [51, 26, 71, 40, 7, 93, 53, 63]
```

The goal is to allocate these 8 items among 6 agents.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Highest Valuation First:** Assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Balance Number of Items:** Ensure each agent has a fair number of items, balancing the distribution.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Valued highest by Agent 4 (89)
- **Item 1:** Valued highest by Agent 4 (95)
- **Item 2:** Valued highest by Agent 3 (95)
- **Item 3:** Valued highest by Agent 4 (98)
- **Item 4:** Valued highest by Agent 1 (96)
- **Item 5:** Valued highest by Agent 5 (93)
- **Item 6:** Valued highest by Agent 4 (98)
- **Item 7:** Valued highest by Agent 4 (83)

### Balancing and Final Allocation:
- Agent 4 has been allocated too many items. Let's redistribute to ensure fair distribution:
  - Reassign Item 6 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation 93)
  - Reassign Item 1 to Agent 0 (second highest valuation 20)
  - Reassign Item 7 to Agent 5 (second highest valuation 63)

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [0, 3],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item (except Agent 2, due to limited items available per agent) and attempts to satisfy the criteria of fairness based on the given valuations.
