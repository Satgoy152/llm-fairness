Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  53  18  15  85  25  20  66
1  47  22  87  78  91  95  10  30
2  35   4  97  19  47  60  73   6
3  68  94  49   3  92  12  64  72
4  34  45  94  82  21  40  19  12
5  94  58  15   8  29  25  32  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a method like the Envy-Free Matching, but due to the discrete nature of this problem and the small number of agents and items, we'll manually work through a solution that attempts to balance each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 21 + 53 + 18 + 15 + 85 + 25 + 20 + 66 = 303
- Agent 1: 47 + 22 + 87 + 78 + 91 + 95 + 10 + 30 = 460
- Agent 2: 35 + 4 + 97 + 19 + 47 + 60 + 73 + 6 = 341
- Agent 3: 68 + 94 + 49 + 3 + 92 + 12 + 64 + 72 = 454
- Agent 4: 34 + 45 + 94 + 82 + 21 + 40 + 19 + 12 = 347
- Agent 5: 94 + 58 + 15 + 8 + 29 + 25 + 32 + 83 = 344

Next, we seek to distribute the items while considering each agent's preferences. We try to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation more than their own.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 7] (Values: 53, 66)
- Agent 1: [4] (Value: 91)
- Agent 2: [2] (Value: 97)
- Agent 3: [0, 5] (Values: 68, 12)
- Agent 4: [3, 6] (Values: 82, 19)
- Agent 5: [] (No items, but allocated to others)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed. Each agent gets valuable items according to their preferences, minimizing potential envy.

Therefore, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation gives a fair distribution of items and attempts to respect the agents' valuations given the constraints.
