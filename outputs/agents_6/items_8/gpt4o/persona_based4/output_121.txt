Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  99  33  90  31  47  41  71
1   4  64  94  91  72  24  63  93
2  16  46  24  80  59  49  55  52
3  79  20  79  87   3  54  78  36
4  88  20   9   3  79  26  58  63
5  89  64  88  23  17  51  74  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This can be complex, but one straightforward approach is to use a round-robin draft where agents take turns picking the most valued item left for them, ensuring that each agent has an equal opportunity to pick items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy for the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values the item 1 highest among all agents, so they pick item 1.
2. **Agent 5**: Values item 7 highest after agent 0 has picked, so they pick item 7.
3. **Agent 3**: Now picks item 0 which is the highest value available from their perspective.
4. **Agent 1**: Picks item 2 as it's their highest unpicked valued item.
5. **Agent 5**: Picks item 6 as it has the highest remaining value for them.
6. **Agent 3**: Picks item 3 as it's next highest from their perspective.
7. **Agent 4**: Picks item 4 as it's their next highest valued item.
8. **Agent 2**: Picks item 5 as it's their highest valued item remaining.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent has received items based on their highest available valuations, minimizing the possibility of envy. Note that some agents may still feel envy if their total valuation of their assigned items is less than the total valuation of another agent's assigned items, but this is a common challenge in discrete allocations with differing individual valuations.
