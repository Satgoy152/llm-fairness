Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  45   2  53  89  57  26  11
1  77   2  32  24  98  74  32  13
2  85  31  40  39  57  96  90  88
3  52  33  24  14  69  80  98  99
4  50  20  64   0  88  21  70  81
5  68  37   1  19  44  80  65  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent receives items they value highly. This method will help reduce the likelihood of envy among agents. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [25, 45, 2, 53, 89, 57, 26, 11]
   - Highest values are for items 4 and 5.
   - Allocate: [5, 4]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [77, 2, 32, 24, 98, 74, 32, 13]
   - Highest value is for item 4, which is already allocated.
   - Next highest are items 0 and 5.
   - Allocate: [0, 5]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [85, 31, 40, 39, 57, 96, 90, 88]
   - Highest values are for items 2, 6, and 7.
   - Allocate: [6, 2]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: [52, 33, 24, 14, 69, 80, 98, 99]
   - Highest values are for items 6 and 7, but item 6 is already allocated.
   - Allocate: [7]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Values: [50, 20, 64, 0, 88, 21, 70, 81]
   - Highest values are for items 4, 6, and 7, all of which have been allocated.
   - Next highest is item 2.
   - Allocate: []

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Values: [68, 37, 1, 19, 44, 80, 65, 76]
   - Highest values are for items 5, 6, and 7, but these are already allocated.
   - Next highest are items 0 and 1.
   - Allocate: [1, 3]

By allocating based on the highest remaining values and ensuring each agent gets items they value, we can minimize envy and ensure fairness. Here's the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
