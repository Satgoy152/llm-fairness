Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9   5  27  84  17  92  26  48
1  55  88  30  51  90  30  21  18
2  22   8   6  40  34  48   5  23
3  34  46  84  51  99  67  15  65
4  76  55  72  16  74   6  43  14
5  29  36  33  70  74  18  15  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we should aim to minimize envy among agents by considering their valuations for items. Here, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy or considering each agent's total valuation for a set of items. Let's proceed with an allocation approach, trying to balance the total value each agent gets from their allocated items.

Here is one approach to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuation for item 5.
2. Agent 1 has high valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 has relatively low valuations but values item 3 reasonably.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 2 and 4.
5. Agent 4 has good valuations for item 0.
6. Agent 5 can take the remaining items since they have moderate valuations across the board.

Considering these points, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [5] (92)
- Agent 1: [1] (88)
- Agent 2: [3] (40)
- Agent 3: [2, 4] (84 + 99 = 183)
- Agent 4: [0] (76)
- Agent 5: [6, 7] (15 + 11 = 26)

This allocation attempts to give each agent some items they value highly, minimizing overall envy. Let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6, 7]
}
```
