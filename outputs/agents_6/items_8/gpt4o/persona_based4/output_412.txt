Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35   9   7  29   8  15   1  25
1  34  51  43  13  77  99   1  36
2  15  25   0  72  74  32  31  19
3  60  39  74  70  48  26  27  57
4  73   9  42  90  28  57   0  16
5  44  90  14  35   3  52  45  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. A common method is to use a round-robin or priority approach based on valuations. Here, I'll attempt to find a fair allocation:

1. **Identify priorities**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to determine their priority. Agents with higher total valuations should get priority in the initial rounds of allocation.

   - Agent 0: \(35 + 9 + 7 + 29 + 8 + 15 + 1 + 25 = 129\)
   - Agent 1: \(34 + 51 + 43 + 13 + 77 + 99 + 1 + 36 = 354\)
   - Agent 2: \(15 + 25 + 0 + 72 + 74 + 32 + 31 + 19 = 268\)
   - Agent 3: \(60 + 39 + 74 + 70 + 48 + 26 + 27 + 57 = 401\)
   - Agent 4: \(73 + 9 + 42 + 90 + 28 + 57 + 0 + 16 = 315\)
   - Agent 5: \(44 + 90 + 14 + 35 + 3 + 52 + 45 + 97 = 380\)

   Based on these sums, the priority order from highest to lowest is: 3, 5, 1, 4, 2, 0.

2. **Allocate using priority**: Begin by allocating items to each agent based on their highest valuation that hasn't been taken yet, following the priority order.

   - **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is item 2 (74). Assign item 2.
   - **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is item 1 (90). Assign item 1.
   - **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is item 5 (99). Assign item 5.
   - **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is item 3 (90). Assign item 3.
   - **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is item 4 (74). Assign item 4.
   - **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is item 0 (35). Assign item 0.
   
   Now, re-evaluate remaining items for allocation (items 6 and 7):
   
   - **Agent 3**: Next highest is item 3 (70), but it's taken. Next highest available is item 7 (57). Assign item 7.
   - **Agent 5**: Next highest is item 7 (97), but it's taken. Next highest available is item 6 (45). Assign item 6.

3. **Resulting allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [5]
   - Agent 2: [4]
   - Agent 3: [2, 7]
   - Agent 4: [3]
   - Agent 5: [1, 6]

These allocations should be fair and envy-free given the constraints and methodology used.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
