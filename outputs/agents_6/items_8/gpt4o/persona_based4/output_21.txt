Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  25  62  77  82  39  43  67
1  55   1   7  18   5  95  11  23
2  47  40  61  93  13   6  85  26
3  34  65  53  29  96  68  45  46
4  84  96  66  74  15  15  37  37
5   0  44  23  72  65  38  49  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 40 61 93 13  6 85 26]
 [34 65 53 29 96 68 45 46]
 [84 96 66 74 15 15 37 37]
 [ 0 44 23 72 65 38 49 69]]
Output:
To allocate the 8 items among the 6 agents fairly, we will aim to achieve a division where no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation. This involves trying to maximize the minimum satisfaction level of each agent.

First, let's identify some potential high-value allocations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (82) and item 3 (77).
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly (95).
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly (93).
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (96).
- Agent 4 values items 1 (96) and 0 (84).
- Agent 5 values item 7 (69) and item 3 (72).

Now, let's construct an allocation that tries to respect these preferences while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and minimizing envy:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as it has the highest valuation (96) among all agents.
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation (95) for that agent.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 4, as it has the highest valuation (96) for that agent.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it has the highest valuation (93) for that agent.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 4, as it has a high valuation (84) for that agent.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it has a high valuation (62) for that agent.
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 5, as it has a high valuation (69) for that agent.
8. Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it has a decent valuation (43) for that agent.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and we try to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": [7]
}
```
