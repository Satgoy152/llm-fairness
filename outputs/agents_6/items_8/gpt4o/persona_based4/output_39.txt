Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  25  71  43  17  57  68  21
1  85  28  89  41  90  23  53  82
2  25  45  10  65  59  62  81  38
3  18  14  33  23  11  23  17  83
4  40  34  70  51  66   6  42  35
5  35  59  54  54  96  64  44  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a division that considers the valuations given by each agent for every item. A common goal in fair division is to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, one approach is to allocate one or two items to each agent in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while minimizing potential envy.

Let's consider a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 highly values item 2 (71) and item 6 (68), we can allocate these items to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 4 (90) and item 0 (85), so we allocate these items to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 (81) the most, but since it is already taken, we consider item 5 (62) and item 3 (65).
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 7 (83), so we allocate this item to them.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 4 (66) and item 2 (70) highly, but since these are taken, we consider item 0 (40) and item 3 (51).
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 4 (96) the most, however, since it is taken, we allocate item 1 (59) and item 5 (64).

Now, let's ensure each item is allocated and no item is allocated more than once:

- Item 0 is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 1 is allocated to Agent 5.
- Item 2 is allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 3 is allocated to Agent 2.
- Item 4 is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 5 is allocated to Agent 5.
- Item 6 is allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 7 is allocated to Agent 3.

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
