Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  21  79  85  51  60  19  46
1  86  75  40  56  88  62  60  78
2  48  61  27  28  64  24  87   5
3  24  26  53  99  26  52  25  24
4  35  48  31  35  19  28  48  49
5  76  29  57  86  60  90   4   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider each agent's preferences and attempt to distribute the items such that there is no envy among agents. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as anyone else's allocation, according to their own valuation.

To achieve this, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items combined.
2. Distribute items starting with the agent who has the highest valuation for a particular item, ensuring that once an item is allocated, it cannot be re-allocated.
3. Continue allocating items while trying to maintain balance so that no agent feels envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Calculation of Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 99 + 21 + 79 + 85 + 51 + 60 + 19 + 46 = 460
- Agent 1: 86 + 75 + 40 + 56 + 88 + 62 + 60 + 78 = 545
- Agent 2: 48 + 61 + 27 + 28 + 64 + 24 + 87 + 5 = 344
- Agent 3: 24 + 26 + 53 + 99 + 26 + 52 + 25 + 24 = 329
- Agent 4: 35 + 48 + 31 + 35 + 19 + 28 + 48 + 49 = 293
- Agent 5: 76 + 29 + 57 + 86 + 60 + 90 + 4 + 2 = 404

### Allocation of Items:
- Start with items that agents value highly.
- Allocate item by item considering the highest valuation first, then consider other items for remaining agents.

#### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it highest at 99.
2. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it highest at 99.
3. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it highest at 88.
4. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it highest at 90.
5. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it highest at 87.
6. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it second-highest at 79 (after item 0).
7. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it second-highest at 78 (after item 4).
8. **Item 1**: Agent 2 takes it as they value it second-highest at 61 (after item 6).

Now, we allocate the items accordingly:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation is designed to maximize fairness and minimize envy among the agents based on their preferences.
