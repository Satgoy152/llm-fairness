Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  66  32  27  43  77  33  97
1  88  26  43  27  56  43  83  94
2  81  91  98  81  69  41   5  22
3   6  48  26  73  73   1  55  33
4  35  22  28  51  83  11  61  21
5  77  93  95  88  28  63  13  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to evaluate each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness and satisfaction for each agent based on their preferences. 

Let's begin by considering a simple allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 7 (97), so we allocate item 7 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest remaining value for item 6 (83), so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (98), so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high value for item 3 (73), so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 (83) the most, so we allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 1 (93), so we allocate item 1 to agent 5.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 5:

7. **Agent 0** values item 0 (95) the most among remaining options, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
8. **Agent 5** values item 5 (63) the most among remaining options, so we allocate item 5 to agent 5.

Considering the above allocations, here's the final distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their preference as closely as possible, given the constraint of integer allocations and the number of items.
