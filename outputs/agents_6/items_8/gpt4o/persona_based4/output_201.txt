Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  31  57  80   0  97  26  43
1  29  62  45  55  24  65  18  68
2  92  59  51  84   7  43  15   2
3  61  79  35  70  65  41  80   8
4  25  77  46  52  81  65  65   3
5   9   5  16  63  97  50   8  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we can use a mechanism such as the round-robin method. This method involves allowing each agent to pick their most valued item iteratively until all items have been allocated. Given the valuations, we will perform the allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Agent 0** picks item 5 (value = 97).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 7 (value = 68).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 0 (value = 92).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 6 (value = 80).
5. **Agent 4** picks item 4 (value = 81).
6. **Agent 5** picks item 3 (value = 63).
7. **Agent 0** picks item 3 (value = 80) but it's already taken, so they pick item 4 (value = 0), which is also taken, then pick item 0 (value = 65).
8. **Agent 1** picks item 1 (value = 62).

### Resulting Allocation

Now that all items are allocated, let's format the results into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, while taking turns to choose items.
