Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  60  57  12  18  51   3  14
1  80   3  34  54  72  46   2   5
2  22  16  88   5  42  97  37  89
3  27  66  85   5  76  58  74  66
4  36  78   1  49  72  93  64  17
5  60  27  12  36  11  29  26  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation based on the valuations of the agents for each item, we aim to distribute the items such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their own valuations.

Given the table, we can use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" process to allocate items. Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent, minimizing envy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents to understand its relative desirability.
2. Sequentially allocate items to agents based on their highest personal valuation that hasn't yet been assigned.

Let's assign the items:

1. Agent 0: Valuations are [71, 60, 57, 12, 18, 51, 3, 14]
   - Highest value item is 0 (value 71).

2. Agent 1: Valuations are [80, 3, 34, 54, 72, 46, 2, 5]
   - Highest value item is 0. Already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 4 (value 72).

3. Agent 2: Valuations are [22, 16, 88, 5, 42, 97, 37, 89]
   - Highest value item is 5 (value 97).

4. Agent 3: Valuations are [27, 66, 85, 5, 76, 58, 74, 66]
   - Highest value item is 2 (value 85).

5. Agent 4: Valuations are [36, 78, 1, 49, 72, 93, 64, 17]
   - Highest value item is 5. Already taken by Agent 2. Next highest is item 1 (value 78).

6. Agent 5: Valuations are [60, 27, 12, 36, 11, 29, 26, 79]
   - Highest value item is 7 (value 79).

Now we have allocated 6 out of 8 items. We continue:

- Remaining items [3, 6] are unallocated. We allocate them to the agents with the next highest valuation among the remaining items.

7. Agent 2: Next highest for item 6 (value 37).

8. Agent 3: Next highest for item 3 (value 5).

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [5, 6]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [7]

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7]
}
```
