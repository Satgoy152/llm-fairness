Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  96  43  88  83  68  65   9
1  11  16  21  67  30  23  92  95
2  64  82  55  44   2  97   9  93
3   8  83  55  94  67  12  30  75
4  15  34  23  55  13  70  21  53
5  26  93  81   8  93  10  45  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent perceives their own allocation as at least as good as the allocation of any other agent based on their valuations.

Given that we have 8 items and 6 agents, each agent can receive either 1 or 2 items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 7 and 6 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 5 and 7 highly, but item 7 is already allocated, so we choose item 5 and another high-value item for them, such as item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the highest.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has relatively low valuations across the board, but we can give them item 4, which they value reasonably highly.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 2 highly.

Let's allocate the items as follows to ensure all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 7
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 3
- **Agent 4**: Item 4
- **Agent 5**: Items 2, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that respects their valuations as much as possible, given the constraint of a total of 8 items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```
