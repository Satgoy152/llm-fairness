Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  10  74   1  11  49  32  59
1  61  33  80   5  96  95  41  84
2  32  45  30  85  93  20  17  23
3   6  29  19  32  77  56  44  39
4  52  28  72  33  18  28  25  88
5  24  24  87  11  52  11  20  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, I'll use an approach that tries to ensure envy-freeness, meaning each agent should feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the constraints, I will aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocated items as highly as possible.

To achieve this, I will:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to determine their preferences.
2. Use a round-robin allocation method where in each round, the next agent (in a specified sequence) gets to choose their most preferred remaining item.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate each agent's total value for all items:
   - Agent 0: 259
   - Agent 1: 495
   - Agent 2: 345
   - Agent 3: 302
   - Agent 4: 344
   - Agent 5: 288

2. Sequence the agents based on their total values. A lower total value indicates a higher priority.
   - Priority order: 0, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1

3. Allocate items in a round-robin fashion based on the priority order:
   - Agent 0 gets their highest valued item first, then Agent 5, and so on.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Round 1:
  - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 74)
  - Agent 5 picks item 2 (value 87) but already taken, picks item 7 (value 59)
  - Agent 3 picks item 4 (value 77)
  - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 93) but already taken, picks item 3 (value 85)
  - Agent 4 picks item 7 (value 88) but already taken, picks item 2 (value 72) but already taken, picks item 7 (value 88)
  - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 96) but already taken, picks item 5 (value 95)

- Continue until all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6, 1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, keeping in mind each agent's preferences as closely as possible.
