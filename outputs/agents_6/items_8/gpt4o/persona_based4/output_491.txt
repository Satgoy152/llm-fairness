Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  71  46  70  23  33  42  44
1  81  93  71  98  12  84  92  21
2  52  36  18   1   8  69  23  82
3  79  59  49  19   4  79   5  45
4  86  28  65  82  70  37   9  60
5   7  34  95  10  94  46  65  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent receives items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another over their own. Given that the number of items equals the number of agents, we'll distribute one item per agent initially and then allocate the remaining items while ensuring fairness and minimizing envy.

### Step-by-step Allocation Strategy:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Each agent receives one item that they value highly.

2. **Subsequent Allocation:**
   - Allocate the remaining items in a manner that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction while maintaining fairness.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 0 (value of 80, highest for Agent 0)
  - Item 4 (value of 23)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 3 (value of 98, highest for Agent 1)

- **Agent 2**: 
  - Item 7 (value of 82, highest for Agent 2)

- **Agent 3**: 
  - Item 5 (value of 79, highest for Agent 3)

- **Agent 4**: 
  - Item 6 (value of 9, but it is the least valued item remaining for Agent 4)

- **Agent 5**: 
  - Item 2 (value of 95, highest for Agent 5)
  - Item 1 (value of 34)

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one of their higher-valued items, balancing the remaining items as fairly as possible. 

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 1]
}
```

This setup ensures that each agent receives items in a way that attempts to minimize envy and distributes all 8 items fairly among the 6 agents.
