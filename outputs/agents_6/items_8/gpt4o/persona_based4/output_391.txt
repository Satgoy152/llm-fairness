Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  74   1  63  78  80   9  75
1  74  91  99  56  73  57  46  87
2  48  68  94  29   4  78  90  56
3  75  86  18  28  57   5  62  70
4  50  41  19  84  18  97   2  50
5  21  20  29  59   4  29   5  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and maximize overall satisfaction based on the agents' valuations. With 6 agents and 8 items, not all agents will receive an item, but we will try to allocate items in a way that considers each agent's preferences.

Here's a strategy to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate the highest-valued items to agents who value them most, ensuring that each item is unique to a single agent.
3. Continue the allocation process while balancing the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

After analyzing the valuations, the following allocation can be considered:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (value 80).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (value 99).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (value 90).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (value 86).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (value 84).
- Agent 5 values item 7 the highest (value 44).

Let's now allocate the remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item, while maximizing their valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 7.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 3.
- Agent 5 gets item 4.

The allocations based on the above considerations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent as much as possible.
