Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  53  93  74  57  56  63  51
1  82  22  41  15   8  91  43  81
2  88  28  51  78  37   7  52  88
3  89  67   1   0  86   1  22  98
4  28  57  57  40  19  85  58  71
5   2  52  75  49  13  75  56  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can employ a heuristic approach such as maximizing the total value each agent receives, given that a fully envy-free allocation may not be entirely achievable due to the discrete nature of items and varying valuations. However, we will aim to minimize envy as much as possible.

Let's start by considering each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate them accordingly while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations - [64, 53, 93, 74, 57, 56, 63, 51]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (93)

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations - [82, 22, 41, 15, 8, 91, 43, 81]
   - Highest value: Item 5 (91)

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations - [88, 28, 51, 78, 37, 7, 52, 88]
   - Highest values: Item 0 (88) and Item 7 (88)

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations - [89, 67, 1, 0, 86, 1, 22, 98]
   - Highest value: Item 7 (98)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (89)

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations - [28, 57, 57, 40, 19, 85, 58, 71]
   - Highest value: Item 5 (85)

6. **Agent 5**: Valuations - [2, 52, 75, 49, 13, 75, 56, 93]
   - Highest value: Item 7 (93)

We will proceed with the allocation, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and trying to match their highest preferences:

- Give Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Give Item 5 to Agent 1.
- Give Item 0 to Agent 2 (highest tie broken arbitrarily).
- Give Item 7 to Agent 3 (highest value).
- Give Item 1 to Agent 4 (next highest value after 5 was taken).
- Give Item 3 to Agent 5.

Remaining items: Item 4 and Item 6. Distribute these to minimize envy:

- Give Item 4 to Agent 4 (as it holds a decent value for this agent).
- Give Item 6 to Agent 0 (as this complements Agent 0's allocations well).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and we've tried to minimize envy given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
