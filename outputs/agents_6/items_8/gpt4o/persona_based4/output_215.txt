Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17   9   6   7  78  85  98  48
1  16  93  36  56   3   8  72   4
2  62  96  68  60  15  38  26  66
3  63  31  60  78  53  70  49  97
4  71  98  36  12  30  33   9  28
5  47  11  70  83  69  65  96  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that ensures envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the "adjusted winner procedure" or some heuristic approach that balances the agents' valuations and ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the total value. Given the complexity of the problem and the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we'll use a heuristic approach to balance the allocation.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 348
- Agent 1: 288
- Agent 2: 431
- Agent 3: 501
- Agent 4: 317
- Agent 5: 528

Next, we will attempt to allocate items in a way that approximates equal value distribution across agents. This involves prioritizing higher value items for agents that value them significantly more than others, and ensuring each agent gets at least one item (since there are 8 items and only 6 agents, some will get more than one).

Here's a possible allocation based on the above approach:

1. Agent 0 gets item 6 (high value for Agent 0).
2. Agent 1 gets item 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Agent 2 gets item 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. Agent 3 gets item 7 (highest value for Agent 3).
5. Agent 4 gets item 4 (relatively higher value for Agent 4).
6. Agent 5 gets item 5 (highest value for Agent 5).
7. Agent 5 also gets item 3 (relatively high value for Agent 5).
8. Agent 3 also gets item 0 (relatively high value for Agent 3).

This allocation tries to balance the value received by each agent based on their valuations. Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and tries to provide a fair division based on the agents' valuations.
