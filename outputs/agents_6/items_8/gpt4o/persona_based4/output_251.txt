Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  64  92  31   3  95   4  41
1  28  86  62  37  21  46  76  16
2  63  27  91  51  51  52  23  66
3  71  22  31  74  85  84  49  34
4  22  97  53  61  54  44   3   7
5  65  51  69  43  36  62  59  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to find an allocation where no agent envies another agentâ€™s allocation. One approach to achieve this is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a similar fair division algorithm, but since this is a computational task, I'll use a heuristic approach to find a reasonable allocation. 

Given the table, we need to:

1. Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, to maximize fairness.
2. Attempt to balance the total value of items each agent receives based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 2 and 5 highly (92 and 95).
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (86).
- Agent 2 values items 0 and 2 highly (63 and 91).
- Agent 3 values items 3 and 4 highly (74 and 85).
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (97).
- Agent 5 values items 0 and 7 highly (65 and 68).

A possible fair division could be:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (highest value for them).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (highest value for them).
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (second-highest value for them but highest available).
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (highest value for them).
- Agent 4 gets item 3 (third-highest value, but due to constraints, this balances better).
- Agent 5 gets items 0, 6, and 7 (this set balances their total value).

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preference order. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
