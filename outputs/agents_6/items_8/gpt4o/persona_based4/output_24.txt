Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  90   6  66  23  26  87  87
1  89  32  97  55  72  99  84  68
2  86  92  38  22  74  69  52  54
3  39  63  74  14  96  48  38  45
4  62  56  26  24  41  39  67  66
5  22  86  68  72  30  23  31  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible within the constraints of integer allocations. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in all scenarios, we will aim for an allocation that is as balanced as possible based on the given valuations.

First, let's consider the sum of valuations for each agent to understand which agents have the highest overall valuation preferences:

- Agent 0: 43 + 90 + 6 + 66 + 23 + 26 + 87 + 87 = 428
- Agent 1: 89 + 32 + 97 + 55 + 72 + 99 + 84 + 68 = 596
- Agent 2: 86 + 92 + 38 + 22 + 74 + 69 + 52 + 54 = 487
- Agent 3: 39 + 63 + 74 + 14 + 96 + 48 + 38 + 45 = 417
- Agent 4: 62 + 56 + 26 + 24 + 41 + 39 + 67 + 66 = 381
- Agent 5: 22 + 86 + 68 + 72 + 30 + 23 + 31 + 92 = 424

To allocate items, let's take a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item until all items are assigned. We'll then adjust to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

1. Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (89)
2. Item 1: Highest value by Agent 2 (92)
3. Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (97)
4. Item 3: Highest value by Agent 5 (72)
5. Item 4: Highest value by Agent 3 (96)
6. Item 5: Highest value by Agent 1 (99)
7. Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (87)
8. Item 7: Highest value by Agent 5 (92)

Now let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Items 3, 7

This allocation meets the condition of distributing all 8 items while considering the highest preferences and attempting to balance the allocation.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 7]
}
```
