Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  97  96  37  31  15  11  91
1  36  49  64  30  53  37  11  51
2  99  96  85  18   9  14  81  81
3  49  91  49  73  34   3  54  33
4  79  86  76  79  57  54  95  99
5  88  75  96  66  91  97  46  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free division where each agent values their assigned bundle of items at least as highly as any other agent's bundle. Given the constraints and the need for a fair allocation, we can use a systematic approach to achieve this.

One approach is to use an algorithmic method like the “round-robin” or “maximum marginal return” method, which aims to distribute items based on agents’ preferences. Considering the complexity and potential for multiple solutions, we'll work through the allocations step by step, aiming for fairness.

First, let's consider the total value each agent places on all items and try to achieve a somewhat balanced distribution of value:

- Agent 0: Total value = 395
- Agent 1: Total value = 331
- Agent 2: Total value = 483
- Agent 3: Total value = 386
- Agent 4: Total value = 625
- Agent 5: Total value = 576

Now, let's proceed with allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Try to balance the value across agents.

Following this method:

- Item 0 (valued highest by Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2
- Item 1 (valued highest by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0
- Item 2 (valued highest by Agent 5): Assign to Agent 5
- Item 3 (valued highest by Agent 3): Assign to Agent 3
- Item 4 (valued highest by Agent 5): Assign to Agent 5
- Item 5 (valued highest by Agent 5): Assign to Agent 5
- Item 6 (valued highest by Agent 4): Assign to Agent 4
- Item 7 (valued highest by Agent 4): Assign to Agent 4

Now, we ensure each agent has at least one item and balance the value distribution:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [6, 7]
- Agent 5: [2, 4, 5]

We also need to ensure all items are allocated, so we should re-evaluate and distribute any unassigned items to achieve at least one item per agent:

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6, 7],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, the total number of items distributed is 8, and the allocation attempts to respect agents' preferences.
