Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  15  39   9  52   6  71  33
1  17  38  22  52  58  45  59  53
2   5  61  63  43  16  55  78  22
3  63  48   8  78  88  37  57  30
4  30  87   1  71  33  91  63  84
5  67  30  71  13  15   8  68  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 38 22 52 58 45 59 53]
 [ 5 61 63 43 16 55 78 22]

 [30 87  1 71 33 91 63 84]
 [67 30 71 13 15  8 68 33]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes individual satisfaction while maintaining overall fairness. Given the table of valuations, we should ensure that the allocation minimizes envy among agents. One method to achieve this is the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which seeks to maximize the product of utilities.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 6 the most, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 4 the most, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 6 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest valued item is item 2, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 4 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest valued item is item 3, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 5 the most, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5:** Values item 2 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest valued item is item 0, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 5.
7. **Further Allocation:** Now we have items 1 and 7 left. We look for agents who would benefit from these items:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 7, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 among the remaining unallocated, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives a number of items that reflects a fair division based on their preferences, minimizing envy, and ensuring that each item is allocated.
