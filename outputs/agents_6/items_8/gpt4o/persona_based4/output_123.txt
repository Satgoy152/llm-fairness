Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  24  36   2  91  29  75  16
1  49  31  19   6  15  82  60  39
2  48  11  19  55  75  88  63  30
3  79  91  16  43  76  52  33  91
4   7  38  24  31  72  94  39  19
5  99  19  63  79   4  89  77   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-freeness for the allocation of the 8 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute the items so that the perceived value is as balanced as possible across agents. 

One approach to reach a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's minimum value from the items they receive, which is a simplified version of the maximin share guarantee. Given the valuations matrix, we can attempt to allocate the items to achieve a balanced allocation.

Hereâ€™s one possible way to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Receives item 4 with a high valuation of 91.
- **Agent 1**: Receives items 5 and 7, with valuations of 82 and 39 respectively.
- **Agent 2**: Receives item 6, with a valuation of 63.
- **Agent 3**: Receives items 1 and 3, with valuations of 91 and 43 respectively.
- **Agent 4**: Receives item 2, with a valuation of 24.
- **Agent 5**: Receives item 0, with the highest valuation of 99.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the total perceived value among the agents as fairly as possible given the constraints. Each agent receives at least one item, and no items are left unallocated.
