Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  96  50  12  95  95  53  31
1   2  16  27  10  40  83   8  77
2  97  14  44   5  51  55   5  52
3  65  88  44  58  89  76  76  99
4  76  20  66  77  12  74  11  93
5  87  18  99  34  51  62  81   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures a balanced distribution of values. Given this setup, we'll try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction while considering the overall fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items 0, 1, 4, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation only on item 5. Item 7 is also relatively high.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 highly, and next item 5.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 the highest, followed by items 4 and 1.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation on item 7 and item 3.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 highly, followed by item 0.

Considering these preferences, we can attempt to allocate the items in a way that balances these values:

- **Agent 0** gets items [0, 1]: These are two of the highest-valued items for agent 0.
- **Agent 1** gets item [5]: This item is highly valued and unique for agent 1.
- **Agent 2** gets item [6]: This is not the highest-valued item, but it fits into a balanced allocation.
- **Agent 3** gets item [4]: A high-value item that is not as highly valued by other agents.
- **Agent 4** gets item [7]: The highest-valued item for agent 4.
- **Agent 5** gets items [2, 3]: Item 2 is highly valued by agent 5, and item 3 balances the allocation.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```
