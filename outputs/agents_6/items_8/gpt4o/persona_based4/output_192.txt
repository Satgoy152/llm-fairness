Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  57  45  89  88  44  44  75
1  70   7  22  64  17  35  45  31
2  78  10  45  70  58  98   9  29
3  42  27  69  94  78   8  16  75
4  24  79  66  55  48  50  30   9
5  54  66  55  37  83  34  74  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes the fairness criteria such as minimizing envy among the agents. Given the valuations matrix, one approach is to use a fair division algorithm like the envy-free allocation method. However, a simpler heuristic approach can be applied due to the limited number of agents and items.

Let's start by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuation for an item, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and each item is assigned to only one agent.

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 89.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 70.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 98.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken, so we choose the next highest, item 4, at 78.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the highest at 79.
6. Agent 5 values item 7 the highest at 89.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to minimize envy:

- Item 2: Assign to Agent 3, who values it at 69.
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 5, who values it at 74.

Here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a preferred item while distributing the remaining items to balance overall valuations and minimize envy.
