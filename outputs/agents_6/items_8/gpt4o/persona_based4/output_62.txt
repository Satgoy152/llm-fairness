Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  20  67   6   6  31  77  40
1  43  32  81  92  80  13   7  54
2  86  75  59  88  62   5  46  73
3  44  62  38  77  78  87  71  62
4  96  43  35  43  83  16  71  43
5  66  27  92  61  33  36  53  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. The goal is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given that each agent receives at least one item, resulting in a total of 8 items being allocated.

One approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin allocation process, which helps in distributing items fairly based on agents' preferences. However, since we need to customize this approach to ensure each agent gets at least one item while maintaining fairness, we can iterate over the agents and assign items based on their highest valuations that haven't been allocated yet.

Let's proceed with this process:

1. Start with each agent picking their most valued item.
2. Continue the process ensuring no agent is left without an item.
3. Assign remaining items based on remaining highest valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 84).
2. Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 92).
3. Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 86), but it's taken, so next best is item 3, which is taken. Then item 1 (value 75).
4. Agent 3 picks item 5 (value 87).
5. Agent 4 picks item 0 (value 96), but it's taken. Next best is item 4 (value 83).
6. Agent 5 picks item 2 (value 92).

After the first round, we have the following allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 2

Three items remain unallocated: 6, 7, and 8.

We continue with the second round:

1. Agent 0 can pick item 6 (value 77).
2. Agent 2 can pick item 7 (value 73).
3. Agent 3 can pick item 7, but it's taken, so next available item is 6, which is taken. Agent 3 is left with an empty choice, so no allocation in this round.
4. Agent 5 can pick item 7, but it's taken. No allocation in this round.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
