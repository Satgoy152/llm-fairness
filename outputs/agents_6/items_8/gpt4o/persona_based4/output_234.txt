Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  67   4  17  69  89  85  20
1  45  45   0   4  77  78  15  25
2  14   2  95  23  59  53  72  71
3  34  40  30  99  64  60  71  17
4  91  37  40  76  60  19  19  41
5  42  50  26  31  50   6  24  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner that minimizes envy among agents, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes each agent's perceived value or utility from their allotted items. Given that each agent should receive at least one item (since there are 8 items and 6 agents, some will receive more than one), we can use the following approach:

1. Assess each agent's highest valuation(s) and attempt to allocate items ensuring each agent gets at least one of their most valued items.
2. Try to balance the total value each agent receives by reallocating less contested items.
3. Ensure every item is allocated exactly once.

Here's an approach to achieve this allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 5 (value 89).
- Agent 1: Allocate item 4 (value 77).
- Agent 2: Allocate item 2 (value 95).
- Agent 3: Allocate item 3 (value 99).
- Agent 4: Allocate item 0 (value 91).
- Agent 5: Allocate item 7 (value 68).
- Now we have 2 items (1, 6) left. Allocate these to the agents who can gain the most value:
  - Agent 0: Allocate item 6 (value 85).
  - Agent 1: Allocate item 1 (value 45).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value and tries to minimize envy by distributing high-value items to different agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7]
}
```
