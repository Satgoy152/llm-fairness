Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55   7  14  44  60  91  75  43
1  94  31  74  43  45  68  67  96
2  89  20  11  51  11  29  97  26
3  75  61  50  27  95  33  45  36
4  58  63  91  93  57  12  80   5
5  97  63  44   1  94   6   4  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. Given that we have 6 agents and 8 items, we must ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. While perfect envy-freeness may not be possible with this constraint, we aim to minimize envy.

A common approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" based on the agents' highest valuations. We'll proceed by assigning items based on each agent's highest available valuations, iterating through the agents to minimize envy.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 5 values item 0 the highest (97) compared to others, so allocate item 0 to agent 5.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (31) compared to others, so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (91) compared to others, so allocate item 2 to agent 4.
4. Agent 4 also values item 3 the highest (93) compared to others, so allocate item 3 to agent 4.
5. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (95) compared to others, so allocate item 4 to agent 3.
6. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (91) compared to others, so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
7. Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (97) compared to others, so allocate item 6 to agent 2.
8. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (96) compared to others, so allocate item 7 to agent 1.

Let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items fairly, based on the agents' preferences, while maintaining integer allocations.
