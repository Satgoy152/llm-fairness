Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  41  60  29  61  52  15  76
1  31   5   2  75  65  23  54   6
2  42  59   5  70  54  71  61  99
3  28  12  46  11  78  15  72  31
4  32  98  64  44  99  75  76  72
5  18   2   2  17  29  44  62   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division, where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. Given the complexity of ensuring envy-freeness, we often have to rely on heuristics or compromise to get close to such a solution. Here, I'll attempt to provide a balanced allocation based on the provided valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible, while taking into account their preferences.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Items that have significantly higher valuations by certain agents should preferably be allocated to those agents to minimize envy.

2. **Balance Item Numbers:** Make sure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while ensuring the total number of allocated items is eight.

3. **Iterative Allocation:** Allocate items iteratively, starting with those that are most valuable to the agents, and adjusting to ensure all items are allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

- **Agent 0:** Highly values item 7 (76) and item 4 (61).
- **Agent 1:** Highly values item 3 (75) and item 4 (65).
- **Agent 2:** Highly values item 7 (99) and item 5 (71).
- **Agent 3:** Highly values item 4 (78) and item 6 (72).
- **Agent 4:** Highly values item 4 (99) and item 1 (98).
- **Agent 5:** Does not have high valuations, so we allocate based on remaining items.

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0:** Item 0 (58), Item 1 (41)
- **Agent 1:** Item 3 (75)
- **Agent 2:** Item 5 (71), Item 7 (99)
- **Agent 3:** Item 6 (72)
- **Agent 4:** Item 4 (99)
- **Agent 5:** Item 2 (2)

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by allocating the most valued items to the agents that value them highly while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Now, let's format the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
