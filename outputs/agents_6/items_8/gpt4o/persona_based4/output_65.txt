Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  29  63   7  94   0  68  57
1  95  51  88  37  23  14  58  22
2  80  12  79  56  39  41  95  24
3  37  27  76  68  57   7  89  56
4  29  84  91  85  39  17  69  12
5  89  31  80  78  79  46  25   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy among agents, we can employ an algorithm that attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction of any agent, often referred to as the maximin share (MMS) approach. Here, each agent should receive items such that their total valuation is as close as possible to their fair share, ideally without any agent envying another.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total sum of the valuations for each agent and determine a fair share. In this case, there are 8 items and 6 agents, so each agent should ideally get items totaling approximately 1/6 of the total valuation of all items if they were distributed evenly.

2. Allocate the items to agents while trying to maximize their individual satisfaction based on their valuations.

The individual item allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a subset of items based on their preferences while attempting to maintain a balance and minimize envy. Each agent receives either one or two items, and all items are allocated.
