Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  47  34  63  12  50  62  39
1   0  97  26   3   9  78  10  95
2  82  79  73   2  54  50  24   7
3  25  59   0  82  71  50  88  35
4   6  97  14  95  34   3  22  92
5  26  47  58  54   6  85  37  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and strives for an equitable distribution. A common approach to achieve this is using the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

To start, let's evaluate the maximum value each agent can achieve if they were to choose the items optimally for themselves. Then, we will try to allocate the items in such a way that each agent's total valuation is as close to their optimal as possible, while ensuring no agent envies another.

Below is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Calculate the sum of the highest possible valuations for each agent:**
    - Agent 0: 71, 63, 62 (total = 196)
    - Agent 1: 97, 95, 78 (total = 270)
    - Agent 2: 82, 79, 73 (total = 234)
    - Agent 3: 88, 82, 71 (total = 241)
    - Agent 4: 97, 95, 92 (total = 284)
    - Agent 5: 98, 85, 58 (total = 241)

2. **Allocate items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:**

    - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 82)
    - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4 (value = 97)
    - Allocate item 2 to Agent 5 (value = 58)
    - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4 (value = 95)
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (value = 71)
    - Allocate item 5 to Agent 5 (value = 85)
    - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value = 62)
    - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (value = 95)

3. **Check for any possible improvements and adjust to ensure the allocation is envy-free or as envy-free as possible.**

After completing the allocation process, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is made to maximize the total value each agent receives, aiming for envy-freeness.
