Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61   2  58  96  38   5  23  36
1  83  19  53  85  43  21  93  62
2  35  21  72  99   4  27  80  80
3  32  27  94  11  13  88  23  36
4  63  47  33  61  27  67  80  31
5  52  96  73   1  25  41  58  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences. We'll consider each agent's valuation and try to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Below is one possible allocation that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items [0, 2]
   - Total value: 61 + 58 = 119

2. **Agent 1**: Receives items [6, 7]
   - Total value: 93 + 62 = 155

3. **Agent 2**: Receives items [3]
   - Total value: 99

4. **Agent 3**: Receives items [5]
   - Total value: 88

5. **Agent 4**: Receives items [4]
   - Total value: 27

6. **Agent 5**: Receives items [1]
   - Total value: 96

This allocation is constructed to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. The allocation attempts to be fair by providing each agent with items they value highly, thereby minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
