Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  71  44  88  96  16  21  13
1  87  64  32  86  81  51  74  81
2  23   8  81  63  79  69  43  71
3   3  77  57  91  52  50  59  32
4  25  52  45  90  53  23  10  79
5  82  77  54  75  83  93   8  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to make sure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as any other allocation based on their valuation.

Given the valuations matrix, one way to achieve a fair allocation is to use an algorithm that balances the total perceived value across agents, such as the round-robin algorithm or the adjusted winner procedure. However, due to the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations and no item splitting, a balanced approach that minimizes envy as much as possible will be used here.

Let's proceed with a heuristic allocation based on maximizing each agent's total value while trying to minimize envy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Sort agents based on their total valuations.
3. Assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 76+71+44+88+96+16+21+13 = 425
   - Agent 1: 87+64+32+86+81+51+74+81 = 556
   - Agent 2: 23+8+81+63+79+69+43+71 = 437
   - Agent 3: 3+77+57+91+52+50+59+32 = 421
   - Agent 4: 25+52+45+90+53+23+10+79 = 377
   - Agent 5: 82+77+54+75+83+93+8+54 = 526

2. **Assign Items:**

   - Assign items to agents based on maximum individual valuations while ensuring at least one item per agent:

     - Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 87) and item 7 (value 81)
     - Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 93)
     - Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 96)
     - Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 91)
     - Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 81)
     - Agent 4 gets item 6 (value 10), since it's left with lowest value for others.

This allocation aims at balancing perceived values while ensuring each agent receives items they value. Note that perfect envy-freeness may not be achieved due to discrete item assignments.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item while attempting to minimize envy based on their respective valuations.
