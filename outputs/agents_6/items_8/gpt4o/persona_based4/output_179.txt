Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  89   5  21  42   5  97  37
1  78  94  55  93  98  56  25  41
2  85  80  93  37  89  64  92  68
3  78  20  82   0  86  52  90   3
4  79  82  48   7  60   6  75  62
5  97  66  21  98  13  86  69  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the 8 items to the 6 agents in a manner that attempts to be fair, given the individual valuations. While achieving perfect envy-freeness is challenging due to the discrete nature of items and differing preferences, we can aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible.

**Key considerations for allocation:**
1. **Maximize total utility:** Aim to allocate items such that the total valuation across all agents is maximized.
2. **Minimize envy:** Try to allocate items in a way that minimizes the difference between the total value each agent receives.
3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible:** Since there are more agents than items, at least two agents will not receive any items.

**Process:**
- Start by considering each agent's highest-valued items and allocate them if it doesn't significantly disadvantage others.
- Ensure that no item is allocated to more than one agent.
- Try to balance the total value each agent receives, keeping in mind the constraint of 8 items and 6 agents.

**Allocation:**
After careful consideration of the above points, one possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: [6] (Value: 97)
- Agent 1: [4] (Value: 98)
- Agent 2: [2] (Value: 93)
- Agent 3: [5] (Value: 52)
- Agent 4: [1, 7] (Value: 82 + 62 = 144)
- Agent 5: [0, 3] (Value: 97 + 98 = 195)

Each agent receives either one or two items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

**Resulting JSON format allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```
This allocation attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations, within the constraints provided.
