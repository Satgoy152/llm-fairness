Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  90  75  12  38  44  23  16
1  60  77   8  44  42   3  22  34
2  78  31  32  91  29  65  41  64
3  68  52   9  13  49  94  11  27
4  83  92  17   0   6   1  11  45
5  46  30  21  27  49  39  51  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while trying to ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's preferences and try to balance the overall valuation each agent receives. Given the valuations provided, I will perform an allocation that tries to equalize the total value received by each agent to the extent possible, taking into account the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the highest (90), followed by items 0 and 2 (both 75). To maximize agent 0's total value, let's allocate them items 0 and 1.

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest (77), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 0 (60), but it's also taken. Let's consider item 3 (44) and item 7 (34) for this agent.

3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (91), which is unallocated. Allocate item 3 to agent 2. Item 7 (64) is the next preferred choice for agent 2, but it's already allocated, so let's consider item 5 (65).

4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 5 (94), which is unallocated. Allocate item 5 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 1 (92), but it's allocated. Next, item 0 (83) is allocated. Allocate item 7 (45) to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Highly values item 7 (65), but it's allocated. Let's allocate item 6 (51) to agent 5.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 3: Items []
- Agent 4: Items [4]
- Agent 5: Items [6]

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on preferences, while ensuring each agent receives an item or their highest possible valued items. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
