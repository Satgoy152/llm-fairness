Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  53  86  35  43  31  16  69
1  35  14  32  67  34  42  79   8
2  82  98  56  42  37  14  77  52
3  62   2  11  43  75  47   1  13
4  93  63  89  22  70  88  39  48
5  79  76  22  45  40  31  91  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will try to give each agent items such that their perceived value of their allocated items is as equal as possible. Given that there are 8 items and 6 agents, some agents will get more items than others, but we will aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuation.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for items: 2 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for items: 6 (79).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for items: 1 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for items: 4 (75).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for items: 0 (93).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation for items: 6 (91). But since item 6 is already taken, we can give them their next highest, item 7 (71).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items in a way that ensures each agent still gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's allocate based on remaining high-value preferences and balancing the total number of items:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 2 (86)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 6 (79)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (98)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4 (75)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 0 (93), and Item 5 (88)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 7 (71), and Item 3 (45)

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 5],
    "5": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and two agents get two items due to the larger number of items compared to agents.
