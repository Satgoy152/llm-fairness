Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  39  14  68  29  96  31  47
1   2   7  79  98  19  78  39  74
2  70   3  45   8  53  40   9   2
3  81  21   5  70  62  91  66  38
4  66  58  54  55  14  15  82  31
5  45  94  95  16  99  99  36  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the 8 items among the 6 agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where possible, by considering each agent's valuations. Let's distribute the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0 and 5. We'll assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values items 3 and 2. We'll assign these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 does not have high preferences but values item 0 relatively more than others. However, item 0 is already allocated. Therefore, we'll assign item 4 to Agent 2, which is relatively higher.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 5, but it's already taken. Item 0 is also high but taken. Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as it's one of the higher available options left.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 6, but it's taken. Assign item 1 to Agent 4, which is their next highest available preference.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 4, but it's taken. Assign item 7 to Agent 5, which is the next highest choice available.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to minimize envy by assigning higher-valued items where possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7]
}
```
