Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  96  82  75  19  51   6  38
1  91  67  56  64  73  73  79  47
2  18   2  40  18  46   1  60  20
3  99  95  75  28  85  47  31  91
4  10  38  68  47  80  11  30  38
5  48  57  25  40  60  74  82  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider an approach that aims for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Given the valuations, we can use a method like the "Round Robin" or "Maximum Marginal Utility" approach to make allocations as fair as possible.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation for Each Item**: For each item, identify the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item is initially considered by the agent who values it the most.

2. **Round Robin Based on Highest Valuation**: Starting from the agent with the highest total valuation across all items, allocate one item per agent in a round-robin fashion based on their highest-preference items.

3. **Envy Check**: Ensure that no agent would prefer to have another agent's allocation given their preferences.

With this in mind, let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 1 most (96), so allocate item 1.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 most (91), so allocate item 0.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 6 most (60), so allocate item 6.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 3 most (28), so allocate item 3.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 4 most (80), so allocate item 4.
- **Agent 5**: Values item 5 most (74), so allocate item 5.
- Continue to allocate the remaining items based on remaining highest preferences and ensuring envy-freeness.

Finally, allocate the remaining items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

Note: The allocation is designed to balance the high-value items among agents while ensuring each agent receives items they value reasonably, reducing envy.
