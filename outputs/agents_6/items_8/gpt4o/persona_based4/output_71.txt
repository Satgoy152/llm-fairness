Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  54  56  75  30  91  80  84
1  53  85  36  26  90  96  28  43
2  95  35  89  27   9  28  35  28
3  84  22  49  63  21   7  84   1
4  37  49  14   8  58  49  25  40
5  84  94  92  87  43  82  89  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agentâ€™s bundle of items over their own, given their valuations.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 565
- Agent 1: 457
- Agent 2: 347
- Agent 3: 331
- Agent 4: 280
- Agent 5: 667

Given these valuations, a straightforward way to achieve an envy-free allocation is to try to allocate the items such that each agent gets items they value highly, and the total value of the items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible allocation that aims to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6] (Values: 95, 80)
- Agent 1: Items [5, 4] (Values: 96, 90)
- Agent 2: Items [2] (Values: 89)
- Agent 3: Items [3] (Values: 63)
- Agent 4: Items [7] (Values: 40)
- Agent 5: Items [1] (Values: 94)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and it attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation from their allocation.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This setup ensures that each agent has been assigned items based on their preferences, while all items have been allocated.
