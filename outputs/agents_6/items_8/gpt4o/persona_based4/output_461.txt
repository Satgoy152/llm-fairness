Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  73   1  28  22   3  91  95
1  42   2  43  54  81  51  87  24
2  62  36  65  73  46  32  55  18
3  26  48  10   4  75  97  53  27
4  20  95  24  68  67  54  10  43
5   7  38  72  31  32  93   7  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use an approach that considers maximizing the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach in fair division is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle.

Given the table of valuations, let's analyze the possible allocations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

After evaluating the table, here is a possible allocation of items to the agents:

- Agent 0: Allocated items that maximize their high valuations.
- Agent 1: Allocated items that balance high values and remaining items.
- Agent 2: Allocated items with middle-range values.
- Agent 3: Allocated items with higher values that are not highly contested.
- Agent 4: Allocated items that they value moderately and are less contested.
- Agent 5: Allocated items that fit remaining values.

Let's provide an allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed. Note that ensuring strict envy-freeness might not always be possible, but efforts are made to maximize fairness in division.
