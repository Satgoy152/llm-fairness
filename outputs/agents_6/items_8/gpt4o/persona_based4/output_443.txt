Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  62  52   2   4  90  41  54
1  38  16  70  18  48  39  53  18
2  68  86  45  44  17  51  41  15
3  27   4  35  10  17  93  91  91
4  59  30  38  60   8  68  39  71
5  75  46  20  94  28  23  86  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [75 46 20 94 28 23 86 77]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations in the table, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0** has high values for items 0 (94) and 5 (90). Let's allocate these to them.
- **Agent 1** has a high value for item 2 (70). We'll allocate this to them.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 (86) highly, so we'll allocate this to them.
- **Agent 3** values items 5 (93), 6 (91), and 7 (91) highly, but item 5 is already taken. Let's allocate items 6 and 7 to them.
- **Agent 4** values item 7 (71) highly, but since it's already taken, we'll allocate item 3 (60) to them.
- **Agent 5** values item 3 (94) highly, but it's already taken. We'll allocate item 4 (28) and the remaining item 1 (46) to them.

This allocation gives each agent at least one of their preferable items and aims to balance the overall distribution of value.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
