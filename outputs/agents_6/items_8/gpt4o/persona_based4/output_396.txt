Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  73  83  54  57  72  32  51
1   7  77  18  94  88  46  80  81
2  95  29  32  46  52  90  99   6
3  49  37  71  58   3  56  37  54
4  52  19  42  32   8  36  70  68
5  81  55  13   8  39  91  74   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for envy-freeness as much as possible, given that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated. This involves ensuring that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation.

Given the table of valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction relative to their preferences. Here's one possible allocation, considering both the values and trying to minimize envy:

Agent 0 values item 0 the highest.
Agent 1 values item 3 the highest.
Agent 2 values item 6 the highest.
Agent 3 values item 2 the highest.
Agent 4 values item 7 the highest.
Agent 5 values item 5 the highest.

These initial allocations focus on high-value items for each agent. Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 7
- Agent 5: Item 5

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 4. We choose based on maximizing satisfaction:

- Agent 0 would benefit from item 1 as well (high value).
- Agent 1 would benefit from item 4 (high value).

Here is the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's utility based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
