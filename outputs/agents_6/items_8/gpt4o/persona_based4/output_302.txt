Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  52   9  23  58   8  91  40
1  50  26  44  93  95  76  75  47
2  86  20  32  90  98  22   8  38
3  71  57  13  95   4  16  94  21
4  31   9  77  73  49  43  57  10
5  53  48  25  76  11  68  26  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or using a round-robin approach based on valuations. Here, I'll attempt to do a fair allocation using a method to balance the total value each agent receives. Let's start by distributing the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items with high value for them. Item 6 is very valuable to them.  
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 is very valuable, so allocate it to them.  
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4 is valuable, but already allocated to Agent 1. Item 0 is fairly valuable.  
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 is very valuable for them.  
5. **Agent 4**: Item 2 is the most valuable to them.  
6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 is the most valuable to them.  

Let's allocate based on the above consideration:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 0
- **Agent 3**: Item 3
- **Agent 4**: Item 2
- **Agent 5**: Item 5

Now, we have allocated 6 items. To allocate the remaining 2 items, consider the next high-value items for agents who received fewer valuable items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (next high-value item)
- **Agent 5**: Item 7 (next valuable item)

Now the allocation is complete:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5, 7]
}
```
