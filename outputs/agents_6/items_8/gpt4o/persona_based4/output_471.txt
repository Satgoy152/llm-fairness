Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  77  69  18  43  64  21  76
1  49  39  64  99   4  38   6   6
2  21  66  31  49  86  47  69  15
3  21  44  79  76  27  76   3  15
4  76  37  10  63  98  84  47   7
5   0  14  44   8  96  28  91  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as highly as they would value any other agent's allocation. Given the challenge of finding an envy-free allocation in this context, we can approximate fairness by trying to balance the value each agent gets.

We will proceed by trying to allocate items in a manner that maximizes each agent's perceived value, balancing the distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: High value on items 1, 2, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: High value on items 3.
3. **Agent 2**: High value on items 4 and 6.
4. **Agent 3**: High value on items 2, 3, 5.
5. **Agent 4**: High value on items 0, 4.
6. **Agent 5**: High value on items 4, 6.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 3).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for item 4).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (shared high value preference).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (highest value for item 0).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (highest value for item 6).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (second-highest value for item 2).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 7).

Here's how the allocation looks:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This distribution aims to maximize the perceived value for each agent based on their preferences, ensuring a fair distribution of the items. Each agent receives items that are highly valued by them, which is an attempt to maintain envy-freeness as closely as possible.
