Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  38  31  26  25  40  87  73
1  57  56  16  35  51  56  92  17
2  84  47  75  72  51  76  84  86
3  26  65  13  66  47  44  79  59
4  53  40  40  32  60  32  10  84
5  90   0  68  25  14   8  47  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we will aim to allocate items so that each agent perceives their allocation as favorable or at least as good as any other agent's allocation. With 6 agents and 8 items, each agent will not necessarily get the same number of items, but we will try to distribute them fairly based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the values each agent places on the items:

- Agent 0 values items highly: 6 (87), 5 (40), 7 (73)
- Agent 1 values items highly: 6 (92), 0 (57), 1 (56)
- Agent 2 values items highly: 0 (84), 6 (84), 7 (86)
- Agent 3 values items highly: 3 (66), 1 (65), 6 (79)
- Agent 4 values items highly: 7 (84), 4 (60)
- Agent 5 values items highly: 0 (90), 2 (68)

Given these preferences, let's make an allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 because they value it the highest.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 5 since they have the highest value for it.
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 4 because it’s their highest valuation.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it's their third-highest valuation and not yet allocated.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it's within their higher valuations, and not yet allocated.
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it’s their highest valuation and not yet allocated.
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because they have a high valuation for it.
8. Assign item 4 to Agent 4 since they value it.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [6, 1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [7, 4]
- Agent 5: [0]

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value while distributing all items.
