Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  31  80  30  92  86  57  49
1  30   4  53  69  54  55  60  94
2  45  33  94  26  29   0  39  63
3  97  46  41   9   9  91  60  21
4  27  74  83  81  83  72  76  14
5  40  94  73  96   2  69  73  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [40 94 73 96  2 69 73 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use an envy-free algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure or the round-robin method. For simplicity, let's use a heuristic approach aiming to balance the total valuation of items each agent receives.

We'll aim to assign each agent a subset of items such that the total value of items allocated to each agent is as equitable as possible, given the constraints. Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuation matrix:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [4, 6]  
   Total value: 92 + 57 = 149

2. **Agent 1**: Items [7]  
   Total value: 94

3. **Agent 2**: Items [2]  
   Total value: 94

4. **Agent 3**: Items [0, 5]  
   Total value: 97 + 91 = 188

5. **Agent 4**: Items [1, 3]  
   Total value: 74 + 81 = 155

6. **Agent 5**: Items []  
   Total value: 0

Now, presenting these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation received by each agent while ensuring that the distribution of items is complete and fair among the agents.
