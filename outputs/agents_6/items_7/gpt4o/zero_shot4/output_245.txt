Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  49  85  52  29  97  67
1  85  42  61  22  65  47  89
2  66   1  36   8  68  24  58
3  33  77  62  85  35  39  74
4  57  10  25  57  67  23  77
5  66  31  33  30  11  80   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we will try to ensure that each agent's allocation is as balanced as possible based on their valuations. This might mean that some agents receive items that are not their highest valued items, but the overall distribution is as equitable as possible.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 5 (97) and 2 (85). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued items are 0 (85) and 6 (89). Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued item is 4 (68). Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued items are 3 (85) and 1 (77). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valued item is 6 (77), but it's already taken. Next is item 4 (67), which is taken. Allocate item 0 (57) to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valued item is 5 (80), but it's taken. Next is item 0 (66), which is taken. Allocate item 1 (31) to Agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items. Items 2 (valued at 85 by Agent 0) and 1 (valued at 77 by Agent 3) are left.

- **Agent 0** already has item 5, so let's not give them another high-value item.
- **Agent 3** already has item 3, so let's not give them another high-value item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 to balance it somewhat with a higher value item.

Re-evaluate the remaining item 1:

- Item 1 can be allocated to **Agent 2** since it has a low value for them, which balances their allocation with others.

Finally, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives.
