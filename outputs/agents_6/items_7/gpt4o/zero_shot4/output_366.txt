Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  15  47  62  70  31  96
1  19  99  36  95  10  24  37
2  37  87  48  34   6   1  42
3  15  50  16  75  13  28  76
4  26  52  61  36  98  83  69
5  98   7  54  63  77  84  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98  7 54 63 77 84 30]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 6 agents and 7 items, so some agents will receive more than one item while others may receive none.

To start, let's assign items based on the highest valuation per item:

1. Item 0: Highest value by agent 5 (98)
2. Item 1: Highest value by agent 1 (99)
3. Item 2: Highest value by agent 0 (47)
4. Item 3: Highest value by agent 1 (95)
5. Item 4: Highest value by agent 4 (98)
6. Item 5: Highest value by agent 5 (84)
7. Item 6: Highest value by agent 0 (96)

Now, let's check the distribution and adjust to ensure all agents are considered:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Items 0, 5

This allocation gives all items to agents with the highest valuation, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```
