Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99   0  53  83  83  30  69
1   9  83  11  25  35  84  75
2  52  88  14  16  12  21  96
3  85  87  84  84  68  95  50
4  49  77  51   2  21  40   8
5  23  98   4  88  55   3  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item, aiming to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Does not have particularly high valuations, but can be assigned item 4 for balance.
6. **Agent 5**: Has the highest valuation for item 1.

Based on these observations, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [1]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent receiving items according to their preferences as much as possible.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
