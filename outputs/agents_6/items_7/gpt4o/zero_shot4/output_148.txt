Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  97  83  72  62  38  95
1  44  31  35  50  76  16  10
2  60  81  27  28  32  83   1
3  32  39  60  64  42  11  99
4  48  44  12  82  24  12  28
5  27   7  17  13  52  11   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent can receive an integer number of items. Given there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign the item each agent values the most (if not already taken).
2. Allocate remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's distribute the items:

- Agent 0: Values item 1 most (97), so assign item 1.
- Agent 1: Values item 4 most (76), so assign item 4.
- Agent 2: Values item 1 most (81), but it's taken; next highest is item 5 (83), so assign item 5.
- Agent 3: Values item 6 most (99), so assign item 6.
- Agent 4: Values item 3 most (82), so assign item 3.
- Agent 5: Values item 4 most (52), but it's taken; next highest is item 0 (27), so assign item 0.

Now, all items except item 2 are allocated. Assign item 2 to the agent with the lowest total current value:

- Agent 5 has only item 0 with value 27. Agent 2 has item 5 with value 83. Assign item 2 to Agent 5.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```
