Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  42  13  97  34  88  63
1   1  89   9  20  88  85  61
2  80  86  93  38  45  93  44
3  67  81  92   8  46  85  44
4  23   4  29  53  66  43  45
5  92  95  56  94  75  40  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [92 95 56 94 75 40 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (97), we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (89), so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values Item 2 the highest (93), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values Item 2 the highest (92), but since it's already taken, we allocate their second-highest valued item, Item 1 (81), but it's also taken, so we look at Item 5 (85) and allocate that to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values Item 4 the highest (66), so we allocate Item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values Item 1 the highest (95), but it's already taken. Next, they value Item 0 (92) the highest, so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 out of 7 items. We need to allocate one more item:

- **Item 6**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 63.
  - Agent 1 values it at 61.
  - Agent 2 values it at 44.
  - Agent 3 values it at 44.
  - Agent 4 values it at 45.
  - Agent 5 values it at 72.

Agent 5 values Item 6 the highest (72). Since Agent 5 currently has only one item, it might be fair to allocate Item 6 to Agent 5.

Given this allocation strategy, here is the resulting allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```
