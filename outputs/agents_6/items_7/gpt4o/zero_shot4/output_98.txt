Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  49  66  44  69  93  44
1  29  64   4  64  29  72   2
2  57  53  49   2  67  95  60
3  30   1  91  68  10  72  11
4  59  58  37  56  87  41  55
5  28  89  92  96  75   1  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We'll aim to maximize the total valuation for the agents. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 93. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 and item 3 both at 64. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 95, but since it's already assigned to agent 0, assign item 6 to agent 2, which they value at 60.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 91. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 87. Assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest at 96. Assign item 3 to agent 5.
7. The remaining item, item 0, which hasn't been allocated yet, can be assigned to Agent 0, as they value it decently at 66.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to one of the agents, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
