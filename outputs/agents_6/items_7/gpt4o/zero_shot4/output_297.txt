Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  72  89  87  55  65   3
1   0  37  73  69  68  38  24
2  90  79  14  80  16  58  18
3  65  84  94  48  78  92  26
4  25  61  28  39  94  82   9
5  73  65  99  49  84  15  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with exactly 7 items allocated in total. Given the constraints, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for items 5 and 6.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4, but since item 4 is better for agent 1, we'll allocate a less-valued item to agent 4.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 2, but since item 2 is better for agent 0, we'll allocate a less-valued item to agent 5.

Based on this, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 4: Item [1]
- Agent 5: No items

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.
