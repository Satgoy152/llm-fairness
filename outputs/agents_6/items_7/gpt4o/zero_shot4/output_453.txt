Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  71  91  65  67  82  26
1  67  89  21  66  41  16  42
2  76  67  79  12  27  49   7
3  87  52  68  27  18   6  22
4  76  75  88  95  99  53  13
5  28  39  71  75  58  39  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 71 91 65 67 82 26]
 [67 89 21 66 41 16 42]
 [76 67 79 12 27 49  7]
 [87 52 68 27 18  6 22]
 [76 75 88 95 99 53 13]
 [28 39 71 75 58 39 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations for each item by each agent and try to ensure that each agent receives items equitably in terms of total valuation. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets items 4 and 3.
- Agent 5 gets item 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item or has the opportunity to receive an item if their valuation is higher for that item compared to other agents. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This ensures all 7 items are allocated, and each agent is considered in the allocation.
