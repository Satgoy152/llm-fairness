Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  48  53  11  73  14  21
1  56   6  29  68  65  51  54
2  91  12  76  11  57  57  47
3  59  52  69  78  68  74  56
4  87   7  63  20  33  24  62
5  53  20  29  95  89  91  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method where each agent receives the items that they value the most. Since we have 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than one item at a time unless necessary due to the number of items and agents.

Here's one potential allocation based on the given values:

- Agent 0 receives item 0 (value 79).
- Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 68).
- Agent 2 receives item 2 (value 76).
- Agent 3 receives item 5 (value 74).
- Agent 4 receives item 6 (value 62).
- Agent 5 receives items 1 (value 20) and 4 (value 89) since they have high values for these items and some agents already have one item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly and utilizes all 7 items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```
