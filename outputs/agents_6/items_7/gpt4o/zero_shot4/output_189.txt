Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  33  38  64  86  80  40
1  38  98  83  71  52  16  90
2  80  66  47  50   4  52  15
3  83  79  33  60  47  83   9
4  59  95  14  11  75  71  69
5  21  84  73  82  36  52   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated. The table shows each agent's valuation for each item. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible, while ensuring each agent ends up with a fair share of items.

Let's go through the items and assign them based on the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 83.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 98.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 83.
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it at 82.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 80.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 90.

Now we must ensure each agent receives a fair allocation of items, considering there are 6 agents and 7 items. It may be necessary to adjust the allocations to ensure fairness and balance.

Here's one possible fair allocation:
- Agent 0: [4, 5]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [3, 6]

This allocation considers the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets items, even if some don't get any due to the constraints of the problem.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```
