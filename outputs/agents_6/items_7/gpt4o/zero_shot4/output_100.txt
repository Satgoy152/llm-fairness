Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  39  25   3   7  50  89
1  13  77  75  17   5  20  91
2  52  39  63  36  25  55  46
3  70  13  93  30  82  28  96
4  59  60  34  97  62  75  70
5   4  46  64  47   5  70  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a variety of strategies. One approach is to ensure that each agent receives the items they value the most where possible, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 7 and each item is only assigned to one agent. Let's break down the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (89), Item 0 (51)
   - Assign Item 6 (highest value).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (91), Item 1 (77)
   - Assign Item 1 (second highest value, as Item 6 is already given to Agent 0).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (52), Item 5 (55)
   - Assign Item 5 (highest available value).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (96), Item 2 (93)
   - Assign Item 2 (highest available value).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (97), Item 5 (75)
   - Assign Item 3 (highest available value).

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (70), Item 3 (47)
   - Assign Item 0 (highest available value).

Now, we have allocated 6 items. The only items left are Items 4 and 7. We need to assign one more item to reach a total of 7 items:

- [Remaining Items: 4]
- **Agent 4** has the next highest value for an unallocated item:
  - Assign Item 4 to Agent 4.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while all items are distributed and each item is assigned to only one agent.
