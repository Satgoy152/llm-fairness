Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  40  87  90  87  45  78
1  87  54  72  43  42  11  55
2  93  64   8  81  95  63  70
3  98  60  16   6  28  94  24
4  70  21  46  76  19  46  91
5  43  93  18   2  57  54  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. We'll proceed by assigning each agent their highest-valued item first and then distribute the remaining items to maximize their total valuation by considering the second and further highest-valued items.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 3 (value 90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (value 87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 4 (value 95).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 0, but it's taken. Next highest is item 5 (value 94).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 6 (value 91).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 1 (value 93).

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Item 2 is still unallocated.

Let's allocate item 2 to the agent with the next highest valuation for this item:

- **Agent 0** has the highest unallocated value for item 2 (value 87).

Now let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.
