Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  89  18  11   1  76  56
1  79  66  74  89  84   8  45
2  49  73  70  50  47   4   0
3  50  38  65  99  80  96  73
4  83  30   5  15  94  51  90
5  70  18  88   6  18  90  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we'll aim to give each agent at least one item if possible, while trying to maximize their total value. Let's go through the process of allocating items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (89)

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (89)

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (73)

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (99)
   - Since item 3 is already allocated, next highest: Item 5 (96)

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (94)

6. **Agent 5:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (88)

Now we have allocated 6 items. Let's allocate the remaining item:

- Agent 2 has only one item, which is also the case for others except agent 3. Check the next highest value for any unallocated items:
  - Agent 0: Item 0 (29)
  - Agent 1: Item 0 (79)
  - Agent 2: Item 0 (49)
  - Agent 3: Item 0 (50)
  - Agent 4: Item 0 (83)
  - Agent 5: Item 0 (70)

Agent 4 has the highest remaining value for item 0 (83), so allocate item 0 to agent 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 0],
    "5": [2]
}
```
