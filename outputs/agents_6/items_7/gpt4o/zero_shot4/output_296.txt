Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7   4  17  57  20  29  63
1  57  74   8  55  49  11  64
2  76  47  82  61  60   1  85
3  27  82  72  51  71  64  84
4  18  72  33  97  24  43  87
5  61   2  34  33  85  85  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are assigned. This type of problem can be approached with different fairness criteria, such as maximizing the sum of valuations or ensuring envy-freeness. Here, we'll try to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

1. Agent 2 has a very high valuation for item 2 (82). Assign item 2 to agent 2.
2. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 3 (97). Assign item 3 to agent 4.
3. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (74). Assign item 1 to agent 1.
4. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 6 (63). Assign item 6 to agent 0.
5. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5 (64). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 4 (85). Assign item 4 to agent 5.
7. For item 0, agent 2 has the highest valuation (76), but agent 0 also has a good valuation (7) and hasn't received many items yet. Assign item 0 to agent 0 to balance allocations.

Here is the fair allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each item is distributed, and agents receive their highest-valued items where possible.
