Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  56  74   5  73  57  70
1  41  15  23  72  35  16  45
2  13  41  16  97   1  28  24
3  72   9  18  64  73  60  85
4  83  20  27   8  48  61  95
5  58  59  35  16  44  94  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we will aim for a balanced distribution that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Given there are 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. We'll base the allocation on maximizing total valuations for each agent while ensuring fair distribution.

Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 0 (value 67).
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 3 (value 72).
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 6 (value 24).
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 5 (value 60).
5. **Agent 4**: Receives items 4 (value 48) and 1 (value 20).
6. **Agent 5**: Receives item 2 (value 35).

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items distributed is seven.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 1],
    "5": [2]
}
```
