Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  13  96  58  55   9  78
1   6  54  78  95  85  46  59
2  91  86  67  41  24  12  22
3  93  18  94  68  40  70  61
4  66   9  32  17  35  13   8
5  70  28  24  38  69  99  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction by considering the highest valuations. This approach aims to assign items to agents based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

Identify Highest Valuations: Determine which agent values each item the most.

Assign Items: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Adjust for Fairness: If any agent ends up with no items, reallocate items to ensure each agent receives at least one, if the context allows such flexibility.

Allocation Steps:
Item 0: Highest value by Agent 3 (93)
Item 1: Highest value by Agent 2 (86)
Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (96)
Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (95)
Item 4: Highest value by Agent 1 (85)
Item 5: Highest value by Agent 5 (99)
Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (78)
Adjust for fairness if needed and ensure distribution:

Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 instead of Agent 3 to balance the distribution.
Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```
This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item where possible.
