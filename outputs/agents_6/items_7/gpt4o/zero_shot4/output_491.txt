Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  20  31  91  19  70  69
1  75  72  92  11  94  88  11
2  76  94  11  38  55  28  23
3  12   2  27  20  73  71  85
4  82  70  78   2   1  75  96
5  52  56   5   8   7  89  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We have 7 items and each agent may receive 0 to all 7 items.

Let's consider how to distribute the items by maximizing the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Preferred items (highest to lowest valuation): 3 (91), 5 (70), 6 (69)
   - Allocate item 3 (value: 91)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Preferred items: 4 (94), 2 (92), 5 (88)
   - Allocate item 4 (value: 94)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Preferred items: 1 (94), 0 (76), 4 (55)
   - Allocate item 1 (value: 94)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Preferred items: 6 (85), 5 (71), 4 (73)
   - Allocate item 6 (value: 85)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Preferred items: 6 (96), 0 (82), 2 (78)
   - Allocate item 2 (value: 78)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Preferred items: 5 (89), 6 (89), 1 (56)
   - Allocate item 5 (value: 89)

This leaves us with item 0. To allocate it, we can look at the remaining highest valuations for item 0:

- Agent 4 has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (82).

Given these allocations, here is the final distribution in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
