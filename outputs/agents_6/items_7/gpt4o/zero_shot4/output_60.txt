Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  68  49  91  75  95  83
1  46  61  11  26  69  80  70
2  96  46  75  28   6  16  54
3  72  49  12  44  83  77  55
4  73  84  30   5   3  52  25
5  27  60  86  26  85  10  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that the total valuations of items received by each agent are roughly balanced. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

- Determine the total valuation for all items for each agent.
- Sort or prioritize allocations based on the highest valuations to balance the distribution among agents.
  
Let's analyze and allocate the items:

### Initial Analysis:
- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 5, 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for item 5.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for item 0.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for item 4.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for item 1.
- Agent 5 has high valuations for item 2 and 4.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign each agent one of their highest value item to ensure fairness.
- Ensure no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (highest available value for Agent 1).
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (highest available value for Agent 3).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 4 (highest available value for Agent 4).
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 5 (highest available value for Agent 5).
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).

This ensures each agent gets at least one item and the valuations are somewhat balanced.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuation, making the allocation fair.
