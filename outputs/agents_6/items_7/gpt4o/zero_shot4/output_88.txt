Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  81  38  37   3  94  22
1  50  44  92  51  54  81  85
2  79  60  23  97  51  19  39
3  61   5  43  20  17   4  47
4  30  37  97  64  79  39  76
5  66  43  92  12  10  92  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Given there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. The goal is to maximize overall satisfaction by considering the valuations provided.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent an item that they value the most.
2. For the agent who will receive two items, select the second item based on the next highest valuation among the remaining items.

By examining the table:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (94).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (92).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (97).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (61).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (97), but since item 2 is already taken, the next highest is item 4 (79).
- Agent 5 values item 2 the highest (92), but since item 2 is already taken, the next highest is item 5 (92).

Now, we have the following items allocated:  
- Item 5 to Agent 0  
- Item 2 to Agent 1  
- Item 3 to Agent 2  
- Item 0 to Agent 3  
- Item 4 to Agent 4  
- Item 5 already allocated, so Agent 5 takes item 6 (34)  

Agent 0 needs another item since they had the highest remaining valuation for an unallocated item, which is item 1 (81).

Therefore, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
