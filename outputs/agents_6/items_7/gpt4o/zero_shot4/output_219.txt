Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  96  61  94  42  93  74
1  51  88  75  58   4  65  91
2  73  32  76  93  99  90  21
3  15  91  66  34  55   2  48
4  68  20  15  87  11  91   7
5  99  40  85  34  42  81  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all 7 items are allocated. Given the constraint of integer allocations, each agent may not receive an equal number of items, but we'll aim for a balanced distribution.

We'll utilize the following steps:
1. Calculate the maximum value each agent can achieve by possibly selecting the highest valued items for that agent.
2. Allocate items iteratively while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and that all items are distributed.

Here is an allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [1, 3]
   - Values: 96 (Item 1), 94 (Item 3)
   - Total value: 190

2. **Agent 1**: Item [6]
   - Values: 91 (Item 6)
   - Total value: 91

3. **Agent 2**: Item [4]
   - Values: 99 (Item 4)
   - Total value: 99

4. **Agent 3**: Item [0]
   - Values: 15 (Item 0)
   - Total value: 15

5. **Agent 4**: Item [5]
   - Values: 91 (Item 5)
   - Total value: 91

6. **Agent 5**: Item [2]
   - Values: 85 (Item 2)
   - Total value: 85

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
