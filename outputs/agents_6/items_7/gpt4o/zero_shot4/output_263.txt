Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  14  52   4  85  30  30
1  53  49   0  20  13  79  43
2   2  51  25  20   6  28   6
3  60  72  53  83  69  25  30
4  83   9  24  43  48  44  49
5  85   8  59  26  29  24  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation of items for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. One common approach is to use the "Hungarian algorithm" or similar optimization methods to find an optimal assignment. However, without implementing a full optimization algorithm here, I can attempt a heuristic allocation based on the highest valuations for simplicity.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 4 (85).
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0 (53).
3. Agent 2 has a moderate valuation for item 1 (51).
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3 (83).
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 0 (83), but since it's already taken, we'll allocate item 6 (49).
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 0 (85), but since it's already taken, we'll allocate item 2 (59).

Let's adjust to ensure all items are allocated:

1. Agent 0: Item 5 (30) since it is still available.
2. Agent 1: Item 3 (20) since it is still available.
3. Agent 2: Item 6 (6) since it is still available.
4. Agent 3: Item 1 (72) since it is still available.
5. Agent 4: Item 4 (48) since it is still available.
6. Agent 5: Item 2 (59).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item while trying to maximize their valuations.
