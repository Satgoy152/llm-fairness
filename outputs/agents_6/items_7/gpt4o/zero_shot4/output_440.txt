Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  81  76  77  97  57  44
1  29  17  15   5  28  88  19
2  47  41  94  93  99  30   2
3  73  86  46  28  27  58  33
4  29  28  88  66  72  97  57
5  51  72  93  21   0  94  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocations maximize the total valuation. A simple heuristic approach to this problem is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. If an agent already has an item, consider the next highest valuation for that item.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation based on this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (69), assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most (86), assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (94), assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it second most (93), but since agent 2 already has one item, assign item 3 to the next highest, agent 0 (77).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (99), but since agent 2 already has one item, assign item 4 to the next highest, agent 0 (97).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (88), assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (74), assign item 6 to agent 5.

Now, let's make sure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [6]

Agent 4 does not have any items. We need to make sure each agent gets at least one item. Let's reallocate by moving one item to agent 4.

Reallocate item 4 (valued at 72 by agent 4) from agent 0 to agent 4.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [6]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
