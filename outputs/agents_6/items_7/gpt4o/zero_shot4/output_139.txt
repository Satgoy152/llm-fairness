Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  26  87  74  97  30  11
1  70  84  34  55  40  16  28
2  73  79  26  96   8  27  22
3  74  10   3  23   6  95  57
4  79  69  13  96  57  51  51
5  41  89  29  64  46  27  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible approach to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, by reallocating items if necessary.
3. Verify that all items are allocated.

Following these steps, here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 4 (value 79)
2. Item 1: Agent 5 (value 89)
3. Item 2: Agent 0 (value 87)
4. Item 3: Agent 2 (value 96)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 (value 97)
6. Item 5: Agent 3 (value 95)
7. Item 6: Agent 5 (value 66)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust if necessary.

- Agent 4 has item 0.
- Agent 5 has items 1 and 6.
- Agent 0 has items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 has item 3.
- Agent 3 has item 5.
- Agent 1 currently has no items, so we need to allocate an item to Agent 1.

To ensure that Agent 1 receives an item, we can reallocate item 1 from Agent 5 to Agent 1, who values it highly at 84.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
