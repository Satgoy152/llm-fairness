Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  62  30  22  75  59  64
1  14  98  81  90  85  72  31
2  97  30  52  86  12  22  56
3   5   3  69  84  52  95   5
4  29  86  81  91  67  89  60
5   2  99  48  79  32  51  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that involves maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We'll aim to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is for item 4 (value of 75).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is for item 1 (value of 98).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is for item 0 (value of 97).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is for item 5 (value of 95).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is for item 3 (value of 91).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation for Agent 5 is for item 2 (value of 48).

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We still need to allocate one more item while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share.

7. **Remaining Item**: The remaining item is item 6. Among the agents who have not yet received their second-highest valued item, Agent 5 values item 6 the highest (value of 89).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```
