Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  93  11  40   3  23  90
1  39  89  22  26  67  30  60
2  17   5  62  15  30  21  68
3   8  74  64  47  84  42  88
4  24  61  27  59  81  33  29
5  20  35  88  47  54  12  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. One approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If there's a tie, choose the agent with the fewest items assigned so far.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item when possible.

Following this approach:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 0 (value: 20).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (value: 93).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 5 (value: 88).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 3 (value: 47).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 3 (value: 84).
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 0 (value: 23).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 3 (value: 88).

However, this gives Agent 3 too many items, so we need to adjust:

- Reassign item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 4, who values it second highest (value: 33).
- Reassign item 6 from Agent 3 to Agent 2, who values it second highest (value: 68).

Here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent, and we distribute the items fairly considering the valuations.
