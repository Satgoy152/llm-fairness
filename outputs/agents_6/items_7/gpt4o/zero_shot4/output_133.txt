Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  81   3  84  51  83   1
1  41  52  47  47  37  38  35
2  31  26  48  37  39  94  76
3  16  57  86  62  41  80  25
4  54  63  36  64  93  93  54
5  67  18  45  67  20  73  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 7 items in total are allocated, we need to consider the valuations provided. We'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value the most, while also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item when possible and the allocation remains fair.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 and 5 highly (84 and 83), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 (52) the highest, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 (94) the highest, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 (86) the highest, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 (93) the highest, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 (67) the highest, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 5.

There is one item left, item 6, which has not been allocated yet. We need to allocate item 6 to one of the agents. Agent 2 values item 6 (76) fairly high, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, each agent receives an integer number of items, and we have respected the preferences of the agents to the best extent possible given the constraints.
