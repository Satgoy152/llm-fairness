Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  37  84  65   3  84  72
1  82  78  34  38  81  91  59
2   4  96  95  49  30  47  61
3  68  18  85  60  11  90  14
4  17   2  55  81  61  50   6
5   4  56  35  57  15  82  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. One approach to achieve this is to carry out a greedy allocation process, where we assign items to agents based on the highest valuation until all items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and making allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0, 2, 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 5, 1, 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 1, 2, 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 5, 2, 0.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 3, 4, 5.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 5, 3, 6.

Given that we have 7 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally get at least one item. We need to ensure each agent gets an item while potentially maximizing their valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign **item 0** to **Agent 0** (valuation = 84)
- Assign **item 1** to **Agent 2** (valuation = 96)
- Assign **item 2** to **Agent 3** (valuation = 85)
- Assign **item 3** to **Agent 4** (valuation = 81)
- Assign **item 4** to **Agent 1** (valuation = 81)
- Assign **item 5** to **Agent 5** (valuation = 82)
- Assign **item 6** to **Agent 0** (valuation = 72) as a second item since Agent 0 has high valuations for multiple items.

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and a total of 7 items are allocated.
