Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  92  56   3  89  31  82
1  73  89  28  44  36  17  60
2  51  11  75  23  94   5  70
3  22  39  67   1  21  61   9
4  34   2  24  80  69   2  98
5  41  18  39  58  98  42  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to distribute the items based on their values to each agent. Each agent should get at least one item, as there are 7 items and 6 agents. We'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring an even distribution of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for item 1 and moderate for item 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 the highest.
6. **Agent 5** values item 4 the highest.

To distribute fairly, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1]
  - The highest sum of values for agent 0 comes from items 0 and 1.
  
- **Agent 1**: Item [2]
  - Item 2 is the highest unclaimed value for agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: Item [4]
  - Item 4 is the highest value for agent 2.

- **Agent 3**: Item [5]
  - Item 5 is the highest value for agent 3.

- **Agent 4**: Item [6]
  - Item 6 is the highest value for agent 4.

- **Agent 5**: Item [3]
  - Leftover item 3 is allocated to agent 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed. Now, I will present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```
