Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  97  42   7  32  86  67
1  90  82  47   2  88  56  44
2  86   6  90  48  19  26  93
3  75  96  65   3  60  52  45
4  50  94  22  51  66  81  51
5  64  32  95  85  32  29   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86  6 90 48 19 26 93]

 [64 32 95 85 32 29  2]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the sum of valuations or ensuring each agent gets at least one high-valued item. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Identify high-value preferences for each agent.
2. Try to allocate items so that each agent gets items with relatively high valuations according to their preferences.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated among the agents.

Based on the given table, here is one possible fair allocation of the items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 2 highly.

Now, let's allocate these items based on their high valuations:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4, 5]
- Agent 5: [2]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and each agent gets at least one item that they value relatively highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
