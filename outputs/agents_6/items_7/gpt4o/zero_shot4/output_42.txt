Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  85   9  52  33  64  70
1  18  76  96   8  47  76  62
2  27  53  33  62  42  35  71
3  27  32  60  13  22  27  49
4  46  46  48   6  98  83   4
5  36  10  89  59  38  91  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to assign items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives while attempting to distribute the items as evenly as possible. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, some agents may receive more items than others. Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so we can assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly, so we can assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly, so we can assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so we can assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly, so we can assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly, so we can assign item 5 to Agent 5.
- Finally, item 0 is unassigned. Agent 0 has a reasonable valuation for item 0, so we can assign item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item to maximize their total value, with some agents receiving more than others. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
