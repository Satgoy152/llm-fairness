Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  32  99  32  74  71  59
1  72  21  13  10  92  36  68
2  64   3  12  94  72  61   2
3  57  11  46  90   6   8  30
4  10  21  43  83  39  32  67
5  50  41  84  77  44  15  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64  3 12 94 72 61  2]

 [10 21 43 83 39 32 67]
 [50 41 84 77 44 15 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. However, with 6 agents and 7 items, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

Let's start by analyzing the valuation matrix and make allocations based on maximizing the value for each agent:

```
0  18  32  99  32  74  71  59
1  72  21  13  10  92  36  68
2  64   3  12  94  72  61   2
3  57  11  46  90   6   8  30
4  10  21  43  83  39  32  67
5  50  41  84  77  44  15  92
```

Based on these valuations, let's make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 2 (99) - Highest valuation for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (92) - Highest valuation for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (94) - Highest valuation for agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 0 (57) - Highest valuation for agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Item 6 (67) - Highest valuation for agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 (15) - This is not the highest but assigns an item, leaving the best available.
7. **Agent 5**: Item 1 (41) - Remaining item with a fair valuation to balance allocation.

Now, each agent receives at least one item, with agent 5 receiving two items. This ensures that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
