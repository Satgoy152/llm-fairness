Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74   1  44   5  18   3  78
1  21  63   2  24  81   2  75
2  95  18  31  62  84  30  44
3   6  58  28  40  45  64  92
4  20  54  52  57   5  40  80
5  99   2  44  20  49  17  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for agent 0 is item 6 (value 78).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for agent 1 is item 4 (value 81).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for agent 2 is item 0 (value 95).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for agent 3 is item 6, but it's already taken, so the next highest is item 5 (value 64).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for agent 4 is item 6, but it's taken, so the next highest available is item 3 (value 57).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for agent 5 is item 0, which is taken, so the next highest available is item 2 (value 44).

After this initial allocation, we still have items 1 and 3 unallocated. We can allocate these remaining items based on the next highest value available:

- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 58) is the next highest value for agent 3.
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 24) is available and gives value to agent 1.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2]
}
```

Each agent receives a fair allocation based on their highest-valued items, and all 7 items are allocated.
