Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  99  30  87  73  45  53
1  89  16  41  40   4  43  64
2  51  84  90  84  71  88  82
3  91  42  36  71  72  58  90
4  94  67  72   6  75  20   6
5  76  90  83  47  40  75  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. One potential method is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items 0, 3 (values 61 and 87)
2. Agent 1: Item 6 (value 64)
3. Agent 2: Item 2 (value 90)
4. Agent 3: Item 5 (value 58)
5. Agent 4: Item 4 (value 75)
6. Agent 5: Item 1 (value 90)

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed, with no agent being left out. Note that this is just one of the possible allocations, and there may be other allocations that also meet the criteria.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
