Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  38  55  11  11  94  50
1  29  33  64  28  32  52  65
2   7  89  58  28  44  54  94
3  99  31  17  18  59  85  32
4  83  52  87  87   0  73  36
5  65  98  72  15  87   6  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple rule: each agent should ideally get one item, and then distribute the remaining item(s) based on the highest preference or valuation. However, since we have 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive an additional item. We will aim to allocate items to maximize the total valuation.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation.
2. Allocate the remaining item to an agent who has the highest unmet valuation.

Let's look at the valuations to determine the best allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (94).
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly (64).
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly (94).
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly (99).
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly (87).
- Agent 5 values item 1 highly (98).

To address the remaining item, we can look at the next highest unmet valuations:

- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 3 (87).

Now, let's allocate:

- Agent 0 receives item 5.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 6.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.
- Agent 4 receives item 4.
- Agent 5 receives items 1 and 3.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
