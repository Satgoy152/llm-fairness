Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  29  86  54  67  65  55
1  77  79  52  37  19  56  54
2  92  13  41  53  64  89  67
3  14  71  19  62  68  80  30
4  22  94  60  36  66  83  84
5  78  82   2  37   6  20  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [22 94 60 36 66 83 84]
 [78 82  2 37  6 20 21]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Let's strategically distribute the items based on agent valuations:

1. **Assign the highest value item to the respective agent who values it the most.**
2. **Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.**
3. **Maximize the total valuation for each agent.**

Using this strategy, we can derive a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (value 65), Item 6 (value 55)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 77), Item 3 (value 37)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 64)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 71)
- **Agent 4**: Item 2 (value 60)
- **Agent 5**: No items

Now let's format this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
