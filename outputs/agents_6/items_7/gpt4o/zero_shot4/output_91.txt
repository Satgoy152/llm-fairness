Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  18  23  16  27  51  66
1  39   6  87  21  37  94  44
2  61  66   4  84  79   5  23
3  20  12  51  36  45  66  58
4  38  67  85  32  68  93  18
5  64  68  78  87  63  59  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them items they value highly. We will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's overall valuation is balanced. Here's one way to do it:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most, but since it's already taken, we'll consider item 6.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the most, but since it's already taken, we'll consider item 2.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the most, but since it's already taken, we'll consider item 1.

Now, let's make sure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.
- Agent 5 gets item 1.

This leaves item 4 unallocated, which can be given to Agent 4 to balance the distribution further.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
