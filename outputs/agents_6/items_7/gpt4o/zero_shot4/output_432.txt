Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  49  99   3  54  66  58
1  48  46  14  99  18  42  50
2  43  97  36  89  95  67  39
3  42  10  95  35  70  77  12
4   0  46  10  26  98  14  74
5  29  97  39  46  61  33  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation, while also considering fairness, such as maximizing the minimum individual valuation or ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

1. Calculate the sum of valuations for each item across all agents.
2. Assign items to agents starting with the highest individual valuations for each item.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

After analyzing the data, here is a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (Value 80)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (Value 99)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (Value 95)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (Value 95)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (Value 74)
- Agent 5: Items 1 and 5 (Total Value 97 + 33 = 130)

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
