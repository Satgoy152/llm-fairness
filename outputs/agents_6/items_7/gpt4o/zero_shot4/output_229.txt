Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  14  21  92   9  94   0
1  32  61   2  76  75  69  35
2  95  98  37  35  25  47  49
3  68  48  44  24  24  98   1
4  22  15  59  57   3  18  66
5  75  28  55  88  47  47  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider how to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive around 1 item, with one agent receiving 2 items.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 highly with a value of 94. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly with a value of 61. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 highly with a value of 95. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 highly, but it is already allocated. The next highest value is item 3 with a value of 24. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 highly with a value of 66. Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 highly, but it is already allocated. The next highest value is item 4 with a value of 47. Assign item 4 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6). We need to allocate one more item, item 2, which has not been allocated yet. Checking the remaining agents:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 2 with 21.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 2 with 2.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 2 with 37.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 2 with 44.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 2 with 59.
- **Agent 5**: Values item 2 with 55.

Agent 4 values item 2 the highest among those without a second item. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 2],
    "5": [4]
}
```
