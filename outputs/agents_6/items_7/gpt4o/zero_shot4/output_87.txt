Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  64  35  14  87  28  55
1  35  12  88  62  62  87  44
2  35  57  88  81  89  70  65
3   0  70  18  23   5  72   9
4  96   2   3  42  73  50  66
5  58  76  77  49   9   0  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 2 64 35 14 87 28 55]
 [35 12 88 62 62 87 44]
 [35 57 88 81 89 70 65]
 [ 0 70 18 23  5 72  9]
 [96  2  3 42 73 50 66]
 [58 76 77 49  9  0 48]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for the agents. A straightforward approach is to use a greedy strategy, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. 

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (96).
2. Item 1: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (76).
3. Item 2: Agents 1 and 2 both have the highest valuation (88). We can assign it to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (81).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (89).
6. Item 5: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (72).
7. Item 6: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (66).

After allocating based on these valuations, we can check the distribution:

- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Items 0, 6
- Agent 5: Item 1

Here is the JSON representation of these allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [1]
}
```
