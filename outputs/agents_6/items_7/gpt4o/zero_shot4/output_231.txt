Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  31  96  50  46  41  51
1  59  71  70  63  33  91  83
2  76  29  14  96  65  12  83
3   8  40  72   8  12  18  52
4  52  28  88  29  28  19  90
5  61  85  79  98  97  30  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to assign items to agents such that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall assignment maximizes the total valuation. Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value they assign is to item 2 (value 96). Let's allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value they assign is to item 5 (value 91). Let's allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value they assign is to item 3 (value 96). Let's allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value they assign is to item 2 and item 3 (both value 72), but item 2 is already taken. The next highest value is item 6 (value 52). Let's allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value they assign is to item 6 (value 90), but item 6 is already taken. The next highest value is item 2 (value 88), but item 2 is also taken. The next highest value is item 0 (value 52). Let's allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value they assign is to item 3 (value 98), but item 3 is already taken. The next highest value is item 4 (value 97). Let's allocate item 4 to agent 5.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Items allocated: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Remaining item: 1

For the remaining item 1, we can assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for it that hasn't exceeded their fair share. Based on the remaining valuations:

- Agent 1 values item 1 at 71.
- Let's allocate item 1 to agent 1.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.
