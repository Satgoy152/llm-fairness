Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  74   4  76  14  37  71
1   4  47  65  79  51  53  85
2  36  50  29  94  87  47  32
3  65  92  15  16  38  71   4
4  55  78   4  42  74  92  69
5  46  59  96  90  48  28  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items such that the allocations are optimized based on these valuations. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives, given that each agent can receive an integer number of items and only 7 items in total are distributed.

Here's one possible fair allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for any item and allocate that item to the respective agent, ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.

2. If there are remaining items, allocate them to the agents who have not received any items yet, based on their next highest valuations.

Following this method, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6 (Values: 76, 71)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (Value: 51)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (Value: 47)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (Value: 92)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (Value: 55)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (Value: 96)

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations possible without overlap.
