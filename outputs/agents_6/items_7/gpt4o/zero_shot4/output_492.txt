Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  38  21  59   3  30  11
1  44  43  25  74  66  97  61
2  57  62  40  97  14  44   8
3  88  53  63  60  45  68  37
4  49  19  56  14  43  44  80
5  39  27  73  78  79  38  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will end up with two items, while the others will receive one item each.

Here is one possible allocation that tries to maximize fairness:

1. Assign the item with the highest value for each agent first.
2. Allocate an additional item to the agent who would benefit the most from a second item.

Following this approach, the allocations are:

- Agent 0 receives item 3 (value 59).
- Agent 1 receives item 5 (value 97).
- Agent 2 receives item 1 (value 62).
- Agent 3 receives item 0 (value 88).
- Agent 4 receives item 6 (value 80).
- Agent 5 receives item 4 (value 79).
- The remaining item 2 is allocated to Agent 5, as it provides a high additional value.

Here's the JSON representation of these allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 2]
}
```
