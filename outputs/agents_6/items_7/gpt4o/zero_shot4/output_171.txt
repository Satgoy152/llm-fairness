Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  19  42   3  22  22  91
1  46  69  99  38  90  94   8
2  74  74   0  96  13  70  51
3  71  19  17  97  56  51  22
4  87   4  22  47  20   6  60
5  18  90  75  99  12  69  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [18 90 75 99 12 69 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are assigned. A common approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring no agent receives more than one item initially. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation with 87.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 5 has the highest valuation with 90.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation with 99.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 5 has the highest valuation with 99. Since Agent 5 already has an item, we will allocate it to the next highest, which is Agent 3 with 97.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation with 90. Since Agent 1 already has an item, we allocate it to the next highest, which is Agent 3 with 56.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation with 94. Since Agent 1 and Agent 3 already have items, we allocate it to the next agent, which is Agent 2 with 70.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation with 91.

After these allocations, we verify that each agent receives a fair share, and no agent gets more than one item initially, ensuring all 7 items are distributed.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```
