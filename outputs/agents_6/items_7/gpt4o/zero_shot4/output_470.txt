Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  10  44  19  38  89  21
1  66  94  59  33  97   8  87
2  44  81   2  64  12  82  61
3  75  63  94  27   0  93  54
4   1  12  67  49  20  38  40
5  35  33  48  81   7  72  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 10 44 19 38 89 21]
 [66 94 59 33 97  8 87]
 [44 81  2 64 12 82 61]
 [75 63 94 27  0 93 54]
 [ 1 12 67 49 20 38 40]
 [35 33 48 81  7 72 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the given valuations, we can use a strategy where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This is a simple approach to ensure that each agent receives the items that are most valuable to them. Let's go through the table and assign each item:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value 66).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value 94).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (value 94).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 5 (value 81).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value 97).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (value 89).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value 87).

Now, let's assign these items to the agents:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 4, 6]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [3]

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it most, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3]
}
```
