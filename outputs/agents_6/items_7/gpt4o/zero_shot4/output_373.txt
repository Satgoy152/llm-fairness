Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  66  10   0   3   2  19
1  93  15   1  27  34  23  44
2  35  88   0  85  19  85  35
3  44  49  11  15  16  23   2
4  80  85  79  34  41  90  49
5   0  98  18  48  24  20  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [35 88  0 85 19 85 35]

 [ 0 98 18 48 24 20 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can consider the valuations table to assign the items to the agents who value them the most.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 93)
2. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 5 (value 98)
3. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 4 (value 79)
4. **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 2 (value 85)
5. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 4 (value 41)
6. **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 4 (value 90)
7. **Item 6**: Assign to Agent 1 (value 44)

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it highly, while also ensuring all items are distributed. Some agents might get no items if they do not have high valuations compared to others.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 4, 5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
