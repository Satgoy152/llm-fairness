Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  48  33   1  35   7   0
1  85  38  48  55  25  41  89
2  39  69   7  96   0  65  40
3  13  12  32  65  22  28  64
4  23  61  32  32   4  51  55
5  45  26  89   2  36  47  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic that tries to maximize the total valuation assigned to each agent. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 85.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 69.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 5 values it the most at 89.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 35.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 65.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 89.

However, this leads to Agent 2 having 3 items, which is not an even distribution. Let's adjust for a fairer allocation:

- **Item 1** can go to Agent 0 (48), the second-highest valuation after Agent 2.
- **Item 5** can go to Agent 4 (51), the second-highest valuation after Agent 2.

Now each agent should have at most one item, ensuring a fair distribution:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0
3. **Item 2**: Agent 5
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1

Now, let's present this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
