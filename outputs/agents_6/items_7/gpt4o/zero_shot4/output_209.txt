Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  76  29  43  41  75  82
1  81  91   7  63  86  90  24
2  50  64  67   7  25  74   8
3  32   0  64  95  50   0   8
4  17  48  69  56   5  70  68
5  15  68  48  78  69  58  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuation of the items. We have 6 agents and 7 items, meaning at least one agent will receive more than one item. 

Let's try to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent, while ensuring every item is allocated and no agent receives more than necessary unless it is unavoidable.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (value 82)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 91)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (value 74)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 95)
- Agent 4: Item 2 (value 69)
- Agent 5: Items 0 (value 15) and 4 (value 69)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item based on high valuations and ensures all items are fairly distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```
