Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  24  51  41  60  78  82
1  28  89  89  91  18  30  50
2  89  48  33  76  91  70  30
3  52  44  62  65  71  27  11
4  12  86  85  66  95  36  39
5  90  70  25  84   9  96  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent receives one or more items based on their valuations, aiming to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign the item that each agent values the highest to them first. If there is a conflict (i.e., two agents have the same maximum-valued item), assign it to the agent who values it slightly more or choose based on secondary high valuations.
2. Distribute the remaining items to ensure every agent receives at least one item.

Following this approach, we can have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```

- Agent 0 gets item 6, which they value at 82.
- Agent 1 gets item 3, which they value at 91.
- Agent 2 gets item 4, which they value at 91.
- Agent 3 gets item 0, which they value at 52.
- Agent 4 gets item 1, which they value at 86.
- Agent 5 gets items 2 and 5, which they value at 25 and 96 respectively.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.
