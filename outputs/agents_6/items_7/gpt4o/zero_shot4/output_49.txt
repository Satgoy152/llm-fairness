Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  63  94  90  34  97  51
1  40  29  21  25  20  64  49
2  50  79  15   7  24  35  10
3  12  52  61  77  20  49  61
4  87  66  65   3  11  62  32
5  91  96  19  26  99  30  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

- Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent if they haven't reached a reasonable balance of items compared to others.
- Ensure that no more than one item is assigned to any agent unless others have at least one item or when all agents have been considered, redistribute if necessary.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (97) and should get it.
- Agent 1 values item 0 reasonably high (40) and should get it.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly (79) and should get it.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly (77) and should get it.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly (65) and should get it.
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly (99) and should get it.
- For item 6, agent 3 and 0 both value it at 61 and 51 respectively, but agent 3 already has an item, so we allocate this to agent 0.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```
