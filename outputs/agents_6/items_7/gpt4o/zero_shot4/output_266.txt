Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  13   4  22  37   5   0
1  12  37  34  96  66  46  53
2  22  78  34  93  25  20  61
3  90  21  65   0  82  48  11
4  55  48   2  40  77  54  12
5  44  64  93  59  56  81  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the agents receive a fair share based on their preferences. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step process for allocating the items:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: For each item, find the agent who values it the most.

2. **Allocate Items**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If an agent ends up with multiple items while others have none, consider reallocating based on the next highest valuations to ensure all agents receive an item.

Here is an allocation based on the above strategy:

- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 3.
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 2.
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 5.
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 1.
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 1.
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 5.
- Item 6 is most valued by Agent 5.

Now let's assign the items:

1. Agent 3 gets Item 0.
2. Agent 2 gets Item 1.
3. Agent 5 gets Items 2, 5, and 6.
4. Agent 1 gets Items 3 and 4.
5. Agents 0 and 4 will not receive any items as they have the lowest valuations compared to others.

The allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and the agents receive items based on their preferences as much as possible.
