Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  38  36  85  77  68  24
1  81   9  43   4  10  36  98
2  69  19  73  12  61  42  93
3  71  42  22  43  78  89  86
4  66  17  78  81  82  70  34
5  30  86  80  87  69  86  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. One common approach is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each gets a reasonable share of the items. Given the constraint that we need to allocate exactly 7 items, here's one way to do it:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it highly (85).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 5, since agent 5 values it highly (86).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it highly (81).
4. Assign item 6 to agent 3, since agent 3 values it highly (86).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4, since agent 4 values it highly (82).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it highly (73).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 5, since agent 5 values it highly (86).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item that they value highly, while also distributing the items fairly across all agents. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
