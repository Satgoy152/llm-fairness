Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  56  14  18  93  67  48
1  40  41  54  28  15  70   3
2  90  24  90  71  39  84   8
3  56   7  67  85  29  37  10
4  12  31  55  88  24  75  72
5  65  28  59  92  24  18  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value. One common approach is the max-min fairness, where we aim to maximize the minimum valuation each agent gets. This often results in a more equitable distribution of items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Compute Total Value for Each Agent**: Calculate the sum of valuations for all items for each agent to understand their overall valuation preference.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**: Initially allocate each item to the agent that values it the most. This might not be the final allocation but serves as a starting point.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Adjust the allocation iteratively to ensure fairness, such as by swapping items between agents to improve the minimum value that the least satisfied agent receives.

To implement this:

- Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuation.
- Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
- Adjust allocations to balance total valuations as equally as possible.

Here's a possible fair allocation based on the given valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

Explanation:

- Agent 0 gets item 4, which they value the highest (93).
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 5, which are among their higher valuations.
- Agent 2 gets item 0, which they value highly (90).
- Agent 3 gets item 3, which they value at 85.
- Agent 4 gets item 6, with a valuation of 72.
- Agent 5 gets item 1, with a valuation of 28.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution of high-valued items is balanced to maintain fairness.
