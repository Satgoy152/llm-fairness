Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  38  72   9   0  95  80
1  22  15  84  24  93  53  42
2  49  85  81   4  99  97  41
3   0  59  22  25  44  95  77
4  89  73  69   2  69  49  26
5  70   7  22   0  58  10  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [70  7 22  0 58 10 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents who value them the most. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (95).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (93).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest, but it's already taken. The next highest valued item for agent 2 is item 5, but it's also taken. So, we consider item 2 (81).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, but it's already taken. The next highest valued item for agent 3 is item 6 (77).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (89).
6. Agent 5 values item 0 the highest, but it's already taken. The next highest valued item for agent 5 is item 6, but it's already taken. So, we consider item 2 (22).

Let's adjust the assignments to ensure all items are allocated and no agent receives more than one item initially:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 5.
- Now, the only remaining item is 3, which we can assign to the agent with the lowest current satisfaction (agent 0).

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```
