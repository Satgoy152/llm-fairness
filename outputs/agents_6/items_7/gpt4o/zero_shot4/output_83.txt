Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  61  22  27  20  23  67
1  28  66   9  19  45  36  78
2  84  51   6  95   8  89   6
3  32  91  52  46  81   3  47
4  31  44   9  51  81  61  21
5  23  85  50  45  59  80  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can employ a method that iteratively assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Create a list of all items and their values for each agent.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on the value of each item for each agent.
3. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and every item is allocated.

Following this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest with a value of 95.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest with a value of 91.
- **Agent 5** values item 5 the highest with a value of 80.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest with a value of 78.
- **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest with a value of 71.
- **Agent 4** values item 4 with a high value of 81.
- **Agent 5** values item 2 with a value of 50, which is the highest remaining unallocated item for that agent.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and agents receive items based on their highest valuations.
