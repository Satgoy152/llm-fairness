Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26   8  80  62  84  74   8
1  39  79  67  67   5  32  97
2  74  19  34  21  39  83  90
3  41  32  31  52  17  45  81
4  35  39  38  69   0  31  95
5  28  58  34  23  63  52  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. We will use a greedy strategy to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** The highest value is 74 (Agent 2). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1:** The highest value is 79 (Agent 1). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** The highest value is 80 (Agent 0). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** The highest value is 69 (Agent 4). Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
5. **Item 4:** The highest value is 84 (Agent 0). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5:** The highest value is 83 (Agent 2). Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6:** The highest value is 97 (Agent 1). Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, each agent except Agents 3 and 5 has received at least one item. To ensure fairness, we reallocate as follows:

- Reallocate item 5 from Agent 2 to Agent 5 (Agent 5 values it at 52, which is significant for a fair distribution).
- Reallocate item 3 from Agent 4 to Agent 3 (Agent 3 values it at 52, which is close to the maximum).

Revised allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 6]
- **Agent 2**: Item [0]
- **Agent 3**: Item [3]
- **Agent 4**: No items
- **Agent 5**: Item [5]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item where possible.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```
