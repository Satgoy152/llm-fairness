Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  15  68  85  58  92  53
1  89  77  44  49   7  89  31
2  76  47   3  89  93  19  60
3  23  63  13  81  61  88  23
4   0  36  29  70  58  36  57
5  95  93   0  51  35  24  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 77 44 49  7 89 31]
 [76 47  3 89 93 19 60]

 [ 0 36 29 70 58 36 57]
 [95 93  0 51 35 24 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach: assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This method aims to maximize the total satisfaction based on the given valuations. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Item 0: 
   - Highest value is 95 by Agent 5.

2. Item 1:
   - Highest value is 93 by Agent 5.

3. Item 2:
   - Highest value is 68 by Agent 0.

4. Item 3:
   - Highest value is 89 by Agent 2.

5. Item 4:
   - Highest value is 93 by Agent 2.

6. Item 5:
   - Highest value is 92 by Agent 0.

7. Item 6:
   - Highest value is 81 by Agent 5.

Now, let's format this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

The allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are allocated.
