Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  82  89  87  23  85  25
1  81   9  32  71  66  75  80
2  39  71  92  10  85  72  58
3  49  62  24   3  83  23   0
4  22  17  28   1  32  72  46
5  70  84  57  75  24  83  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are assigned. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest-valued item for each agent and allocate it to them.
2. Make sure each item is only allocated once, and each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure all items are allocated and each agent is fairly treated.

Based on the valuations given, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [6]
- Agent 2: Items [2]
- Agent 3: Items [4]
- Agent 4: Items [5]
- Agent 5: Items [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a beneficial item based on their valuations while distributing all items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```
