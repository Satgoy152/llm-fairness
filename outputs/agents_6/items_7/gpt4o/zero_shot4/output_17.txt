Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  16  24   8  99  60  26
1  77  31   1  93  90  14  35
2  89  50  77  31  72  23  95
3  18  55  57  15  43  47  90
4  21  14  16  75  16  18  10
5  74  31  11  19  43  16  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations each agent has for different items and try to allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (99), Item 0 (80), Item 5 (60)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 4 (90), Item 0 (77)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (95), Item 0 (89), Item 2 (77)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (90), Item 2 (57), Item 1 (55)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (75), Item 0 (21), Item 2 (16)

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (85), Item 0 (74), Item 1 (31)

To ensure fairness, we can allocate the items by considering these valuations and attempting to give each agent their highest-valued items, avoiding conflicts where possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value among all agents for this item)
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 3 (good value and no major conflicts)
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value among all agents for this item)
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value among all agents for this item)
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value among all agents for this item)
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 5 (Agent 0 already has two items, and Agent 5 has good valuation)
- **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value among all agents for this item)

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. Agent 4 does not receive any items as their valuations are generally lower compared to other agents' highest valuations for the items.
