Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95   7  54  67  93  33  82
1   5  65  38  93  87  68  29
2  43  28  91  15  28  76  11
3  54  59  54  76  64  90  60
4  20   2  71  59  72   6  78
5  49  83  82  78  27  27   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. One possible way to allocate the items is by considering each agent's highest valuations and ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (95).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (93).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (91).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (90).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (78).
- Agent 5 values item 1 the highest (83).

We can allocate the remaining item 4 to Agent 0, as they have the second-highest valuation for it (93).

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```
