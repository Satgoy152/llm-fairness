Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  53  98  27  75  78  61
1  37   7  21  13  93  27  50
2  80   9  79  50  51  80  54
3  32  17  17  17  47  88  53
4  86  79  88   2  18  22  62
5  24  86  69  78  78  91   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm or other methods to ensure fairness based on the given valuations. An ideal approach is to assign items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's perform the allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value for each item.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. If two agents have the same valuation for an item, assign it to the agent with fewer items.

Following this approach, we get:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 4 (value 86)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 5 (value 86)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (value 98)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 5 (value 78)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 1 (value 93)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 5 (value 91)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (value 61)

Now, let's ensure each agent has an item. If any agent is left without an item, we need to adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: No items, needs adjustment
- Agent 3: No items, needs adjustment
- Agent 4: Item [0]
- Agent 5: Items [1, 3, 5]

To adjust, we can reallocate one of Agent 5's items to Agent 2 and Agent 3. Let's reallocate:

- Move item 3 from Agent 5 to Agent 2
- Move item 1 from Agent 5 to Agent 3

Now, the allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: Item [0]
- Agent 5: Item [5]

This results in each agent having at least one item, and all items being allocated. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
