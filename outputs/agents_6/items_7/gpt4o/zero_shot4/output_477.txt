Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94   3  58  82   7  77  92
1  93  64  56  23  71  15  41
2  50  89  70  86  21  17  65
3  13  15  69  29  32  72  72
4  53   5  52  70  19  85  76
5  50  27   0  30  44  75  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are distributed.

One approach is to assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the highest (94).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the highest (89).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the second highest (58).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the highest (86).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it the highest (71).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 4 because agent 4 values it the highest (85).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the highest (92).

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while prioritizing their highest valuations.
