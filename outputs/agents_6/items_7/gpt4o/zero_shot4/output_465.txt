Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  54  37  57  26  29  38
1  33  26  88  42  76  90  77
2   5  21   1   2  76  67  54
3  91  49  17  86   3  75  66
4  62  62  19  18  82  90  88
5   2  96  10  59  59  36  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and each item must be allocated to one agent. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one of the agents will end up with 2 items. We will aim to maximize the satisfaction or valuation of the items each agent receives.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent places on an item and allocate that item to the agent if it's still available.
2. If an agent has already received an item, move to the next highest value for another agent.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.

Based on the given valuations:
- Agent 0: Valuations: [0, 54, 37, 57, 26, 29, 38]
- Agent 1: Valuations: [33, 26, 88, 42, 76, 90, 77]
- Agent 2: Valuations: [5, 21, 1, 2, 76, 67, 54]
- Agent 3: Valuations: [91, 49, 17, 86, 3, 75, 66]
- Agent 4: Valuations: [62, 62, 19, 18, 82, 90, 88]
- Agent 5: Valuations: [2, 96, 10, 59, 59, 36, 49]

Allocations:
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (91), so allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the most (96), so allocate item 1 to Agent 5.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (88), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (90), so allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (57), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (76), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most after item 2 (77), so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

With this allocation, we ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
