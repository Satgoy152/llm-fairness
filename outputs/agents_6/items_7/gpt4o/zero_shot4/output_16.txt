Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12   3  95  68  38  46  57
1  88  89  23  60  32  18  53
2  96  15  73  36  21  11  23
3  77  34  13  28  42  52  75
4  37  95  12   0  11  63   7
5  37  79  91  85  82  17  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with relatively balanced total valuations. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation of items for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents while trying to equalize the total value of items assigned to each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value in item 2 (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value in item 1 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value in item 0 (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value in item 6 (75).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value in item 5 (63).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value in item 3 (85).

Since only 6 items have been allocated, we need to allocate one more item. The remaining item is item 4. The agent with the lowest total valuation so far is Agent 4. Thus, we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
