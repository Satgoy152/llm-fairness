Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  86   0  72  88  76  76
1  45  37  79   2  31  41  55
2  72  12  62  97  31  43  48
3  98  78  83  91  68   8  69
4  75  79  28  52  80  26  59
5  86  66  55  29  89  92  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll follow a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each item by assigning it to the agent who values it the most. Here is the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 98. Thus, assign Item 0 to Agent 3.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 86. Thus, assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 79. Thus, assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 97. Thus, assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 5 values it the highest at 89. Thus, assign Item 4 to Agent 5.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 5 values it the highest at 92. Thus, assign Item 5 to Agent 5.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 and Agent 3 both value it at 76, the highest value. To balance the allocations, assign Item 6 to Agent 0, who has fewer items than Agent 3.

Now let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
