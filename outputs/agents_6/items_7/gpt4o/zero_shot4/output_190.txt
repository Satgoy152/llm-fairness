Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  25  29  94  47  84  96
1  80   2   4  84  91  98   6
2   5  99  72  72  47  43  60
3  54  86  81  54  81  78  24
4  41  98  68  25  79  89  28
5  83  90  26  28  84  77  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

2. Make sure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

3. Consider the total number of items and distribute them as evenly as possible.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (94), so we assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (98), so we assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (99), so we assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (86), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 4 (81), so we assign item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (98), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5 (89), but it's already taken. We assign item 0 (41) to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most (83), but it's taken. The next highest is item 1 (90), but it's taken. We assign item 6 (61) to agent 5.

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated and to adjust as needed:

- Items allocated: [3, 5, 1, 4, 0, 6]
- Unallocated item: 2

Let's assign the remaining item 2 to the agent who values it most among those who have less than 2 items:

- Agent 5 values item 2 at 26, which is decent. We assign item 2 to agent 5.

Here's the finalized allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.
