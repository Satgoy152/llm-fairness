Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  39  56   1  62  77  98
1   6  26  99  69  18  30  41
2  77  76  93  36  13  21  75
3  21  34  32  87  52  60  56
4  47   8  65  39  64   5  18
5  38  29  14  95  44  20  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, one approach is to use a method that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the valuations given. A common method is to use a "round-robin" or "serial dictatorship" approach where agents take turns selecting their most valued available item until all items are allocated.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 93).
2. Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 98).
3. Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 87).
4. Agent 5 picks item 5 (value 20).
5. Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 26).
6. Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 64).
7. Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 77) since it's their next highest available preference.

This allocation attempts to balance the values each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here is the JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
