Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  75  52  13   6  50  96
1  72  70  33  92  52  49   1
2  84  63  98   2  78  69  69
3   5   9  63   1  20   0   7
4  23  41  15  75  72  50  35
5   9  57   4  55  94   5  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. We will use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Given their highest valuation is for item 6 (value 96), we will allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (value 92), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 98), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Given the values, none of them stand out. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3, considering it's not highly valued by others.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 3, but it's already allocated. Next best choice is item 4 (value 72), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 4 the highest, but it's already allocated. Instead, we allocate item 5 to Agent 5 (value 5).

Now let's check for any remaining unallocated items:

- Items 1 and 3 are not yet allocated. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (as it has the next highest valuation after item 6 for them) and item 3 remains with Agent 1, as originally allocated.

The final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated fairly based on the given valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
