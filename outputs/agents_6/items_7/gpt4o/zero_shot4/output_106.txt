Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  62  26   9   0  40  66
1  35  43  60  76   8  24  15
2  52   4  97   5  94  33  69
3  11   8  24  18  29  21  43
4   2  18  86   1  55  68   5
5   9  94  79  89  70  33  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and the distribution is as equitable as possible. Hereâ€™s one approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Preferences:** Each agent values items differently. We can attempt to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations.

2. **Assign Items:** Allocate the items by iterating over agents and giving them their highest valued available item.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the highest (74).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the highest (76).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the highest (97).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the highest (43).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 the highest (68).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 1 the highest (94).

Now, let's ensure that the allocation adheres to the requirement of distributing exactly 7 items:

- Items assigned: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.
- Remaining item: 4.

To allocate item 4, we can assign it to the agent who would benefit from it the most without already having a high valued item:

- **Agent 1**: Already has item 3.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 4 (55) and would benefit significantly.

Now, all 7 items are distributed fairly among the agents.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
