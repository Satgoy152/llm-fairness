Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  75  56  18  60  11  63
1   8  71  46  74  71  70  52
2  39  96  68  20  40  62  92
3  57  18  10  94  30  16   0
4  79  31  39  94  40  43  50
5  16  27  14  39  98  53  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. We'll try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's evaluate the agents' preferences and allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 highly (75).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 highly (74).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 highly (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly (94).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 highly (79).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 4 highly (98).

Considering the above preferences and aiming to allocate all items:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 5 (highest valuation for an item).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent's preferences are considered, and all items are allocated fairly among the agents.
