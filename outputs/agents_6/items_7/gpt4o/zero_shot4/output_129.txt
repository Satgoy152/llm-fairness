Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  94  36  95  21  53  19
1  93  90  40  79  93  87  57
2  52  99   4   0  88  57  29
3  93  95   6  78  37  32   6
4  24  72  79  34  91  33  47
5   5  19  36  62  53  10  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that all items are distributed and each agent can receive zero or more items. We'll try to maximize the total value that each agent receives.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's look at the valuations and assign the items accordingly:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 93, the highest.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 99, the highest.
- **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it at 79, the highest.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 95, the highest.
- **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it at 91, the highest.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 87, the highest.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 57, the highest.

With this allocation, we ensure that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items to agents based on their highest valuations for each item, ensuring a fair distribution.
