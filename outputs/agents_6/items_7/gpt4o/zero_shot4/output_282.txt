Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  29  55  64  39   7  33
1  61  20  86  13  35  33  38
2  12  33  31  81  71  80  54
3  62  60  54  86  30  94  94
4  74  54  36  91  36  77  34
5   7  54  19  60  93  15  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute them such that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Given the valuations provided, we can attempt to assign items while considering both fairness and the integer constraint for the number of items each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: The agent has high valuations for item 3 (64) and item 2 (55). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1: The agent has the highest valuation for item 2 (86). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2: The highest valuation is for item 5 (80). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3: This agent has high valuations for both items 3 and 6 (94 each). Since item 3 is already allocated, assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4: The highest valuation is for item 3 (91), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 0 (74). Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5: The highest valuation is for item 4 (93). Assign item 4 to Agent 5.
7. Since there are 7 items, and we've already allocated 6, the remaining item (item 1) should be assigned to the agent with the next highest valuation for any remaining item. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as it also has a decent value for item 1 (29) compared to other agents.

Given these considerations, the allocation could look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
