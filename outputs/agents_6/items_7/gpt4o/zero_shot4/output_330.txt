Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  25   7  46  28  36  18
1  17  31  97  50  68  56  39
2  29  87  38  78  21  81  13
3   2  41  68  42  63  93  23
4  28  98  59  14  87  20  12
5  35  44  89  26  79  96  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure each agent gets one or more items while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. Given the constraint that all items must be allocated, here's one way to distribute them fairly:

1. Start by sorting the items for each agent based on their valuations.
2. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure that all items are distributed and each agent has at least one item if possible.

Following this process, we can arrive at a solution:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```

Here, each agent has been given at least one item, and all items are allocated. This distribution attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their provided valuations.
