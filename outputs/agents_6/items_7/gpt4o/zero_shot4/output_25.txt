Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  17  99  36  31  86  64
1  78  11  58  97  99   9   8
2  52  89  64  99  20  32  31
3  37  88  85  25  75  81  81
4  83  55  65  70  99  54  46
5  25  86  62  38  10   7  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a simple approach by considering the highest valuation for each item and assigning that item to the corresponding agent. This method ensures that every agent gets at least one item and maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (78). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (89). Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (99). Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 and Agent 1 (99). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has fewer items).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (99). Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (86). Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (64). Assign Item 6 to Agent 0.

Now, let's see the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are assigned, and no agent receives a fractional item.
