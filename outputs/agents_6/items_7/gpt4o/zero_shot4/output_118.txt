Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  85  22  97  87  53  52
1  81  84   3  39   3  68  95
2   7  98  82  79  93  96   5
3   1  34  18  12  10   9  64
4  44  20  28  84  96  11  90
5  54  17  97  36  17  35  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 17 97 36 17 35 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (where possible) and exactly seven items are allocated in total. Hereâ€™s one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Assign item 3 (value 97) and item 0 (value 15).
2. **Agent 1:** Assign item 6 (value 95).
3. **Agent 2:** Assign item 5 (value 96).
4. **Agent 3:** Assign item 1 (value 34).
5. **Agent 4:** Assign item 4 (value 96).
6. **Agent 5:** Assign item 2 (value 97).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all items are fairly distributed based on the valuations provided.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
