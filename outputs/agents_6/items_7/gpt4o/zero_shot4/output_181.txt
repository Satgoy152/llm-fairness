Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  54  90  65  28  38  79
1  91  82  21  92  23  83   4
2  97  97  66  63  83  55  90
3  20  58  58  54  88  26  65
4  11  73  53  27  39  61  57
5  57  45  79  79  77  85  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction (or valuation) of the agents. One way to approach this problem is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Item 0: Value is 94 (highest among agents for item 0)
   - Item 2: Value is 90 (highest among agents for item 2)

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Item 3: Value is 92 (highest among agents for item 3)

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Item 1: Value is 97 (highest among agents for item 1)
   - Item 6: Value is 90 (highest among agents for item 6)

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Item 4: Value is 88 (highest among agents for item 4)

5. **Agent 5**:  
   - Item 5: Value is 85 (highest among agents for item 5)

6. **Agent 4**:  
   - No item is assigned because all items have been allocated.

The allocation ensures that each item is only assigned once and maximizes the valuations. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```
