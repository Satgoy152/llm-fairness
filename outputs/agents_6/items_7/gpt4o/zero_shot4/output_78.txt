Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  83  41  83   2  73  77
1  65  59  46  65  69  76  74
2  89   5  50   0   7  18  13
3  59  16  47  95  23  25  17
4  87  96  40  74  92   4  18
5  11  12  16  97  83  35  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple method of assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach ensures that each item is allocated to an agent who values it highly, which is a straightforward way to achieve fairness based on individual valuations.

Let's go through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 2 values it the most with 89.
- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 4 values it the most with 96.
- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it the most with 41.
- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 5 values it the most with 97.
- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 4 values it the most with 92.
- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 1 values it the most with 76.
- **Item 6**: 
  - Agent 5 values it the most with 88.

Now, let's put these allocations into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all 7 items are allocated. Agent 3 receives no items since they did not have the highest valuation for any item.
