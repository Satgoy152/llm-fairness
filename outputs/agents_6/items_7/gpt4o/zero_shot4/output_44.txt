Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  21  45  26  81   4  55
1  42  73  35  55  39  54  89
2  85  56  88  50  34  52   5
3  70  13  61  63  42   4  12
4  79  30   2  84  80  60  41
5  73  72  97  37  79  35  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items so that each agent's total valuation is as equal as possible. Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 4 (81) and 6 (55).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 6 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 2 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 0 (70).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 3 (84).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation for item 2 (97).

Let's attempt to allocate based on these insights while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no item is allocated to more than one agent.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 5

This leaves item 1 unallocated. We can assign it to any agent with a relatively low total valuation to balance the distribution. Let's assign it to Agent 3:

- Agent 3: Items 0, 1

Now let's present this allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```
