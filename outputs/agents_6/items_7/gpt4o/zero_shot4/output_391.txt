Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  75  65  56   6  41  36
1   9  35   2  87  53  87  28
2  91  99   9  17  57  77  83
3  23  98  39  50  69  99  62
4  69  29   9  33  57   1  47
5  43  36  13  27   0  45  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 35  2 87 53 87 28]
 [91 99  9 17 57 77 83]
 [23 98 39 50 69 99 62]
 [69 29  9 33 57  1 47]
 [43 36 13 27  0 45 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations and ensure each agent gets an item or items in a way that attempts to maximize their satisfaction. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 2 since it has the highest value for them at 99.
2. Assign item 5 to agent 3 since it has the highest value for them at 99.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2 since it has the second-highest value for them at 91.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 since it has the highest value for them at 87.
5. Assign item 6 to agent 5 since it has the highest value for them at 89.
6. Assign item 4 to agent 3 since it has the second-highest value for them at 69.
7. Assign item 2 to agent 0 since it has the highest remaining value for them at 65.

With these choices, we have tried to fairly allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [6]
}
```
