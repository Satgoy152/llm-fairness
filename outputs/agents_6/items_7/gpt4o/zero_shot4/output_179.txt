Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  39  10  12  58  28  22
1  40  35  71  61  27  38   6
2  58  54  93  37  53  38  70
3  77  21  15  88  54  16  81
4  20  78  40  80  87  26  34
5  43   0  60   1  43  13  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. A fair allocation strategy tries to consider the agents' preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, given there are 7 items and 6 agents.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (72).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (71).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest, but it's already taken, so we allocate the next highest unallocated item, which is item 6 (70).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (88).
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (87).
6. Agent 5 values item 6 the highest, but it's already taken, so we allocate the next highest unallocated item, which is item 2 (60), but it's also taken, so we allocate item 5 (13).

After allocating one item to each agent, we have assigned 6 items. We have one item left to allocate. We will give this item to the agent who can gain the highest additional satisfaction from it:

- Item 1 is left. The agents who do not have this item and their valuation for item 1 are:  
  - Agent 1: 35
  - Agent 2: 54
  - Agent 4: 78

Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 1 among those without it. Thus, we allocate item 1 to agent 4.

The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 1],
    "5": [5]
}
```
