Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  88  83  47  21  88  45
1  74  46  25  15  76  99  81
2  68  28  23  81  47  89  30
3  39  85  69  88  73  86  38
4   9  73  15  73  75  49  41
5  84   0  32  57  68   9  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and ensure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent while aiming for a distribution that maximizes the overall satisfaction. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5. We can assign them item 0, as it has the highest valuation.
   
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** has a significant interest in item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 3 and 5, but since item 3 is already assigned to Agent 2, we can assign item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4** can be assigned item 4, which they value reasonably compared to others.

6. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 5.

7. **Item 2** remains unallocated. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, who also values it significantly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items assigned is exactly 7.
