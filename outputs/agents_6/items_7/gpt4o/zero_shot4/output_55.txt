Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  23  57  48  95  28  40
1  51  90  61  77  89  84  92
2  25  40  54  60  47  17  27
3  56  78  97  20  17  44  76
4  73  84   4  82  51  62  87
5  76  18  32  54  13  65  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Best items: 4 (95), 2 (57)
   - Allocation: [4, 2]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Best items: 1 (90), 6 (92)
   - Allocation: [1, 6]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Best items: 3 (60)
   - Allocation: [3]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Best items: 5 (44)
   - Allocation: [5]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Best items: 0 (73)
   - Allocation: [0]

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Best items: No items left to allocate.
   - Allocation: []

The allocation of items to agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are distributed.
