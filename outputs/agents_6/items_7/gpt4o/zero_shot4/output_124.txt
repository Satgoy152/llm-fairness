Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  89  37  10  89  41  75
1  60  39  74  95  63  23  73
2  32  85  88  76  27  57  95
3  46  66  18  93  28  28  85
4  73  19  73   7   4  55  13
5  24  57  20   5  85  68  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given there are 6 agents and 7 items, some agents may get more than one item.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring each item is only allocated once.
2. Allocate the remaining items to agents who value them highly but didn't get their top choice if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (value 89).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (value 95).
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the most (value 95).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most (value 93), but it's already allocated. The next best is item 6 (value 85), but it's allocated. Then, item 1 (value 66) which is allocated, so item 0 (value 46).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the most (value 73), but it's allocated. Next is item 2 (value 73).
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the most (value 85).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 5 is still available:
  - Agent 0 has item 1 but can take item 5 (value 41).
  - Agent 2 has item 6 but can take item 5 (value 57).

Reallocate based on next highest value for remaining item:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, who values it at 57 (after considering previous allocations).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```

Each agent gets at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated.
