Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  45  55  63  42  65  85
1  80  12  78  42  37  83  38
2   0  36  23  31  45  91  20
3  19  88  22  21  85  53  40
4  40  53  31  32  88  98  72
5  13  12  17  15  40   5   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness. We'll use a greedy approach to allocate items based on the highest value an agent assigns to an item, ensuring each item is assigned only once and that the allocations are somewhat balanced.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (80).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (88).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (78).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (63).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 4 (88).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by Agent 2 (91).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (85).

Now, let's translate this allocation into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to only one agent, and all 7 items are allocated.
