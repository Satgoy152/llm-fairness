Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  53   3  52  49  53  39
1  25  29  29  59  77  44  34
2  50  49  32  23  28  26  33
3   7   4  41  66  29  36  24
4  28  14   8  51  80  19  60
5  58  12  77  81  20  48  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. We will attempt to give each agent the items that they value the most, keeping in mind that all items need to be allocated and each agent should have an integer number of items.

One way to approach this is to start by allocating the items to the agent who values them the most, and then adjust if needed to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 5 values it the most at 58.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 53.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 5 values it the most at 77.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 5 values it the most at 81.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most at 80.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 53.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most at 60.

We now have:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 4, 6
- Agent 5: Items 0, 2, 3

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This ensures that each agent gets a fair allocation of the items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.
