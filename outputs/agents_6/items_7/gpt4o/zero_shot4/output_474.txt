Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  83   4  43   2  17  73
1  46  95  65  68  41  42  42
2  66  62  89  63  60  98  66
3  36  24  55  76   4  97  33
4  42  20  58  66  95  55  69
5  10  78  53  41  58  45  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent is considered, while all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value for each item across all agents and allocate the item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated to reach exactly 7 items in total and that the distribution is fair.

Let's allocate based on the given values:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 66.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 95.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 89.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 76.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 95.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 97.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most at 70.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
