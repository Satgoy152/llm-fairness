Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  85  92  39  42  76  14
1  22   7  80  33  16  78  80
2  92   3  75  12  87  40  42
3  73  99  24  48  69  77  84
4  76  85  98   2  11  23  33
5  53  72  65  76  37  26  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 7 items are allocated.

We need to balance fairness and total valuation. One way to do this is to allow each agent to receive the item they value the most, as long as it doesn't result in an uneven allocation.

By evaluating the table, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value of 92).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (value of 80).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value of 92).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value of 99).
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most but it's already taken, so they get item 1 (value of 85).
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the most (value of 76).

Now we have:
- Agent 0: item 2
- Agent 1: item 6
- Agent 2: item 0
- Agent 3: item 1
- Agent 4: item 4 (after agent 0 and 3 have higher preferences)
- Agent 5: item 3

Finally, item 5 is not yet allocated and has a similar value for multiple agents, but since agent 1 has a relatively lower total value, it can be allocated to agent 1 to maintain fairness.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and that the distribution is fair based on the perceived value from each agent's perspective.
