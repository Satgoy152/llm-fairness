Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  94  19  21  83   1  56
1  31  66  76  27  47  81  35
2  26  61  90  40  24  47  75
3  88  46   1  35  31  51  54
4  71  48   1   8  72  41  34
5  74  23  54  49   3  54  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the "maximin" strategy, where we try to maximize the minimum value each agent receives. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, at least one agent will receive two items. I will proceed with the allocation by ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that the distribution is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

Here's an allocation that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Agent 0 receives items 0 and 6.
2. Agent 1 receives item 5.
3. Agent 2 receives item 2.
4. Agent 3 receives item 3.
5. Agent 4 receives item 4.
6. Agent 5 receives item 1.

This allocation is based on ensuring each agent gets at least one high-value item according to their preferences, while considering the constraint of distributing all items.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
