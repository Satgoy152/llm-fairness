Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24   7  44  52  71  20   2
1   7  59  67  57  38   9  81
2  12  16  56  73  97  28  72
3  43  61  58  50  67  28   2
4  39  75  86  58   1  95  23
5   8  41  77   1  51  55   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize individual satisfaction based on each agent's valuation. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's an allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest value by agent 4 (39).
2. Item 1: Highest value by agent 4 (75).
3. Item 2: Highest value by agent 4 (86).
4. Item 3: Highest value by agent 2 (73).
5. Item 4: Highest value by agent 2 (97).
6. Item 5: Highest value by agent 4 (95).
7. Item 6: Highest value by agent 1 (81).

However, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share, considering that some agents might not receive any items if we only follow the strict highest value rule. Thus, let's adjust to ensure a more balanced allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 5.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 4.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item, and we respect the valuation to a reasonable extent.
