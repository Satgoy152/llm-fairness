Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  13  25  96  12  52   4
1  22  31  20  62  58  89  23
2  44  21  12  58   3  37  74
3  29  26  11  10  92  46  78
4  55  84  86   9  32  23  49
5  84  38  70  89  45  56  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item and determine which agent values it the most, then assign the item to that agent. Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Agent 0: 77  
   - Agent 1: 22  
   - Agent 2: 44  
   - Agent 3: 29  
   - Agent 4: 55  
   - Agent 5: 84  
   - **Allocate to Agent 5** (highest value)

2. **Item 1:**  
   - Agent 0: 13  
   - Agent 1: 31  
   - Agent 2: 21  
   - Agent 3: 26  
   - Agent 4: 84  
   - Agent 5: 38  
   - **Allocate to Agent 4** (highest value)

3. **Item 2:**  
   - Agent 0: 25  
   - Agent 1: 20  
   - Agent 2: 12  
   - Agent 3: 11  
   - Agent 4: 86  
   - Agent 5: 70  
   - **Allocate to Agent 4** (highest value)

4. **Item 3:**  
   - Agent 0: 96  
   - Agent 1: 62  
   - Agent 2: 58  
   - Agent 3: 10  
   - Agent 4: 9  
   - Agent 5: 89  
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest value)

5. **Item 4:**  
   - Agent 0: 12  
   - Agent 1: 58  
   - Agent 2: 3  
   - Agent 3: 92  
   - Agent 4: 32  
   - Agent 5: 45  
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value)

6. **Item 5:**  
   - Agent 0: 52  
   - Agent 1: 89  
   - Agent 2: 37  
   - Agent 3: 46  
   - Agent 4: 23  
   - Agent 5: 56  
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (highest value)

7. **Item 6:**  
   - Agent 0: 4  
   - Agent 1: 23  
   - Agent 2: 74  
   - Agent 3: 78  
   - Agent 4: 49  
   - Agent 5: 21  
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (highest value)

Based on the above allocations, the JSON representation of the allocations is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [0]
}
```

All items have been allocated, and each agent has an integer number of items.
