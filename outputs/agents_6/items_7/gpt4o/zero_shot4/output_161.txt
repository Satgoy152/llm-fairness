Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  94  35  79  62  37  78
1  32  99  32   8  57  86  72
2  41  91  82  67  52  46  92
3  14  74  31  72  62  52  59
4  59  71  61  22  44   3  40
5  77  47  38  87  32  48  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.

Here's one possible fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 94, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 86, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the highest at 92, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 72, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest at 59, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest at 87, but it is already allocated, so we allocate item 4 (next highest value at 32) to Agent 5.
7. The remaining unallocated items are 2 and 4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly, but since it is already allocated, we allocate item 2 to Agent 4 (next highest value at 61).

This allocation ensures every agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation optimizes the total valuation for each agent while fairly distributing the items.
