Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  79  51  47  97  43  43
1  51  76  61  44  27  90  78
2   3  37  77  30   6  32  72
3  75  90  53  66  54  46  27
4  30   2  90  32  92  59  81
5  31  20  19  17   8  40  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Given the data, we have:

- 6 agents (0 to 5)
- 7 items (0 to 6)

A fair allocation can be approached by attempting to give each agent at least one high-value item, ensuring no agent is left entirely without consideration. Below is one possible allocation that respects these constraints:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations [8, 79, 51, 47, 97, 43, 43]  
   - High-value items: 4 (97), 1 (79)
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations [51, 76, 61, 44, 27, 90, 78]  
   - High-value items: 5 (90), 1 (76)
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations [3, 37, 77, 30, 6, 32, 72]  
   - High-value item: 2 (77)
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations [75, 90, 53, 66, 54, 46, 27]  
   - High-value items: 1 (90), 3 (66)
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations [30, 2, 90, 32, 92, 59, 81]  
   - High-value items: 4 (92), 2 (90)
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 4 (second-highest for this agent).

6. **Agent 5**: Valuations [31, 20, 19, 17, 8, 40, 46]  
   - High-value items are comparatively lower, item 0 is a moderate choice.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 5.

We have now allocated 6 items, and there is 1 item left (item 3) that needs to be allocated:

- Remaining item 3 can be allocated to agent 3 as they have a relatively high valuation for it (66).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of high-value items among agents while ensuring every item is allocated.
