Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  53   0  97  77  71   8
1  91  61  92  64  87  77   1
2   0  33  37  24  72  90  36
3  59  11  36  98  95  77  62
4  75  61  22  81   7  16  48
5  55  14  82  90  25  44   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes fairness. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and that no items are left unallocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by agent 1 (91).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by agent 0 (53).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by agent 5 (82).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by agent 3 (98).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by agent 3 (95).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by agent 2 (90).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is by agent 3 (62).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0 can get item 1.
- Agent 1 can get item 0.
- Agent 2 can get item 5.
- Agent 3 can get items 3 and 6.
- Agent 4 should get an item, so let's reassign item 4 to agent 4 (even though agent 3 values it more, agent 3 already has two items).
- Agent 5 can get item 2.

Here's how the allocation looks:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
