Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15   8  25  92  77  19  46
1  78  18  77  43  67  12  70
2  39  66  63  17  35  45   5
3  78  65  39  43  33  84   8
4  50  97  52  89  76  13  60
5  54  56  62  66  90  25  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items based on their valuations, striving to maximize total satisfaction. One common approach is to use a method that aims to allocate items to the agents that value them the most while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate which agent values each item the most.
2. Allocate the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item by reassigning items if necessary.

Given the table, let's find which agent values each item the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (value = 78)
- Item 1: Agent 4 (value = 97)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (value = 25)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (value = 92)
- Item 4: Agent 5 (value = 90)
- Item 5: Agent 3 (value = 84)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (value = 70)

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 2, Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 6
- Agent 2: (no items initially)
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 4

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item. Agent 2 has no items, so we need to reallocate:

Since Agent 0 has two items and Agent 2 has none, we can reassign one item from Agent 0 to Agent 2. Reassign Item 2 (value 63 for Agent 2) from Agent 0 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, with a total of 7 items allocated. Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```
