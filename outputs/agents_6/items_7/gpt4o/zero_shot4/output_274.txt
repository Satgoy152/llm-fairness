Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  61  56  46  23  31  67
1  35  15   1  99  75  16  25
2  42  18  17  12  76  87  66
3  44  29  79  69  96  41  48
4   4  59  52  23  77  74  75
5  96  68  71  61  15  14  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation of the items given to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no more than the number they can handle (in this case, one). We can apply a balanced approach to distribute the items based on the highest valuations by each agent for each item, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Hereâ€™s one way to perform this allocation:

1. Identify which agent values each item the most.
2. Assign the items to these agents, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. If there is a tie in valuation, assign the item to any of the highest valuing agents at random or based on other criteria such as minimizing the total number of items per agent.

Following these guidelines, we get the following allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 5 (value 96).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 61).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 79).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 99).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 96).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 87).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 67).

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items to the agents while considering the highest valuations for each item.
