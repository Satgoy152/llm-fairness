Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  30  68  69  73  88  35
1  38  31  41  43  27  54  78
2   6  39  58   3  86  52  69
3   2   7  37  95  40   2  49
4  71  38  28  19  21  33  37
5  48  41  77  34  58  14  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider both the valuations and the need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations to ensure a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 5 (value 88). Allocating item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 6 (value 78). Allocating item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 86). Allocating item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 3 (value 95). Allocating item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 0 (value 71). Allocating item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for Agent 5 is item 2 (value 77). Allocating item 2 to Agent 5.

Now, one item remains unallocated, which is item 1. We need to allocate this to one of the agents based on who values it most among those who received one item. 

- Agent 5 has the second-highest valuation for item 1 (value 41).

Thus, item 1 will be allocated to Agent 5.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 1]
}
```
