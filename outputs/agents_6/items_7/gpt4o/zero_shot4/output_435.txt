Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  55  60  37  37  91  37
1  72  96  19  76  33  13  85
2  89  15  65  97  47  56  23
3  31  86   4  37  51  50  72
4  62  38  70  41  17  94  14
5  27  56  69  26  67  24  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items to the 6 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent's preferences are fairly respected while ensuring all items are allocated uniquely.

One approach is to use the "maximum valuation" strategy, where each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with a reasonable distribution of items. Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest (97).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest (96).
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the highest (70).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest (97).
- Item 4: Agent 5 values it the highest (67).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest (91).
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the highest (83).

Now, let's ensure that each agent is fairly considered and adjust if necessary to ensure no agent is left without items.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 5]
- Agent 1 gets item [1]
- Agent 2 gets item [3]
- Agent 3 gets no items []
- Agent 4 gets item [2]
- Agent 5 gets items [4, 6]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```
