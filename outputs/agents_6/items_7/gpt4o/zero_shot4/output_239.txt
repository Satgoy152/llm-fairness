Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  95  70  13  52  98  15
1  12  34  85  20  30  81  79
2  18  39  94  66  22  34  79
3  38  91  62  10  89  86  92
4  90  20  90  11  73  40  40
5  46  57  13  82   3  66  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. This can often be achieved by using a method similar to a "greedy algorithm" where we allocate items based on the highest value-to-agent ratio, ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 95, from both Agent 0 and Agent 4. Let's allocate it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Again, the highest valuation is 95 by Agent 0. Allocate it to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 94 by Agent 2. Allocate it to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 82 by Agent 5. Allocate it to Agent 5.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 89 by Agent 3. Allocate it to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 98 by Agent 0. Allocate it to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is 92 by Agent 3. Allocate it to Agent 3.

This allocation is done to maximize the individual satisfaction of agents based on their highest valuation of the items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
