Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  80  12  23  38  84   8
1  26  94  12  55  69  81  65
2  15  52  20  37  98  76  83
3  84  90  41  51   6  41  25
4  27  62  72  65  15  24  25
5  18  76   4  78  47  22  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items while all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values items 4 and 6.
- Agent 3 highly values item 0.
- Agent 4 highly values item 2.
- Agent 5 highly values item 3.

Following these observations, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 4 and 6
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 3

This allocation gives each agent at least one item except for one agent, ensuring that all 7 items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
