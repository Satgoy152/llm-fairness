Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  31  67  52  16  74  61
1  35  70  91   5  81  39  54
2   1  25  29  22   9  75  52
3  62  50  94  79  14  79  24
4  35  75  90  42  75  83  72
5   3  95  46  39  45  64  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 70 91  5 81 39 54]
 [ 1 25 29 22  9 75 52]
 [62 50 94 79 14 79 24]
 [35 75 90 42 75 83 72]
 [ 3 95 46 39 45 64 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 6 agents and 7 items, so one possible fair allocation is to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and one agent gets two items.

After analyzing the table for valuations, here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2.
- Agent 2 highly values item 5, but since it's taken, item 6 is the next highest.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2, but since it's taken, item 3 is the next highest.
- Agent 4 highly values item 2, but since it's taken, item 1 is the next highest.
- Agent 5 highly values item 1 and item 2, but since they are taken, item 0 is the next highest.

Assigning items:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.
- Agent 5 gets item 0.
- The remaining item, 4, can be assigned to Agent 4 as they have a reasonably high valuation for it.

Here is the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
