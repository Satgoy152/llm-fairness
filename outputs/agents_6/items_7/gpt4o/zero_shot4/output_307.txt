Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  52  46  42  26  87  61
1  30  97  85  23  35  78  57
2  88  76  57  72   1  17  49
3  57  81  66  73  74  74  44
4  52  16  84  84  97  38  74
5  10  77  84  44  22  81  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy method where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 2 (88).
   - Allocate to agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 1 (97).
   - Allocate to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 1 (85).
   - Allocate to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 3 (73).
   - Allocate to agent 3.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 4 (97).
   - Allocate to agent 4.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 0 (87).
   - Allocate to agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 0 (61).
   - Allocate to agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, maximizing total satisfaction. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": []
}
```
