Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1   7  47  13  76  91  29
1  90  60   0   5  22  35  46
2  72  86  41  61  66  36  82
3  68  54  63  43  61  75  54
4  63  66  79  89  45  86  99
5  44  73  81  35  70  48  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on the given valuations. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 5 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 0 (value 90).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 6 (value 82).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 2 (value 63).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 3 (value 89).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for agent 5 is item 4 (value 70).

Now, we check if any item is still left unallocated. The items from 0 to 4 are already allocated, and item 5 and item 6 are allocated as well. However, item 1 is still unallocated. 

To handle this, we can assign the next highest unallocated item to each agent based on their second highest preference if there's a tie, or based on the next best available choice.

We will assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is Agent 2's second highest unallocated preference.

Thus, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated exactly once, and agents receive items based on their highest valuation preferences.
