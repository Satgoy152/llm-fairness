Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  79  34  20  73  62  80
1  55  80   9  80  38  94  78
2  42  83   8  62  32  30   7
3  88  31   3  31  94  30  62
4  57  66  92  78  14  15  71
5  21  48  63  95  37  30   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated in total. Here is one potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.  
2. Ensure that every agent gets at least one item and that all items are distributed among the agents. 

Based on the given valuations, here is the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 88 (highest)
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 83 (highest)
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it at 92 (highest)
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it at 95 (highest)
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it at 94 (highest)
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 94 (highest)
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 80 (highest)

Now, we check if any agent is left out and adjust the allocation to ensure fairness:

- Agent 3 has items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 has item 1.
- Agent 4 has item 2.
- Agent 5 has item 3.
- Agent 1 has item 5.
- Agent 0 has item 6.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed. The allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
