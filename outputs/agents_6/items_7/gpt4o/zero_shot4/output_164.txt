Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31   0  87  21  45  56  10
1   2  79  46  42  64  35   5
2  95  98  30  10   6  23  40
3  41  68  79  89  14  71  30
4  71  46  84  21  44  79  88
5  85  19  67  69  43  27  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives as fair a share as possible, given the constraint of integer allocations. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while distributing all the items out.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent places on the items and assign them accordingly, ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's break down the allocation based on the values provided in the table:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (87).
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (79).
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly (98) but since it's already allocated, next is item 0 (95).
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly (89).
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly (88).
- Agent 5 values item 0 highly (85), but since it's already allocated, next is item 6 (75), which is also taken, so we go for item 3 (69).

Now, ensure all items are distributed fairly:

- Assign the remaining items, ensuring no agent is left without an item if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items [2]
- Agent 1: Items [1]
- Agent 2: Items [0]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [6]
- Agent 5: Items [4, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and maximizes their respective valuations as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```
