Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  74  12  49  87  48  89
1  56  76  57  46  32  99  83
2  34  95  83  18  12  41  37
3  29  29  65  32  35  42  42
4  27  34  31   9  37   9  43
5  50  90  72  31   3  66  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. One approach is to aim for maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring fairness in distribution.

Let's analyze the valuation table and allocate items in a way that attempts to balance the total valuation received by each agent:

- Agent 0 highly values item 6 (89) and item 4 (87).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for item 5 (99) and item 1 (76).
- Agent 2 values item 1 (95) and item 2 (83) highly.
- Agent 3 does not have particularly high valuations compared to others but is reasonably balanced.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 6 (43).
- Agent 5 values item 1 (90) and item 5 (66).

Considering this information, let's make a reasonable allocation:

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (since Agent 4's next highest valuation is lower than what Agent 0 offers for item 6, and Agent 0's other high-value item, item 4, can be allocated elsewhere).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as it's their highest value.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, since it's their highest value.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 5, as it is one of their higher-value items after item 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3, ensuring they receive an item.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 4, as it gives them a reasonable valuation.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 5, as it's one of their remaining higher-value items.

Now, let's put this allocation into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least a fair valuation based on the values they have for the items.
