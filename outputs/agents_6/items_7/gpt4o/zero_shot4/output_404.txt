Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  54  54  23  55   8  76
1  50  21  15   5   3   7  76
2  18  41   5  13  91   3  78
3   7   3  95  73  70  95   3
4  71  32  31  75  10  78  70
5   5  76  47  21  47  91  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the 7 items to the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing the agents' valuations for the items they receive. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item among all agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. If conflicts arise (i.e., multiple items are best valued by the same agent), distribute items to ensure fairness by considering the next highest valuations or reallocating items.

Let's consider the allocation for each agent:

- Agent 0: Highest value for item 4 (value 55)
- Agent 1: Highest value for item 0 (value 50)
- Agent 2: Highest value for item 4 (value 91), but allocated item 6 (value 78) as item 4 is allocated to Agent 3.
- Agent 3: Highest value for item 2 (value 95)
- Agent 4: Highest value for item 5 (value 78)
- Agent 5: Highest value for item 1 (value 76)

Now, let's finalize the allocations making sure each agent gets at least one item:

1. Agent 0: Item 0
2. Agent 1: Item 1
3. Agent 2: Item 6
4. Agent 3: Item 2
5. Agent 4: Item 4
6. Agent 5: Item 5
7. Remaining item 3 is allocated to agent 4 as it maximizes their value and ensures fairness.

Finally, here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
