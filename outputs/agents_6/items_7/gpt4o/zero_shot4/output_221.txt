Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  61  60   4  99   6  87
1  31  36  11  68  28  35   3
2  43  36  48  60  13  11  91
3  53  98  94  56  94   5  11
4  44  64  62  57  79  43  79
5  11  57  10  94  38   5  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) among all agents, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and each item is assigned to one agent. Below is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the most.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the most.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 the most.

We also need to allocate the remaining items. In this case, item 0 is left:

7. Agent 2 values item 0 highly after item 6, so we can assign item 0 to agent 2.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
