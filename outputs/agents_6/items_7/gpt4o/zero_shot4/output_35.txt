Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  57  90  70  77  98  22
1  98  68  77  35  53  12   7
2   5  95   9  86  43  19  96
3  11  46  26  23  30   6  15
4  13  83  97  42  83  44  67
5  48  35  59  86  48   1  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents where they have higher valuations. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 5, as agent 0 has the highest valuation for this item (98).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 0, as agent 1 values it highly (98).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 6, as agent 2 has the highest valuation for this item (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3, as agent 3 values it highest among their options (23).
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 2, as agent 4 values it highly (97).
6. **Agent 5**: Assign items 1 and 4, as agent 5 values them reasonably, and to ensure all 7 items are distributed (35 and 48, respectively).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and it seeks to optimize satisfaction based on the provided valuations.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```
