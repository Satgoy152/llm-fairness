Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95   3  65  45  66  66  79
1  49  75  89  28  98  35  28
2  22  33  27  67  69  63   2
3  64  37  89  26  73  33  80
4  40  97  26  13  75  51  95
5  48  44  52  18  65  85  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a similar total value from their allocated items. This approach helps ensure fairness in terms of the perceived value by each agent. Let's attempt to allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 95)
2. **Agent 1**: Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value = 98)
3. **Agent 2**: Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (value = 63)
4. **Agent 3**: Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 3 (value = 80)
5. **Agent 4**: Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 4 (value = 97)
6. **Agent 5**: Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 5 (value = 18)
7. **Remaining item**: Item 2 is left and has a high value for Agent 1, which balances Agent 1's total value. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 89).

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```
