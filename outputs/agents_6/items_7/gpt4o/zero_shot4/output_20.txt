Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  99  18  72  68   9  28
1  87  72  15  96  90  13   6
2  42  47  50  53  86  41  29
3  31  81  19   5  48  76  16
4  54  25  87  66  32  42  43
5  60  79   9  69  62  23  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will get 2 items, while the others will get 1 item each. We can use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on their valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the item with the highest value for each agent first, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Assign the remaining item to the agent who values it the most, considering the current allocation.

Let's examine the table and perform the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 99.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 96.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 86.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most at 81.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most at 87.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 the most at 79.

After assigning these items, we have:
- Items assigned: 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1
- Remaining items: 0, 5, 6

Since item 1 was already assigned to multiple agents, we need to adjust the allocation to ensure each item is assigned only once.

Re-evaluation for assignment:
- Agent 0: highest unassigned value is item 0 (53)
- Agent 1: item 3 (96) already assigned, next highest is item 4 (90)
- Agent 2: item 4 already assigned, next highest is item 3 (53)
- Agent 3: item 1 already assigned, next highest is item 5 (76)
- Agent 4: item 2 already assigned, next highest is item 0 (54)
- Agent 5: item 1 already assigned, next highest is item 0 (60)

Allocate remaining items:
1. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (76) as it has the highest value among remaining items.
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (28).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

Note: The allocation ensures that Agent 5 does not receive an item, while other agents receive one or two items, maximizing the total value.
