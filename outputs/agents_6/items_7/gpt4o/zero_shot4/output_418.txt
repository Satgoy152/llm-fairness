Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  88  99  97  35  92  41
1  58  38  95  42  56  33  36
2   2  57  18  74  17  20  84
3  29  17  68   3  94  56  37
4  94  92  18  24  12   2  19
5  44  64  18  89  49  57   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that the total valuation is considered and each agent gets at least one item, we can use a simple heuristic approach. We will attempt to distribute items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (99), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, but it's already allocated. The next highest value is item 0 (58), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (84), so assign item 6 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (94), so assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest, but it's already allocated. The next highest value is item 1 (92), so assign item 1 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest (89), so assign item 3 to agent 5.

Now, each agent has at least one item. We have allocated 6 out of 7 items, so we need to allocate the final item (item 5):

7. Since item 5 is not assigned, we will check which unallocated item has the highest value across all agents. Item 5 has not been allocated yet, so we assign it to the agent that values it the highest. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (92) among the remaining agents, so assign item 5 to agent 0.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated.
