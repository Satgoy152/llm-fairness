Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  60  52  76  74  53  78
1  26  90   2  82   2  28  26
2  32  58  81   7  40  43  41
3  48  86  59   8  71  41   1
4  44  73  99  71  54  12  39
5  75  39  76  79  39  32  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation of items received by each agent is reasonably balanced. One potential approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible. In cases where perfect fairness is not achievable, approximate fairness should be aimed for.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Highest value item is 6 (value 78).
2. Agent 1: Highest value item is 1 (value 90).
3. Agent 2: Highest value item is 2 (value 81).
4. Agent 3: Highest value item is 1 (value 86), but already taken, so next highest is 4 (value 71).
5. Agent 4: Highest value item is 2 (value 99), but already taken, so next highest is 3 (value 71).
6. Agent 5: Highest value item is 0 (value 75).

Now, let's check remaining items: 0, 3, 5. 

7. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value = 53).
8. Assign item 0 to Agent 5 (already has it).
9. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value = 8, highest remaining for Agent 3).

Let's summarize the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to balance the total value assigned to each agent.
