Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  73  64  15  21  81  68
1  15  66  37  99  51  22  26
2  62   9  93  60  82  42  88
3  25  24  61  36  97  94  25
4  74  71   0  21  56  32  16
5  19  45  33  21   7  50  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 73 64 15 21 81 68]
 [15 66 37 99 51 22 26]
 [62  9 93 60 82 42 88]
 [25 24 61 36 97 94 25]
 [74 71  0 21 56 32 16]
 [19 45 33 21  7 50 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a subset of the items that maximizes their valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 0 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 3 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 2 (value 93).
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 5 (value 94).
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 1 (value 71).
6. **Agent 5**: Receives items 4 and 6 (values 7 and 91, respectively).

With this allocation, each agent receives items that provide them with high valuations, and all 7 items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```
