Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  32  63  51  54  65  30
1  82  85  13   8  58  19  55
2  16  85  48  57  29  73  94
3  71  33  30  17  35  88  28
4   1  76  59  50  26  74  31
5  14  50  14  11  44  75  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while also distributing items fairly across all agents.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

Let's analyze the table and allocate:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 82.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 85.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 63.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 51.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 58.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 88.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 94.

Based on this analysis, we can proceed with the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated.
