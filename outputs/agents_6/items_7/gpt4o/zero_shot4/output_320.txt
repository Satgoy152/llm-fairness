Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  33  91  71  59  14  38
1  71  83  39  22  27  48  55
2  54  90  55  44  35  57  65
3  14  67  68  88  76  55  22
4  54  34   3  18  22  62  92
5  48  23  71   5  25   0  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated. 

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:**

   - Item 0: Agent 1 (71)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (90)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (91)
   - Item 3: Agent 3 (88)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (76)
   - Item 5: Agent 4 (62)
   - Item 6: Agent 4 (92)

2. **Allocate items based on these highest valuations:**

   - Assign item 0 to agent 1
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0
   - Assign item 3 to agent 3
   - Assign item 4 to agent 3
   - Assign item 5 to agent 4
   - Assign item 6 to agent 4

3. **Verify that all items are allocated and each agent has an item if possible:**

   - Agent 0 gets item 2
   - Agent 1 gets item 0
   - Agent 2 gets item 1
   - Agent 3 gets items 3 and 4
   - Agent 4 gets items 5 and 6
   - Agent 5 receives no items, as the items are exhausted

Now, let's format the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": []
}
```
This ensures each item is allocated, and the allocation is based on the highest valuations, considering fairness and maximizing the agents' satisfaction.
