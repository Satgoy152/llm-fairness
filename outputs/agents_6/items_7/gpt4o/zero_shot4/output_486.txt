Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  17  27  84  59  25  59
1  55  62  86  43  83  22  49
2  85  47  32  86  82  80  86
3  69   4  11  47  35  36  44
4  38  92  91  35  90  34  41
5  63  30  55  35  99  64  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives approximately equal value, considering their individual valuations. Let's go through a process to determine a reasonable allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (93)
   - Allocated: [0]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (86)
   - Allocated: [2]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (86)
   - Allocated: [6]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (69), but already taken
   - Next highest available valuation: Item 3 (47)
   - Allocated: [3]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (92)
   - Allocated: [1]

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (99)
   - Allocated: [4]

Now, all items except Item 5 have been allocated. We need to assign Item 5 to an agent:

1. **Agent 2** has a reasonably high valuation for Item 5 (80), and since each agent should get at least one item, we can assign Item 5 to Agent 2.

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [5, 6]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all 7 items are distributed. Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```
