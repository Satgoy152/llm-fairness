Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  23  31  55  42  17  65
1  20  65   7  62  45  47   3
2  73  38  35  94  50  37  94
3  14  66  45  11  85  52  70
4  34  50  19   8  16  28  31
5  82  58  61  31  50  29  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their valuations. We have a total of 7 items to allocate to 6 agents, so one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. Here is one way to fairly distribute the items:

- Assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no item is allocated more than once. If there's a tie between agents for the same item, choose the agent that has fewer items assigned.

Using this strategy, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 6 (value 65)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 1 (value 65)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (value 94) and Item 2 (value 35) - As item 3 and 6 both have the highest value for agent 2, we select item 3 and allocate item 2 as an additional item.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4 (value 85)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5 (value 28) - Since all higher-valued items are taken.
6. **Agent 5**: Item 0 (value 82)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```
