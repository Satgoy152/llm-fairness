Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  88  32  51  73  48  88
1  50  53  34  80  49   1  79
2  31  43  70  86  16  88  40
3  80   4  97  22  44  71   3
4  10  27  31  45  96   3  44
5  27  82  46  65  62   8  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. One approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the preferences (valuations) of each agent for the items. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how items can be allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value item 0 (99) and item 1 (88). Allocating item 0 to Agent 0 is beneficial.
2. **Agent 1**: They highly value item 3 (80). Allocating item 3 to Agent 1 is beneficial.
3. **Agent 2**: They highly value item 5 (88). Allocating item 5 to Agent 2 is beneficial.
4. **Agent 3**: They highly value item 2 (97). Allocating item 2 to Agent 3 is beneficial.
5. **Agent 4**: They highly value item 4 (96). Allocating item 4 to Agent 4 is beneficial.
6. **Agent 5**: They highly value item 1 (82). However, item 1 is already taken. They can take item 6, which they value (36).
7. **Unallocated Item**: Check for any remaining items and allocate them fairly. In this case, item 1 remains unallocated from the above selections and has a relatively high value for Agent 0. Therefore, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving a number of items that maximizes their preferences based on the given values.
