Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  16  65  17  89  35  56
1  91  75  14  92  88  19  83
2  26  24  34   6  75  43  18
3   5  58  47  64  53  31  88
4  30  49  66  58  18  60  54
5  46  88  56  29  15  59  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

Here's one way to allocate them considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 4 (Value: 89)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (Value: 92)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 5 (Value: 43)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 6 (Value: 88)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 2 (Value: 66)
6. **Agent 5**: Items 1 and 0 (Values: 88, 46)

This allocation considers the highest value each agent has for different items, giving agent 5 two items since they have relatively high values for multiple items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 0]
}
```
