Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  66   2  18  64  94   7
1  16  88  19  43  89  78  24
2  83  21  36  95  17  18  40
3   8  88   9  14  10  41  15
4   7  43  50  41  73  13  17
5  94  12  79   5  81  54  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while distributing all 7 items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. First, let's identify the highest valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (value 94)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (value 89)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (value 95)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (value 88)
   - Agent 4: Item 4 (value 73) (but already taken by Agent 1, so next best is Item 2 with value 50)
   - Agent 5: Item 0 (value 94)

2. Allocate these high-value items to each agent:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 5
   - Agent 1 gets Item 4
   - Agent 2 gets Item 3
   - Agent 3 gets Item 1
   - Agent 4 gets Item 2
   - Agent 5 gets Item 0

3. Now, distribute the remaining items to ensure all 7 items are allocated. The remaining item is Item 6, which can be allocated to the agent who values it the most among those who have received fewer items:
   - Agent 2 values Item 6 at 40, which is the highest among the agents with available capacity.

Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```
