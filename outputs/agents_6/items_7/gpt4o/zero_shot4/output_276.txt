Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  86  95  55  68  16  35
1   3  15  95   3  46  34  43
2  55  16  10  35  58   6  97
3  64  86  21  46  28  28  31
4  44  38  45  61  42  19  78
5  48  18  84  63  95  19  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items with higher valuations for them (2, 1).
2. **Agent 1**: Receives one item that they value highly (4).
3. **Agent 2**: Receives one item they value highly (6).
4. **Agent 3**: Receives items they value reasonably (0, 3).
5. **Agent 4**: Receives items with moderate values (5).
6. **Agent 5**: Receives one high-value item (4) already allocated, so adjust to distribute fairly if needed.

Allocating based on ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 2]
- **Agent 1**: [4]
- **Agent 2**: [6]
- **Agent 3**: [0]
- **Agent 4**: [5]
- **Agent 5**: [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is spread out based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```
