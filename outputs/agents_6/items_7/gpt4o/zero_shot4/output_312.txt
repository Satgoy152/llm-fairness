Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  65  50  76  21  59  56
1  74  25  99  15  84   3  73
2  67  36   8  27  79  56  20
3  68  95  34   3  50  30  27
4  53  10   9  95  11  38  86
5  65  87  97   3  60  91  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets at least one item, while the total number of allocated items is exactly seven. A simple approach to achieve this is to assign the highest valued item available to each agent in turn until all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 99).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value 95).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 95).
4. Assign item 5 to agent 5 (value 91).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 79).
6. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 78).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 86).

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonably high-value item according to their preferences, and all items are distributed.
