Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  90  12  64  71   8  48
1  13  58  60  46  20  30  55
2  59  53  89  20  24   9  99
3  46  13  25  54  95  39  90
4  39  43  70  10  35  16  35
5  60  34  26  12   1  35  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [60 34 26 12  1 35 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items to 6 agents, we can aim to distribute the items based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share of total value, while also ensuring that some agents may not get an item due to the limited number of items compared to agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued item for Agent 0 is item 1 (value of 90).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued item for Agent 1 is item 2 (value of 60).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued item for Agent 2 is item 6 (value of 99).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest-valued item for Agent 3 is item 4 (value of 95).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest-valued item for Agent 4 is item 2 (value of 70). However, item 2 is already allocated to Agent 1; the next highest value is item 0 (value of 39).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest-valued item for Agent 5 is item 0 (value of 60). However, item 0 is already allocated to Agent 4; the next highest value is item 6 (value of 74), but item 6 is already allocated to Agent 2; the next highest value is item 5 (value of 35).

Now let's check how many items have been allocated and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [5]

Currently, we've allocated 6 items; item 3 is unallocated. We need to allocate this remaining item:

Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 (value of 64), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
