Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  39  47  40  52  30  10
1  52  77  41  70  98  20  61
2  24  73  25  47  16  36  97
3  58  11  80  74  91  32  16
4  47  73  31  90  12   8  19
5  14  44  83  40  59  26  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Here's one way to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 78.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 with a value of 98.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 6 with a value of 97.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 2 with a value of 80.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 3 with a value of 90.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is item 2 with a value of 83, but item 2 is already taken by Agent 3, so we assign the next highest value, which is item 6 with a value of 68. However, item 6 is already taken, so we assign item 4 with a value of 59. 

Now, let's reallocate to ensure the total number of items is 7:

Since Agent 1 had the second highest value for item 1 at 77, we'll assign item 1 to Agent 1 as well.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item (Agent 1 receives two items), and all 7 items are allocated.
