Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  73  82  36  70  37  97
1  34  67  99  77  95  56  89
2  58  34   3  76   3  38  80
3  98  99  52  41  23  49  93
4  40  96  43  27  59  11  43
5  25  12  53  49  92  98  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations. We can use a heuristic approach to assign the items by selecting the highest available valuation for each item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 3, as they value it the highest at 98.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3, as they value it the highest at 99.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it the highest at 99.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as they value it the highest at 76.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they value it the highest at 95.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5, as they value it the highest at 98.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0, as they value it the highest at 97.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```
