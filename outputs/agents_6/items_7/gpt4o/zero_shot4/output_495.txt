Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  39  47  41  97  58  66
1  26  29  85  85  27  19  33
2  98  35  79  37  16  77  17
3  29  78  14   9  12  50  61
4  10  98  28  29  62  75  90
5  55  72  69  29  67  28  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value of items allocated to each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's attempt to distribute the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them.

Let's consider the following steps for allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 0 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 1 (78).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 1 (98), but since agent 3 already took item 1, we consider the next highest which is item 6 (90).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest remaining value is for item 1 (72), but it's taken. Next highest is item 2 (69), but it's taken. Next available is item 4 (67).

Now, let's check remaining items:

- Items 3 and 5 are left. We need to allocate these to agents who already have items, to ensure all items are assigned.

7. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, who values it at (41).
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 4, who values it at (75).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed, and each agent ends up with items they value significantly.
