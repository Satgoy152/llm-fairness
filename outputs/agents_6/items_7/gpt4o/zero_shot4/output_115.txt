Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  48  24  91  27  22  69
1  91  37  51  59  20  58  74
2  51  55  48  25  20  77   3
3   1  84  74  49  45  81  38
4  80  21  55   1  37  61  24
5  79  69  32  84  45  16  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations. One approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Items 3
- Agent 2: Items 5
- Agent 3: Items 1
- Agent 4: Items 2
- Agent 5: Item 4

This allocation is guided by each agent's highest preferences while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This ensures that all 7 items are allocated among the 6 agents.
