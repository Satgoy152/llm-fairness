Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  99  60   5  25  56   8
1  90  91  52  30   6  13  37
2  66  11  38  92  16  28  22
3  43  94  36  46  71  22  51
4  92  32  25  66  59  73  33
5  90  79  66   5  13  82  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [66 11 38 92 16 28 22]

 [92 32 25 66 59 73 33]
 [90 79 66  5 13 82 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive more than one item.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation.
2. Assign the remaining item to the agent with the second-highest valuation for another item, ensuring no item is left unallocated.

Based on the table:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highest (99).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highest (90).
- Agent 2 values item 3 highest (92).
- Agent 3 values item 1 highest (94), but it's taken. Their next best is item 4 (71).
- Agent 4 values item 0 highest (92), but it's taken. Their next best is item 5 (73).
- Agent 5 values item 5 highest (82).

Now let's allocate:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (99).
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (90).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (92).
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (71).
- Agent 4 gets item 5 (73).
- Agent 5 gets item 6 (90).

Now, we have one item left, item 2, which can be allocated to the agent with the next highest valuation that doesn't already have two items:

- Agent 0: 60
- Agent 1: 52
- Agent 2: 38
- Agent 3: 36
- Agent 4: 25
- Agent 5: 66 (and they already have one item only)

Agent 5 gets item 2.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6, 2]
}
```
