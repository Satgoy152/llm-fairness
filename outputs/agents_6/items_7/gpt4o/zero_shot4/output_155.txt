Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7   5  28  90  98  23  48
1  79  68  57  40  55  21  53
2  44  94  19  64   2  65  50
3  86  73  23   1  74  19  29
4  20  97  24  16  15  78  38
5  38  37  99  86  70  95   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. Additionally, each agent must receive an integer number of items, and exactly 7 items must be allocated among the agents.

One approach to achieve this is to first rank the items by each agent's valuation and then allocate the items to the agents with the highest valuations, ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (98), Item 3 (90), Item 6 (48)
   - Choose Item 4 and Item 3.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (79), Item 1 (68), Item 2 (57)
   - Choose Item 0 and Item 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (94), Item 5 (65), Item 3 (64)
   - Choose Item 5.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (86), Item 4 (74), Item 1 (73)
   - No items remaining with high valuation.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 5 (78), Item 4 (15)
   - No items remaining with high valuation.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (99), Item 5 (95), Item 3 (86)
   - Choose Item 2 and Item 6.

Finally, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.
