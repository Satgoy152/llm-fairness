Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  68   1  18  33  89  49
1  43  44  30   0  91  30  51
2  77   8  52  48  32  81  49
3  72   2   2  28  31  87  51
4  74  61  84  31  64  89  76
5  83   2  20  67  35  73   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation would look:

1. Calculate the maximum valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the maximum valuation for that item.
3. If there's a tie (multiple agents value the item equally and maximally), we can assign it to any one of those agents arbitrarily.

Following these steps, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 5 values it at 83.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 68.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it at 84.
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it at 67.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 91.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 89 (tie between agents 0 and 4, arbitrarily choose agent 0).
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it at 76.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```
