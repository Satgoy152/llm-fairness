Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  16  34  83  85  52  54
1  48  70  65  71   3  99  75
2  48  91  74  51  80  81  67
3  44  76  20  43  25  46  97
4  15  97  42  50  51  65  46
5  78  53  59  34  72  58  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation where each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed. With 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will have to receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 each. 

Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 4 with a value of 85.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 5 with a value of 99.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 1 with a value of 91.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 6 with a value of 97.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 1 with a value of 97, but since it's allocated, we choose item 0 with a value of 15.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation is for item 0 with a value of 78, but since it's allocated, we choose item 2 with a value of 59.

Now, since agent 4 has received a low valuation item, we will consider giving them an additional item. We look for the remaining unallocated item that maximizes the fairness for agent 4. The remaining unallocated item is 3.

The allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives item 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 6.
- Agent 4 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 5 receives item 2.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 3],
    "5": [2]
}
```
