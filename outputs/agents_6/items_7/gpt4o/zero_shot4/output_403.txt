Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  82  21  48  23  61  70
1  68  50  38  45  26  11  11
2  19  39  13   5   8  65  76
3   0  36  19  79  29  81  19
4  34  99  21  78  71  89  62
5  89   8  56   0  28  78  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll use a simple method that aims to balance the total value of items each agent receives. The goal is to ensure each agent receives approximately equal value from the items as per their valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand how much each agent values the items overall.
2. Assign items to agents starting with the highest value for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible.
3. Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are allocated and the distribution is as fair as possible.

Here's an allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so give item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly, so give item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly, so give item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so give item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly, so give item 5 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 2 highly, so give item 2 to agent 5.
- The remaining item 4 can be assigned to the agent who has the least total value so far, which is agent 0.

Now each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items that reflects their preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
