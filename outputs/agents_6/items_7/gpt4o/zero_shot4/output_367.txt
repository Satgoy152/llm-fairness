Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  26  89  90  10  90  52
1  14  50  12   6  62  64  61
2  97  36  84  71  67  82   3
3  99  58  89  93  77   1  44
4  82  26  49  82  57  71  86
5   7  51  92  95  22  80  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. One common method is to use a greedy approach, where we sequentially allocate items based on maximizing the valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 3 highly values items 0 and 3. Allocate items 0 and 3 to agent 3.
2. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 2.
3. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 6. Allocate item 6 to agent 5.
4. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 1.
6. Agent 4 has reasonable valuations across remaining items. Allocate item 1 to agent 4.

After this process, each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, except for agent 4, who receives item 1. The allocation respects the agents' preferences to the best extent possible given the constraints.
