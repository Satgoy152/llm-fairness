Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  79  28  21  81  51  15
1  93  16  48  81  28  90  27
2  77  98  34  61  75  89  48
3   9   1  51  53  59  36  54
4  56  68  23  47  76  93  19
5  36  60  84  65  84  33  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One commonly used method is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, but since there are more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Here's the allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it most at 93.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it most at 98.
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it most at 84.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it most at 81.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it most at 81.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it most at 93.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it most at 54.

Based on this allocation, here is the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and exactly 7 items are distributed among the agents.
