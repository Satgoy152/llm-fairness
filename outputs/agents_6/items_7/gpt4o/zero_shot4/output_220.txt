Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  77   4  60  72   2  12
1  98  29  16   2  74  82  72
2  42  52  28  81  99  68  21
3  52  92  71  20  83  43  71
4  94  42   1  39  42  18  13
5  60  91  50  18  96  67  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider distributing the items such that their individual valuations are maximized for at least one item per agent. This approach uses a strategy where each agent gets at least one item they value highly, if possible, while ensuring all 7 items are distributed.

Hereâ€™s a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 0 (99). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 5 (82). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 4 (99). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 1 (92). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 0 (94), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3 (39). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highly values item 4 (96), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 1 (91), but it's already taken. Then item 2 (50) is the next highest not allocated. Assign item 2 to Agent 5.

Now we have assigned 6 items, one to each agent, with item 6 remaining unallocated. We need to allocate this to one of the agents who values it the most.

7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values item 6 the most (72), and it complements their existing allocation well. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
