Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  43  59  68  42  49  94
1  91  36  45  89  81  72  76
2  30  87  74  42  74  17  11
3   5  81  71  68  98  30  76
4  71  24  28  12  16  65  16
5  34  36  77  65  98  49  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 36 45 89 81 72 76]
 [30 87 74 42 74 17 11]
 [ 5 81 71 68 98 30 76]
 [71 24 28 12 16 65 16]
 [34 36 77 65 98 49 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one item each. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent one item that they value the most, ensuring no two agents choose the same item initially.
2. Assign the remaining item to the agent who would have the highest increase in total valuation from receiving an additional item.

Based on the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (94).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (91).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (87).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (98).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (65).
- Agent 5 values item 4 the most, but it's already allocated, so their next highest is item 2 (77).

All items are allocated with this strategy:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [2]

Now, we need to allocate one additional item. The remaining item is item 3, which has not been allocated. We need to determine which agent would benefit most from receiving item 3:

- Agent 0: 68
- Agent 1: 89
- Agent 2: 42
- Agent 3: 68
- Agent 4: 12
- Agent 5: 65

Agent 1 values item 3 the most. Therefore, we will allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
