Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73   1   6  74  46  81  14
1   0  48  85  47  11   4  80
2  10  55  33  15  22  53  24
3  51  94  95  37  89  20  62
4  79  78  81  17  56  49  12
5  54  25  31  13  56  67  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the preferences of each agent and ensures that each agent gets at least one item, given there are 6 agents and 7 items. One common approach is to use a round-robin allocation method based on each agent's highest valuation for available items. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each agent their most-valued item available, cycling through agents until all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the table:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value item is 5 (value 81).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value item is 2 (value 85).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value item is 1 (value 55).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value item is 2 (value 95), but it's taken, then 1 (value 94).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value item is 2 (value 81), but it's taken, then 0 (value 79).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest value item is 5 (value 67), but it's taken, then 4 (value 56).

After one round, each agent has one item, leaving one item unallocated. We continue:

7. **Remaining Items:** Items left are [0, 3, 6]. We continue allocating based on remaining preferences:

- **Agent 0:** Next highest available is item 3 (value 74).
- **Agent 1:** Next highest available is item 6 (value 80).

At this point, all items have been allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, and all items are allocated. Note that some agents may have ended with more items due to their higher valuations, but all items are distributed among the agents.
