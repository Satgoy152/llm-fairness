Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53   2  94  39  79  20  18
1  24  94  44  46  95  29  28
2  78  57  46  63  96   4  74
3  35  38   5  90  17  29  34
4   8  13   9  74  10  87  10
5  24  45  54  85  89  23  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a simple greedy method where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 78.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 94.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 94.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 90.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 96.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values item 5 the most with a valuation of 87.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values item 6 the most with a valuation of 74.

Let's allocate these items to the agents based on the above decisions:

- Agent 0 gets item [2]
- Agent 1 gets item [1]
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 4, 6]
- Agent 3 gets item [3]
- Agent 4 gets item [5]
- Agent 5 gets no items []

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": []
}
```
