Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17   1  18  39  23  23  38
1  75  30  59  49  81  91  50
2  36  45  54  73  73  94  77
3  84  67  70  77  47  49  31
4  18  33  63  48  11  37  16
5  15  95  40  67  60  70  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll employ a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent. We will take into account the individual valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share of value.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the valuations provided:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's go through each item:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 3 values it the most at 84.

- Item 1:
  - Agent 5 values it the most at 95.

- Item 2:
  - Agent 1 values it the most at 59.

- Item 3:
  - Agent 5 values it the most at 67.

- Item 4:
  - Agent 1 values it the most at 81.

- Item 5:
  - Agent 2 values it the most at 94.

- Item 6:
  - Agent 2 values it the most at 77.

Now, letâ€™s list the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each item has been assigned to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that all 7 items are allocated.
