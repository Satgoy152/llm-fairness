Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  46  26  75  66  70  26
1   4   9  97  73  99  12   3
2  29   0  83  42  40  79  90
3  61  87  23  36  69  43  61
4  41  32  18  60  74  19  17
5  21  43  73  92  13  95  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. We have 6 agents and 7 items, so one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 1 because agent 1 values item 4 highly (99).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 3 because agent 3 values item 0 highly (61).
3. Assign item 6 to agent 2 because agent 2 values item 6 highly (90).
4. Assign item 5 to agent 5 because agent 5 values item 5 highly (95).
5. Assign item 1 to agent 3 because agent 3 values item 1 highly (87).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 0 because agent 0 values item 3 highly (75).
7. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because agent 1 values item 2 highly (97).

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, agent 1 receives 2 items due to their high valuation, while every other agent receives 1 item, except agent 4, who receives none. This allocation is done to maximize the total satisfaction based on the given valuations.
