Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  60  69  71   1  73  54
1  92  43  46  96  38  62  49
2  84  99   5  71  11  22  88
3  61  84  32  14  65  63  83
4  98   7  28  91  78   7  55
5  20  93  42   1  40  17  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can utilize a method that attempts to optimize the allocations based on the agents' valuations for the items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, when possible, and all items are allocated.

Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one possible approach is to assign one item to each agent based on the highest personal valuation, and then allocate the remaining items to the agents who value them the most, taking care to distribute them as evenly as possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Item 4
- Remaining item (2) goes to Agent 0, who values it highly.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and maximizes the individual valuations for the agents.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```
