Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  58  32  20  15  40  54
1  69  68  55  25  81  32  68
2  74  58  46  42  99  71  91
3  58  49  90  86  35  81  73
4  39  88  43  48  73   8  63
5  79  80  17  86   4  29  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll do this by considering each agent's valuation for each item and striving to distribute the items such that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

Here's a plan to allocate the items:

1. Agent 2 values item 4 very highly (99), so we'll assign item 4 to agent 2.
2. Agent 3 values item 2 highly (90), so we'll assign item 2 to agent 3.
3. Agent 4 values item 1 highly (88), so we'll assign item 1 to agent 4.
4. Agent 5 values item 0 highly (79), so we'll assign item 0 to agent 5.
5. Agent 1 values item 6 highly (68), so we'll assign item 6 to agent 1.
6. Agent 3 also values item 3 highly (86), so we'll assign item 3 to agent 3.
7. Agent 0 values item 5 highly (40) compared to other available options, so we'll assign item 5 to agent 0.

Now, each agent either has one item or is compensated by having an item they value highly. This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```
