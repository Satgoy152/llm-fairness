Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  79  72  18  36  98  51
1  66  74  79  81   5  85   7
2  97   4  75   0  67   6  95
3   1  37  68  85  90  18  72
4  42  87   9  59  61   9  39
5   4  53  98  20  69  38  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the overall allocation maximizes the total satisfaction based on the given valuations. Since we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items. We'll aim to maximize the overall value derived by the agents.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 5 values item 2 the highest.
- Assign the remaining item 6 to the agent with the next highest unallocated value, which is Agent 2, who values item 6 highly.

Based on this reasoning, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the satisfaction based on the agents' valuations.
