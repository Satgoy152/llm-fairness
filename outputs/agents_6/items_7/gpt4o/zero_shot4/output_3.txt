Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55   7  70  19   5  81  20
1  54  46  88  35  53  67  47
2  62  69  42  49  89  68  50
3  51  84  21  63  80  99  14
4  71  69  42  60  44  81  98
5  23  43  66  32  68   9  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least some value. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 5 (value 81).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 88).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 89).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 5, but since item 5 is already taken, the next highest is item 1 (value 84).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 6 (value 98).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for Agent 5 is item 6, but since item 6 is already taken, the next highest is item 4 (value 68).

After assigning these items, we have the following situation:
- Items 0 and 3 are unassigned.

We need to assign the remaining items while considering the remaining available highest values for each agent and ensuring fairness. We can distribute them as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (since it's the highest remaining value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (since it's the highest remaining value for Agent 2).

Now, the allocations are complete, and each agent receives at least one item. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```
