Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  70  73  47  96  12  71
1  27  26  29  46  45  87  57
2  72  74   4  25  15  33  22
3  73  34   4  53  72  65  11
4  61  55  87  62  64  31  46
5  85  22  55  45  74  11  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to try to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated. Given the constraints, here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 4 (96) and a high valuation for item 0 (93).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 5 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 1 (74).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 0 (73) but it has already been allocated, so we assign the next highest, item 3 (53).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 2 (87).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for agent 5 is item 6 (92).

Let's allocate these items based on the highest valuation for each agent, ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent:

- Agent 0: [4] (Item 4)
- Agent 1: [5] (Item 5)
- Agent 2: [1] (Item 1)
- Agent 3: [3] (Item 3)
- Agent 4: [2] (Item 2)
- Agent 5: [6, 0] (Items 6 and 0)

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets items in line with their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6, 0]
}
```
