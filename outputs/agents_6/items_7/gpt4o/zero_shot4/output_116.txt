Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13   4  45   2  39   0  61
1   8  28  39  13  78  55   4
2  29   5  87  70  75  54  92
3  36  64  13  61  21  12  86
4  96  87  25  41  40  45  71
5  47  79  45  88  44  15  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued item for Agent 0 is item 6 (value 61).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued item for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 78).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued item for Agent 2 is item 2 (value 87).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest-valued item for Agent 3 is item 1 (value 64).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest-valued item for Agent 4 is item 0 (value 96).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest-valued item for Agent 5 is item 3 (value 88).

These allocations cover one item for each agent and utilize 6 of the 7 items. Now, we need to allocate the remaining item, which is item 5.

- **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 5 (value 55), which is the highest among all agents who have not yet received a second item.

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed based on the highest valuations.
