Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  45  96  77  82  56   0
1  33  32  33  74  87  68  20
2  44  19  15  41  90  92  44
3  61  42  53  89  57  83  99
4  98  14  82  99  18  42  98
5  21  36  98  39  24  88  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [98 14 82 99 18 42 98]
 [21 36 98 39 24 88 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while distributing the items as evenly as possible. Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's analyze the highest valuations to decide how to distribute the items:

1. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0 with a value of 98.
2. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 2 with a value of 98.
3. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 99.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6 with a value of 99.
5. Agent 0 has the second highest valuation for item 2 with a value of 96.
6. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 with a value of 92.
7. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 with a value of 87.

Now, let's distribute the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 4 gets items 0 and 3 (highest total valuation for two items).
- Agent 5 gets item 2 (highest valuation for item 2).
- Agent 3 gets item 6 (highest valuation for item 6).
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (highest valuation for item 5).
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (highest valuation for item 4).
- Agent 0 initially gets no items, but we will give item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 3],
    "5": [2]
}
```
