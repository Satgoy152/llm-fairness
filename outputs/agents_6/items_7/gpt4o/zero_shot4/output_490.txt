Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  78  83  67  45   1  97
1  56  99   5  53  30  22  96
2  55  67  51  39  17   9   8
3  61  77  63  13   6   1   1
4  91  93  87  58  26  44  65
5  70  48  84   6   4  39  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a total value from their allocated items that is somewhat balanced relative to the others. Since we have 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive an extra item. We'll attempt to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as even as possible.

Below is one potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 13).
2. Assign item 6 to agent 1 (value: 96).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value: 67).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value: 13).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value: 26).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 5 (value: 84).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value: 1). (Agent 0 receives an extra item due to the odd number of items)

This allocation tries to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
``` 

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives either one or two items, maintaining fairness given the constraints.
