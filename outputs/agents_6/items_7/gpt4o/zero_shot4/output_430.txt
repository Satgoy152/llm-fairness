Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  57  88   9  89  32  47
1  38  92  53  88  43  40  80
2  35  42  41   6  96  13  50
3   4  19  98  90  60  38  89
4  75  27  67   9  21  49  37
5  39  57  39  16  31  43  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent assigns to the items. A common method to achieve a fair allocation is to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable value from the items they receive, while all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1, so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 4, so allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3, so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 0, so allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 can be allocated item 5.
7. Finally, allocate item 6 to agent 3 as agent 3 values item 6 reasonably well.

This allocation ensures that all agents get at least some value, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
