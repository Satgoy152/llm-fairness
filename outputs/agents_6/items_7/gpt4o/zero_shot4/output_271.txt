Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  23  64   9  94  10  13
1  39   7  46  88  57  45  29
2   9  53  58  16  51  66  30
3  24  60  64  84  27  93   7
4  21   1  75  96  64  99  94
5  12  92  92  34  89  67  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied as much as possible given their preferences. One approach is to consider a simple allocation that aims to balance the total value each agent receives. 

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 0 and 6.
2. Agent 1 receives item 3.
3. Agent 2 receives item 5.
4. Agent 3 receives item 2.
5. Agent 4 receives item 4.
6. Agent 5 receives item 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 7. Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
