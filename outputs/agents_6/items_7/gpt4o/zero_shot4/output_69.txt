Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  47   3  10  82  22   1
1  58  21  77   2  79   6  44
2  26  66  99  42  88  50  75
3  14  50  50  16  51  13  40
4  98  63  10  63  57   6  23
5  50  36  28   2  97  90  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction with their assigned items. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives their highest-valued items whenever possible, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items.

To do this, we can follow these steps:
1. Determine each agent's highest-valued items.
2. Allocate items to the agents based on their preferences, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and every item is allocated.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for item 4 (82), item 1 (47), and item 0 (27).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for item 2 (77), item 4 (79), and item 0 (58).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for item 2 (99), item 4 (88), and item 6 (75).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for item 4 (51), item 1 (50), and item 2 (50).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for item 0 (98), item 1 (63), and item 3 (63).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest values are for item 4 (97), item 6 (93), and item 5 (90).

Based on these preferences, we can try to allocate the items as follows:

- **Allocate item 4**: Highest value by Agent 5.
- **Allocate item 2**: Highest value by Agent 2.
- **Allocate item 6**: Next highest value for Agent 5.
- **Allocate item 0**: Highest value by Agent 4.
- **Allocate item 1**: Next highest value for Agent 4.
- **Allocate item 5**: Next highest value for Agent 5.
- **Allocate item 3**: Next highest value for Agent 4.

After considering the preferences and ensuring all items are allocated, we get the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 1, 3],
    "5": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to an agent, and the distribution attempts to maximize agent satisfaction based on their highest preferences.
