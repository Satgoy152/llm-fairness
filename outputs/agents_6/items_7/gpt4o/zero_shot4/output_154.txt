Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90   1   1  76  11  55   0
1  70  67  23  43  75  77  65
2   0  35  61  28  34  44  44
3   5  64  88  51  41  26  27
4  15  65  53  94  88  41  42
5  58  96  59  15  96  96  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 67 23 43 75 77 65]
 [ 0 35 61 28 34 44 44]

 [58 96 59 15 96 96 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use an algorithm that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item. A common approach to such a problem is using the "Hungarian Algorithm" for optimal assignment. However, given the constraints and the number of agents and items, we can also manually attempt to distribute the items to maximize fairness.

Here is one possible way to allocate the items fairly among the agents:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (valuation 90 is the highest for item 0).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 5 (valuation 96 is the highest for item 1).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (valuation 88 is the highest for item 2).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (valuation 94 is the highest for item 3).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (valuation 75 is the highest for item 4).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5 (valuation 96 is the highest for item 5).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1 (valuation 65 is the highest for item 6).

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent's allocation is based on maximizing their valuations while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.
