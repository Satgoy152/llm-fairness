Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  68  38  64  19   6  37
1  71  32  20  64  10  84   2
2  17   6  84  75  19  66  50
3  13  44  22  13  95  92  82
4  85  39  44  60  66  29  69
5  67  11  39   2  37  81   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.

First, let's look at the top preferences for each agent:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (83).
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most (84).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (84).
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most (95).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the most (85), but since it's already allocated, their second highest is item 6 (69).
6. Agent 5 values item 5 the most (81), but since it's already allocated, their second highest is item 0 (67), but it's already allocated as well, so we move to item 6 (2) since it's free and the last item.

Let's allocate the items based on the above preferences while ensuring that no item is allocated more than once and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [1, 3]

Now, let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
