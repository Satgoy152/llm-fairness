Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  95  39  25  89  24  20
1  31  17  14   5   4  90  31
2  70  19  10  64  75  63   3
3  32  44  24  87  68  96  31
4  55  86  46  88  79  17  27
5  23  22   6  54   0  45  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [23 22  6 54  0 45 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. One way to attempt fairness is to consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that allocations are relatively balanced.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Item 2

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2]
}
```
