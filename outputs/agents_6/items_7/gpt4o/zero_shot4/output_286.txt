Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44   4  58  96  62  11  86
1  32  25  61  50  46  45  79
2  57  62  92   4  60   2  59
3  87  42   8  36  44  22  35
4  89  70  33  78  72  21  10
5  52  56  81  57  11   8  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item if possible. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive two items, while others will receive one item each.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0: The highest valuation for agent 0 is item 3 with a value of 96.
2. Agent 1: The highest valuation for agent 1 is item 6 with a value of 79.
3. Agent 2: The highest valuation for agent 2 is item 2 with a value of 92.
4. Agent 3: The highest valuation for agent 3 is item 0 with a value of 87.
5. Agent 4: The highest valuation for agent 4 is item 1 with a value of 70.
6. Agent 5: The highest valuation for agent 5 is item 2, but it's already allocated, so we choose the next highest, item 5, with a value of 8.

Since all agents have received one item and there is one item left (item 4), it should be allocated to an agent who would value it reasonably well and fairly balance the total allocations. Agent 4 has a fair valuation of item 4 at 72. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
