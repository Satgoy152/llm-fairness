Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  52  99  54  66  22  39
1   2  54   5  23  48  46  57
2  31  94   1   4  99  20  49
3  36  69  90  83  81  56  99
4  22  19  84  16   4  68  23
5  32  34  94  28  96  28  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction by giving each agent the item(s) they value the most, while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 99). Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation is for item 6 (value 57). Allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 99). Allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 6, but it's already allocated. Next, item 2 is also taken. Allocate item 3 (value 83) to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (value 68). Allocate item 5 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 4, but it's already allocated. Next, allocate item 0 (value 32) to agent 5.

Finally, allocate the remaining items to the agents who have the highest remaining valuations for those items:

- Allocate item 1 (highest remaining valuation is 94 by agent 2) to agent 2.
- Allocate item 6 to agent 3 (highest remaining valuation is 99 by agent 3).

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and agents receive items they highly value.
