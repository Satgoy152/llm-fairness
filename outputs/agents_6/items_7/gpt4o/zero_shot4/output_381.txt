Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  78   0  41  71  91  77
1  39  54  29  52  93  33  61
2  42  17  62  78  81  46  91
3  74  19  11  74  69  18   3
4  20  74  78  34  52  37  24
5   0  83  76  88  10   4  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 78  0 41 71 91 77]
 [39 54 29 52 93 33 61]
 [42 17 62 78 81 46 91]
 [74 19 11 74 69 18  3]
 [20 74 78 34 52 37 24]
 [ 0 83 76 88 10  4 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Below is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by agent 0 with 77.
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by agent 5 with 83.
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by agent 4 with 78.
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by agent 5 with 88.
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by agent 1 with 93.
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by agent 0 with 91.
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is by agent 2 with 91.

Reviewing the allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item and making necessary adjustments:

- Agent 0: Item 0 and Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: No items initially; adjust by reassigning Item 3 from agent 5
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 1 (after giving up item 3)

Final allocations ensuring adjustments:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
