Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  31  96  37  42  44  40
1  54  71  19  76  23  28  83
2  93   1   6  56  73  87  49
3  57  62   2  53  81  42  66
4   6  65  65  58  93  79   7
5  89  37  86   9  23   5  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. We'll aim to distribute the items such that the allocations are as equitable as possible based on the given valuations.

One possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no conflicts arise in item allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 99.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 71.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 96.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 76.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 with a value of 93.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 87.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 83.

This distribution allows for a fair allocation based on the highest valuations for each item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 3, and 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 doesn't receive any items.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 doesn't receive any items.

This ensures all 7 items are allocated, and each agent is considered.
