Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  79  52  75  73  42  22
1  64  17   6  10  54  92  90
2  25  35   4  25  30   8  97
3  35  63  94  67  57  19  68
4  30  57  79  38  36  76  73
5   0  38  13  44  58   0  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each. Here's one way to do this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If an agent ends up with more than 2 items, reassign items to other agents who value them the most among the remaining agents.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (64).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (79).
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (94).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (75).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (73).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (92).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (97).

With this initial allocation, Agent 0 ends up with items 1, 3, and 4. To fairly distribute the items, we can reassign:

- Item 3 to Agent 3, who values it second highest (67).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
