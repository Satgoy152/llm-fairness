Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  98  20  55  40  28  21
1  58  99  64  76  14  90  93
2  88  98  58  87  92  32  34
3  63  86  12  26  66  69  99
4  53   5  54  14  55  16  90
5  40  36   3  46  76  22  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total valuation each agent gets based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and exactly seven items are allocated in total.

Below is one possible allocation approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item whenever possible.
2. Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 2 (value 88)
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 1 (value 99)
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (value 64)
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 2 (value 87)
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 2 (value 92)
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 3 (value 69)
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 3 (value 99)

Following this allocation strategy ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it highly, while also ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3, 4],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
