Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  66  59  89  26   3  56
1   5  52  47  82  68  43  55
2  89  90  55  30  22  58  58
3  98  48  76  55  45  69  96
4  58  39  94  23  74  61  45
5  84  75  68  38   9  51  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) given that there are 7 items and 6 agents. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Begin by identifying the highest valuation for each agent. This helps ensure that each agent receives at least one highly valued item.
2. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
3. Adjust allocations to guarantee every item is allocated.

Following this strategy, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (Value = 89)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (Value = 47)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (Value = 90)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (Value = 98)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (Value = 74)
- Agent 5: Items 5 and 6 (Values = 51 and 81)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
