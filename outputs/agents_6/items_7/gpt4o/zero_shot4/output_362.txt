Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  88   2  98  70  84  62
1  33  74  37  24   4  46  62
2  38  61  88   2  27  23  55
3  23  99  39   2  57  15  42
4  11  97  57  67  70  38  25
5  26  65  30  48  28  68  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 88  2 98 70 84 62]
 [33 74 37 24  4 46 62]
 [38 61 88  2 27 23 55]
 [23 99 39  2 57 15 42]
 [11 97 57 67 70 38 25]
 [26 65 30 48 28 68 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to give each agent at least one item while maximizing their preferences. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items. We will focus on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive:

1. Agent 0: Item 3 (98)
2. Agent 1: Item 1 (74)
3. Agent 2: Item 2 (88)
4. Agent 3: Item 4 (57)
5. Agent 4: Item 5 (38)
6. Agent 5: Item 6 (71)

Now we have 1 item left, and one agent needs to have 2 items. By reviewing the remaining items, item 0 can be allocated to agent 0, who has the highest remaining valuation for it (87).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
