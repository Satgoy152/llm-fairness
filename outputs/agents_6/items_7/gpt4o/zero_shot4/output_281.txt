Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  91  84  54  81  44  58
1  56  39  67  94  14  65  76
2  25  39  17  58  68  36  83
3  91  74  26  36  42  52  86
4  62  19  50  64  36  69  48
5  52   9  13  94  53  54  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 91 84 54 81 44 58]
 [56 39 67 94 14 65 76]
 [25 39 17 58 68 36 83]
 [91 74 26 36 42 52 86]
 [62 19 50 64 36 69 48]
 [52  9 13 94 53 54 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Since there are 7 items, and 6 agents, one agent will end up with 2 items.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1. 
2. Agent 1 values item 3 very highly.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 6.
4. Agent 3 has a strong preference for item 5.
5. Agent 4 can take item 2.
6. Agent 5 can take item 4.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1 (98, 91)
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (94)
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (83)
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (52)
- Agent 4 gets item 2 (50)
- Agent 5 gets item 4 (53)

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```
