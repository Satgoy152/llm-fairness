Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  79  51  59  62  50  87
1  64  77  71  53  65  15  78
2  35  48  34  72   8  86  92
3  91  13  25  46  46  88   7
4  23  79   4  51   6  73   3
5  98  28  22  50  39  24  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 28 22 50 39 24 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. We also need to consider the valuations to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness or efficiency.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 6 (value 87)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 (value 71)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 5 (value 86)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 0 (value 91)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 1 (value 79)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 3 (value 50)
7. **Agent 5**: Item 4 (value 39)

With this distribution, each agent receives at least one high-value item relative to their preferences, and all 7 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```
