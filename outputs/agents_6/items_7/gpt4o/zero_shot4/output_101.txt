Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  79  41  64  87  86  18
1   4  44  19  77  90  60  45
2  43  35  42  45  97  95  40
3  35  34  57   4  95  44  25
4  22  90  32  11  85  45  95
5  46  95  40  70  96  91  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This method helps ensure that each item is allocated to an agent who derives the maximum benefit from it.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 76 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 5.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 57 by Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 77 by Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 97 by Agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 2 (note: Agent 2 gets another item, but this is the next highest valuation).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 4.

Given these allocations based on the highest valuations, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most while ensuring all items are allocated.
