Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  22   1  19  84  69  35
1  12  56  13   0  61  88  70
2   9  85  75  99  19  16  96
3  52  89  68  96  72  62  74
4  56  67  27  39   7  92  11
5  79  75  11  94  63  28  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, given there are 6 agents and 7 items. Below is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 highly.

This leaves item 2 which has to be allocated to one of the agents. Considering the remaining values:

- Agent 2 has already received item 3, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 has received item 5, which they value highly, but they also value item 2 moderately.
- Agent 0 values item 2 the least among the agents.

Therefore, it might make sense to assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they have a moderate valuation for it.

Based on this strategy, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item (except for one agent), and the allocation is based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction where possible.
