Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  34   1  99   4   9  10
1  46  28   3  41  57  48  70
2   8  51  35  24  90  13  37
3  22  26  51  19  87  73  98
4  40  19   2  38  68  21  67
5  67  60  16  99  66  71  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to balance the distribution based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given the constraints of 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will inevitably receive two items. Let's allocate these items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent. 

Looking at the table, we can identify the highest valuations for each agent and attempt to assign items accordingly:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is 99 for item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is 70 for item 6.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is 90 for item 4.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is 98 for item 6 (already taken by Agent 1), so the next highest is 87 for item 4 (already taken by Agent 2), then 73 for item 5.
- **Agent 4**: Highest value is 68 for item 4 (already taken by Agent 2), so the next highest is 67 for item 6 (already taken by Agent 1), then 40 for item 0.
- **Agent 5**: Highest value is 99 for item 3 (already taken by Agent 0), so the next highest is 71 for item 5 (already taken by Agent 3), then 67 for item 0 (already taken by Agent 4).

After initially allocating the highest possible items to each agent, we have:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 3
2. **Agent 1**: Item 6
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4
4. **Agent 3**: Item 5
5. **Agent 4**: Item 0
6. **Agent 5**: No item assigned yet

Now we need to assign the remaining items 1 and 2, and adjust allocations to ensure all agents have at least one item:

- For item 1, Agent 5 has the highest valuation among those without an item at 60.
- For item 2, Agent 1 values it at 3, but since Agent 1 already has an item and Agent 5 needs one, we assign it to Agent 5.

Final allocations are:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Items 1, 2

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```
