Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  20  98  77  62  88  46
1  52  57  56  96  21  96  43
2  21  35   3  60  34  95  42
3  36  52  92  90  18  59   0
4  73  18  13  97  77  49  53
5  86  69  81  31  30  89  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 1, so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 2, so allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 is already allocated, so the next highest, Item 2, is already allocated, too. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate Item 4 to Agent 4 as it provides a high value.
6. **Agent 5**: Item 0 is already allocated. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 5, as it offers a good value.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
