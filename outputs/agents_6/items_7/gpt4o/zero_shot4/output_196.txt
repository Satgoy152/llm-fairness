Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  66  80  35  52  98  19
1  77  10  84  82  17  44  32
2  79  20  39  96  86  46  70
3  92  23  29  54  57   2  31
4  28  60  37  42  23  17  20
5  90  50  62   0  72  22   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach to maximize the total valuation received by each agent. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. We'll approach this by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that no agent receives more than 2 items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by agent 3 (92).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by agent 0 (66).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by agent 0 (80).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by agent 2 (96).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by agent 2 (86).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by agent 0 (98).
7. Item 6 is valued highest by agent 2 (70).

Since agent 0 is already assigned 2 items, we need to adjust:

- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (44) instead of agent 0.
  
Now, let's check and finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4, 6
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
