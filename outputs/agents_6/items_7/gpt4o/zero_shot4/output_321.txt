Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  27  67  36  48  63  36
1  24  21  88  65  87  67  53
2  37  30  24  81  54  90  54
3  11   5  16  74  57   1  45
4  99  33  12  27  48  12  71
5  97  24  26   3  22  72  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that the allocation maximizes the total satisfaction across all agents. Below is one potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 4 highly values item 0 (99), so allocate item 0 to agent 4.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (88), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 5 (90), so allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 0 highly values item 5 (63) but it was already allocated to agent 2, so allocate item 6 (36) to agent 0 which is the next highest value.
5. Agent 3 highly values item 3 (74), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 0 (97) but it was already allocated to agent 4, the next highest is item 5 (72) but it was also allocated, so item 6 (28) is next, but it's already allocated, so consider item 4 (22).
7. Lastly, allocate remaining item 1 to agent 0 since agent 0 only has one item so far and its value (27) is still relatively high for agent 0.

Given these considerations, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This ensures that each agent receives at least one item (except for agent 5, who receives the last possible allocation), and all 7 items are allocated.
