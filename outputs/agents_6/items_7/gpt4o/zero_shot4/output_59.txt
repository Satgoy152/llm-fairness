Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55   7  84  35  92  71  59
1  71  31  28  21  41   1  18
2  73  49  38  96  55  29   4
3  46  10  42  21  50  51  87
4  65  95  43  83  58  75  78
5  47  45  26  11  91  62  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [71 31 28 21 41  1 18]
 [73 49 38 96 55 29  4]

 [47 45 26 11 91 62 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to allocate all 7 items to the 6 agents. Here is a potential allocation:

1. Assign the highest-valued item to each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
2. Allocate any remaining items to the agents with the highest additional value.

Following this method, here's a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 4 (value 92)
2. Agent 1: Item 0 (value 71)
3. Agent 2: Item 3 (value 96)
4. Agent 3: Item 6 (value 87)
5. Agent 4: Items 1 and 5 (values 95 and 75)
6. Agent 5: Item 2 (value 26)

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all 7 items are allocated.
