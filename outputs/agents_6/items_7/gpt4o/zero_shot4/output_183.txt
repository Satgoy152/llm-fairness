Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  46   7  71  48  75  51
1  63  74  57  32  89  59  64
2  29  66  27  29  27  43  32
3  49  41  54  80  76  12  91
4  71  72  31  64   4   9  19
5  45  28  87  79  62  93  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive. We'll do this by ensuring that each agent either receives items they value highly, while trying to distribute items in a way that keeps the distribution fair across agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 0 (value 86)
2. Agent 1: Item 4 (value 89)
3. Agent 2: Item 1 (value 66)
4. Agent 3: Item 6 (value 91)
5. Agent 4: Item 3 (value 64)
6. Agent 5: Items 2 and 5 (values 87 and 93)

Each agent gets at least one item, except for agent 4, who receives an item with reasonably high value for them. This allocation aims to distribute the items such that the items are allocated based on high valuation by the agents.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
