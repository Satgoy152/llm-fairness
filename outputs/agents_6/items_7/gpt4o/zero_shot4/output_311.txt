Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  40  25  91  23   4  74
1  90  72  22  46  67  16  29
2  71  21  79  48  67   2  92
3  37  28  22  31  61   3  55
4  28  34  58  78  65  65  95
5  40  76  81  13   8  36   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items assigned to them. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items based on the highest valuation for each item.

Let's go through the process of allocating the items to the agents:

1. Look at each item and determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign that item to the agent who values it the highest.
3. Ensure that every item is allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most (90).
- **Item 1**: Agent 5 values it the most (76).
- **Item 2**: Agent 5 values it the most (81).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (91).
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 and Agent 1 both value it at 67, but we'll assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it the most (65).
- **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most (95).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are allocated.
