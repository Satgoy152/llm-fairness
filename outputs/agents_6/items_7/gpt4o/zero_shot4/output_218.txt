Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  81   5  44  64  11  44
1  71  68   5  59  55  87  89
2  38  11  14  71  59  63  45
3  24  94  43  19   0  23  38
4  28  10  83  70  49  20  69
5  10  73  60  28   1  52  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will allocate exactly 7 items, with each agent receiving at least 0 items and possibly more, but ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 (81) and 4 (64).
2. **Agent 1** values items 5 (87) and 6 (89) the most.
3. **Agent 2** prefers items 3 (71) and 5 (63).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 1 (94).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 2 (83).
6. **Agent 5** shows preference for items 1 (73) and 6 (70).

Considering these valuations, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items: [1]
- Agent 1 gets items: [6]
- Agent 2 gets items: [3]
- Agent 3 gets items: []
- Agent 4 gets items: [2]
- Agent 5 gets items: [0, 4, 5]

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives items that closely match their highest valuations, while also distributing all items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 4, 5]
}
```
