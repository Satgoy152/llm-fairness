Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  65  96  81  36  11  84
1  78  49  16  17  93  53  90
2   2  37  76  10  27  11  25
3  75  68  54  37  60  76  85
4  76  58   1   9  73  77  66
5  81  31  50  57  95  10  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent can receive at least one item if possible, and no agent receives more than one extra item than any other agent (ensuring a fair distribution of items). We have 6 agents and 7 items, so one agent will end up with one more item than the others. Let's allocate the items accordingly:

1. Start by allocating high-value items to agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Allocate the remaining item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that the distribution remains fair.

Based on the table:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, but since agent 0 also values it and has fewer high-value options, we give agent 2 item 6.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly, but since agent 2 also values it and has fewer high-value options, we give agent 3 item 5.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly, but since agent 1 also values it and has fewer high-value options, we give agent 5 item 0.

Let's assign the items:

- Assign item 2 (value 96) to agent 0.
- Assign item 4 (value 93) to agent 1.
- Assign item 6 (value 25) to agent 2.
- Assign item 5 (value 76) to agent 3.
- Assign item 0 (value 76) to agent 4.
- Assign item 1 (value 31) to agent 5.

Now, we have one more item, item 3 (value 81). It is fair to give this item to agent 0, who values it highly and currently has only one item.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
