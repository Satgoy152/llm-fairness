Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  82  77  21  19  46  76
1  71   3  15  70  79  34  30
2  51  15  19  11   2   4  89
3  96  59  70  19  47  85  90
4  94  21  49  18  58  47  19
5   4  28  74  54  86  67  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. A common strategy in such problems is to look for a way to maximize the overall valuations while keeping the allocation fair. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Values for items are [5, 82, 77, 21, 19, 46, 76]
2. Agent 1: Values for items are [71, 3, 15, 70, 79, 34, 30]
3. Agent 2: Values for items are [51, 15, 19, 11, 2, 4, 89]
4. Agent 3: Values for items are [96, 59, 70, 19, 47, 85, 90]
5. Agent 4: Values for items are [94, 21, 49, 18, 58, 47, 19]
6. Agent 5: Values for items are [4, 28, 74, 54, 86, 67, 65]

Let's allocate the items by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0 (value: 96) goes to Agent 3.
- Item 1 (value: 82) goes to Agent 0.
- Item 2 (value: 77) goes to Agent 0.
- Item 3 (value: 70) goes to Agent 1.
- Item 4 (value: 86) goes to Agent 5.
- Item 5 (value: 85) goes to Agent 3.
- Item 6 (value: 90) goes to Agent 3.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items [0, 5, 6]
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Item [4]

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 5, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4]
}
```
