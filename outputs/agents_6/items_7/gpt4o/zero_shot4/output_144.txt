Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  72  22  58  73  12  85
1  55  28  10  84  83  91  54
2  27  53  88  97  95   4  15
3   8  77  78   6  15  51   7
4  91  27  51  65  70  71  79
5   0  48  47  76  57  60  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets items they value as much as possible while ensuring no item is left unallocated and all items are distributed among the agents. 

Here's one way to approach this:

1. Prioritize items for agents based on their highest value for those items.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, but in this scenario, the focus will be more on overall value maximization and fair distribution.
3. Distribute the items to maximize total satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (85).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (91).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (97).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (77).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (91).
- Agent 5 values item 4 the most (57).

Now, we have allocated one item to each agent based on their highest valuation. We have one item left, item 2. To allocate it fairly:

- The highest remaining valuation for item 2 comes from agent 2 (88).

Allocating the items based on this approach:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is based on maximizing individual satisfaction with respect to their highest valuations.
