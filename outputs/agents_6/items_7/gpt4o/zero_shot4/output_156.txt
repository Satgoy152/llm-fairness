Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  26  40   8   4  36   9
1  11  23  22  90  85  82  23
2   7  32  45  43  92  47  71
3  86  95  78  96  23  53  83
4  80  81  35  14  84  36  98
5  58  42  41  97  13  97  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. Given there are 6 agents and 7 items, not all agents will receive the same number of items. We need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items to maximize individual satisfaction.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Start by examining the highest valuations each agent has for the items.
2. Assign the items with the highest valuations to the corresponding agents, ensuring that each item is only assigned once.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Based on the provided valuations, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 3 values item 3 the most among all agents.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly, tied with agent 3's valuation.
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 0 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 0 also values item 0 highly, and it remains unallocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.
