Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  86  29  16  77  49  41
1  32   9  69  57  45  76  84
2  73  38  31  69  77  33  81
3  63  55  37  87  96  98   5
4  73  22  23  74  98  14  27
5  91  14  88  30  36  23  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items allocated. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each. Here's a potential fair allocation:

1. Agent 0: Assign item 4 (valued at 77) to Agent 0, as it is one of the higher values for this agent.
2. Agent 1: Assign item 5 (valued at 76) to Agent 1, as it is the highest value for this agent.
3. Agent 2: Assign item 6 (valued at 81) to Agent 2, as it is the highest value for this agent.
4. Agent 3: Assign item 3 (valued at 87) to Agent 3, as it is the highest value for this agent.
5. Agent 4: Assign item 0 (valued at 73) to Agent 4, as it is one of the highest values for this agent.
6. Agent 5: Assign items 2 (valued at 88) and 1 (valued at 14) to Agent 5, maximizing their value.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and that all items are distributed.
