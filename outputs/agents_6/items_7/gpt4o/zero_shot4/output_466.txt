Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  35  52  16  94  25  50
1  38  32  52  51  15  25  25
2  94  79  17  77  62  55  88
3  13  56  94  68  11  32  33
4  97  36  76  97  43  51  29
5  45  44   3   1  55  80   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total valuations. One approach to achieve fairness is to use a method that tries to maximize the minimum satisfaction or minimize the maximum envy among agents. However, given the small size of the problem and the need to allocate exactly 7 items, a simpler heuristic can be utilized.

In this scenario, let's distribute the items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that every item is assigned to an agent who values it the most. If an agent has already received one item, preference can be adjusted to accommodate other agents to ensure a fair distribution of items.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0 has the highest value for agent 4 (97).
2. Item 1 has the highest value for agent 2 (79).
3. Item 2 has the highest value for agent 3 (94).
4. Item 3 has the highest value for agent 4 (97).
5. Item 4 has the highest value for agent 0 (94).
6. Item 5 has the highest value for agent 5 (80).
7. Item 6 has the highest value for agent 2 (88).

The allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent who values it the most, while also trying to distribute the items evenly among the agents. Based on this reasoning, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated to the agents, and each agent receives at least one item where possible, given the constraint of having exactly 7 items.
