Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97   1  89  29  66  31  16
1  88  55  75   4  31  46  10
2  89  29  98  42  21  26  34
3  49  99  15  42  52  10  48
4  43  95  87  99  84  82  14
5   8  96  81  21  75   8  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 97 is the highest).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 99 is the highest).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 98 is the highest).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value 99 is the highest).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 84 is the highest among remaining).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 46 is the highest among remaining).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 48 is the highest among remaining).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and tries to maximize the total value received by each agent.
