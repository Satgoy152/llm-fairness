Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  84  50  80  31  35  42
1  27  15  34  19  22  48  88
2  54  72  72  82  87   7   9
3  63  91  48   9  91  45  26
4  76  66  93   2  23  37  89
5  20  78  71  39  85  17  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that exactly 7 items are allocated in total. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Find the highest valuation for each item and allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure that no agent receives more items than reasonable, and adjust allocations if necessary to maintain fairness.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 89 by agent 0.
- **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 91 by agent 3.
- **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 93 by agent 4.
- **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 82 by agent 2.
- **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 91 by agent 3.
- **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 48 by agent 1.
- **Item 6**: The highest valuation is 88 by agent 1.

Now, we'll allocate the items based on these observations:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [5, 6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1, 4]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: []

Ensuring that exactly 7 items are allocated, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```
