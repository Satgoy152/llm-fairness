Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20   0  35  42  16  20  47
1  24  37  92  23  29  99  35
2  65  69  52  59  19  16   6
3  12  70  67   0  38  62  29
4  21  49  76  72  55  80  67
5  98  42  60  46  79  23  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the utility for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive an additional item. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item, if possible.
2. Assign the remaining item to the agent who has the next highest valuation for an unallocated item.

Following these steps, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: The highest value is for item 6 (value 47).
- Agent 1: The highest value is for item 5 (value 99).
- Agent 2: The highest value is for item 1 (value 69).
- Agent 3: The highest value is for item 1 (value 70), but item 1 is already taken. The next highest available is item 5 (value 62), but it is also taken. The next highest is item 2 (value 67).
- Agent 4: The highest value is for item 5 (value 80), but it is already taken. The next highest available is item 2 (value 76), but it is also taken. The next highest is item 3 (value 72).
- Agent 5: The highest value is for item 0 (value 98).

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and we need to allocate one more item. The remaining items are 3 and 4. We will choose based on the remaining highest valuations for these items:

- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4 (value 38).

Thus, a possible allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are distributed.
