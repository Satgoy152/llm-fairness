Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  39  98  69  17  18  84
1  37  99  68   6  61  43  29
2  51  49  83  35  30  10  59
3  60  27  65  23  58  34  14
4  78  30  42  98  69  95   8
5  22  93  25  95  10  52  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent ends up with a fair share based on their preferences. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (98), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly (99), so assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly (83), but it's already taken. Item 6 is the next highest (59), so assign item 6 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3's highest valuation is item 0 (60), so assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly (98), so assign item 3 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 highly (93), but it's already taken. Item 3 is also highly valued (95), but it's taken. The next highest is item 5 (52), so assign item 5 to agent 5.
7. Now, the only item left is item 4, which can be allocated to any agent with no items or as an additional item based on remaining preference. Let's allocate it to agent 4 as they highly value item 4 (69).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and each agent's preferences are considered as much as possible given the constraints.
