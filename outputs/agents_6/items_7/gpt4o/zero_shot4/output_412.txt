Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  75  41  21  88  60  46
1  87  84  88   9  23   8  69
2  15  15  97   6  80  30  22
3  66  35   5  42  43  15  33
4  90  81  42  15  40  21  54
5   7  48  12  32  72  95  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring every agent receives at least one item. We'll try to distribute items based on the highest value for each agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (Value: 88)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (Value: 88)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (Value: 30)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (Value: 66)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (Value: 81)
- Agent 5: Item 6 (Value: 52)
- Remaining item (Item 3) can be allocated to the agent who sees the most value in it, which is Agent 0 (Value: 21)

This allocation ensures every agent receives exactly one item, and Agent 0 receives two items as they have the highest remaining value for the leftover item.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations.
