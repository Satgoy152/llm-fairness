Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  13  90   1  81  47  12
1  25  51  48  70  10  73   7
2  45  49  42  40  47  95   6
3  74  14  31  83  63   9   1
4  44   4  35   7  19  32  43
5  77  10  83  72  21  30  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 51 48 70 10 73  7]
 [45 49 42 40 47 95  6]

 [77 10 83 72 21 30 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use the max-min fairness approach, aiming to maximize the minimum valuation that each agent receives from their allocated items. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Let's consider the valuations and assign items to agents based on maximizing their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5, but since it's already assigned, we'll assign item 5 to agent 1 and look for the next best for agent 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 6.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 0.

After assigning the highest valued items where applicable, we continue with the remaining items:

- Item 1 is not yet assigned, and agent 1 has the second-highest valuation for item 1.
- Item 4 is not yet assigned, and it can be assigned to agent 2 as they have the highest remaining valuation for item 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
