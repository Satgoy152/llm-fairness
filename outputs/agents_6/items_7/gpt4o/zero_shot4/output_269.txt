Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  26  86  35  36  67  52
1   3  31  61  41   3  86   2
2  50  86   3  64  55  80  90
3  54   4  89  11  60  34  74
4  39  48  94  39   6   9  79
5  50  49  94  16  50  69  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is reasonably balanced. Here's a possible allocation based on the valuations given:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocated items with relatively high value for them.
2. **Agent 1:** Allocated items where they have reasonable value.
3. **Agent 2:** Try to allocate items with high values.
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate items where they have reasonable value.
5. **Agent 4:** Assign items with higher value.
6. **Agent 5:** Allocate items with relatively high value.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (Value: 86)
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (Value: 86)
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 6 (Values: 86, 90)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (Value: 60)
- **Agent 4**: Item 3 (Value: 39)
- **Agent 5**: Item 0 (Value: 50)

This distribution ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
