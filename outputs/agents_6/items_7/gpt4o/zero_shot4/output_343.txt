Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  61  15  57  81  62  89
1  27  85  88  74  61   9  29
2  33  23  96  97   4  15  83
3  85   7  93  49  78  52  26
4  76  20  33   3  61  73  34
5  31  52  45  85  36  73   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes the total value perceived by them. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, each agent should ideally receive at least one item, but since there are fewer items than twice the number of agents, some agents might receive more than one item.

Let's consider the valuations of each agent for the items and aim to allocate the items in a balanced manner:

1. **Agent 0** values items 6 highly.
2. **Agent 1** values items 2 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 3 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values items 0 highly.
5. **Agent 4** values items 5 highly.
6. **Agent 5** values items 3 highly, but since it's already assigned, we look at the next best, item 5.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. Since item 5 is already assigned, assign item 1 to Agent 5.
7. Assign the remaining item 4 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 has the second-highest value for item 4).

Thus, we have allocated all items. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
