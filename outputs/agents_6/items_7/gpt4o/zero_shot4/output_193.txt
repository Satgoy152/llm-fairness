Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  63  48  68  45  42  92
1  99   1  16  55  86  34   5
2  11  91  84  54  43  35  84
3  11  23  35  55  84  84  73
4  19  16  68  36  37  28  38
5  28  62  64  66  73  22  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99  1 16 55 86 34  5]
 [11 91 84 54 43 35 84]

 [19 16 68 36 37 28 38]
 [28 62 64 66 73 22 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I aim to distribute them based on maximizing the total value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most.
- The remaining item 6 can be allocated to Agent 0, as it provides them with a high value.

This results in a fair distribution considering both the number of items and the valuation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
