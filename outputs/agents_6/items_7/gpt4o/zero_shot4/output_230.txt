Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  15  44  13  49  88  78
1  89  28  80  89  49  70  84
2  92  51  97  48  65  77  48
3  91  86  31  99  64  75  76
4  31  87  24  12  83  23  56
5  45  45  45  98  23  59   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that tries to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. We can use a simple greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. This approach will be fair in terms of maximizing the total value assigned to each agent.

Here's how this can be done:

1. For each item, identify which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure all items are allocated.

Let's apply this strategy to the given data:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 92 by Agent 2.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 87 by Agent 4.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 97 by Agent 2.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 99 by Agent 3.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 83 by Agent 4.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 88 by Agent 0.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 84 by Agent 1.

Now, let's allocate the items based on the above:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 5 gets no items.

The allocations can be represented in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": []
}
```
