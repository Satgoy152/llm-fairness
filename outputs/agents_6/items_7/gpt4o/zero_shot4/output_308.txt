Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  47  77  63  65  97  85
1  14  88  74  66  37  33   3
2  17  87  93  82  82   8  86
3  14  81  18  32  59  88  44
4   5  83  15  75   6  11   1
5   9  76  89  51  97  98  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Determine each agent's highest-valued item and allocate those items first, if possible without conflict.
2. Adjust and reallocate to ensure all items are distributed.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0: Prefers item 5 with a valuation of 97.
- Agent 1: Prefers item 1 with a valuation of 88.
- Agent 2: Prefers item 2 with a valuation of 93.
- Agent 3: Prefers item 5 with a valuation of 88 (but item 5 is already taken by Agent 0, so pick the next best available).
- Agent 4: Prefers item 1 with a valuation of 83 (but item 1 is already taken by Agent 1, so pick the next best available).
- Agent 5: Prefers item 5 with a valuation of 98 (but item 5 is already taken by Agent 0, so pick the next best available).

Resolving conflicts and reallocating:

- Agent 0 takes item 5.
- Agent 1 takes item 1.
- Agent 2 takes item 2.
- Agent 3 takes item 3.
- Agent 4 takes item 0.
- Agent 5 takes item 6.
- Item 4 is left unallocated, so assign it to the agent with the least total value, Agent 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, every item is allocated, and no item is allocated more than once.
