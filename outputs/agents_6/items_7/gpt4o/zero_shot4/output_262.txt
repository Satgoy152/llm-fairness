Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  72  69  98  76  56  67
1  75  30  33  82  46  96  74
2  56  49   3  35  57   9  96
3  50  34  64  91  50  82  37
4   4  38  19  95  25  61  44
5  77  38  72  97  27  42  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated. We also want each agent to get at least one item if possible. Here's a potential allocation that considers these factors:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item.
2. Ensure that every agent receives at least one item if feasible.

Let's follow these steps:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 98).
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 96).
- Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 96).
- Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 34).
- Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 25).
- Assign item 2 to agent 5 (value 72).
- Finally, assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 45) since they have the next highest valuation.

This ensures that each item is assigned to the agent that values it most highly, while attempting to distribute items fairly across agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
