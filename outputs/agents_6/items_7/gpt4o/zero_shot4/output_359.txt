Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  86  55   4  43  67  24
1  81  75  66  21  95  33  74
2  91  28  88  41  64  46  20
3  67  36   6  27   3  91  63
4  26  92  39  59  56  12  37
5  66  47   9  84  65  96  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a strategy that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item wherever possible. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. **Initial Allocation:** Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item is initially assigned to maximize its value.
3. **Adjust Allocations:** If any agent does not receive an item, consider reallocating items from agents with more than one item to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Now, let's perform this allocation based on the given valuations:

| Item | 0   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Agent| Valuation |
| 0    | 2   | 86 | 55 | 4  | 43 | 67 | 24 |
| 1    | 81  | 75 | 66 | 21 | 95 | 33 | 74 |
| 2    | 91  | 28 | 88 | 41 | 64 | 46 | 20 |
| 3    | 67  | 36 | 6  | 27 | 3  | 91 | 63 |
| 4    | 26  | 92 | 39 | 59 | 56 | 12 | 37 |
| 5    | 66  | 47 | 9  | 84 | 65 | 96 | 31 |

**Allocation Strategy:**
- **Item 0:** Agent 2 (valuation: 91)
- **Item 1:** Agent 4 (valuation: 92)
- **Item 2:** Agent 2 (valuation: 88) 
- **Item 3:** Agent 5 (valuation: 84)
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 (valuation: 95)
- **Item 5:** Agent 5 (valuation: 96)
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 (valuation: 74)

**Adjusting for Fairness:** Since some agents might not receive any items, we need to adjust:
- Agent 0 and Agent 3 currently have no items. We can consider reallocating some low-value items from agents with multiple items to these agents, especially from agents with less critical valuation differences.

**Revised Allocation:**
- **Agent 0:** Item 0 (from Agent 2, lower priority)
- **Agent 1:** Items 4, 6
- **Agent 2:** Item 2
- **Agent 3:** Item 3 (from Agent 5, lower priority)
- **Agent 4:** Item 1
- **Agent 5:** Item 5

This revised allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the item allocations are done considering the highest valuations possible while maintaining fairness.

**Final JSON Format Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```
