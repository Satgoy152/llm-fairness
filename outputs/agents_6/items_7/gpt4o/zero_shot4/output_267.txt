Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  15  42  88  97   3  74
1  70  70  21  73  19  88  66
2  37  98  25  49  73  14  34
3  96  81  43  14  12  89  62
4  76  28  48  16  45  27  11
5  96   6   3  19  94  53  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. An approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm where we iteratively assign items to the agent who values the item the most among the remaining unallocated items.

Let's go through the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most with 96.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most with 98.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most with 42.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most with 88.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most with 97.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most with 89.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most with 74.

After the initial allocation, items are distributed as follows:
- Agent 0: [2, 3, 4, 6]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0, 5]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: []

We need to adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is as fair as possible. Let's adjust the allocation to be fairer by considering the next highest preferences of agents with no items.

Revised allocation:
1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 (value 96)
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 (value 98)
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 (value 42)
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 (value 73)
5. **Item 4**: Agent 5 (value 94)
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 (value 27)
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 (value 74)

Here's the revised allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
