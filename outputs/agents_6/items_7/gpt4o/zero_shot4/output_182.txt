Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  69  80  19  23  88  99
1  47  46  95  61  78  59  82
2  72  11  58  96  41  37   0
3  56  24   1  69  53  89  54
4  90  80  60  61  59  96  70
5  73  63  37  35  26  76  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the matrix of valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each item:

1. Item 0 is most valued by agent 0 (value 94).
2. Item 1 is most valued by agent 4 (value 80).
3. Item 2 is most valued by agent 1 (value 95).
4. Item 3 is most valued by agent 2 (value 96).
5. Item 4 is most valued by agent 1 (value 78).
6. Item 5 is most valued by agent 4 (value 96).
7. Item 6 is most valued by agent 0 (value 99).

With these allocations, we try to ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 6
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 1 and 5
- Agent 5: No items

This allocation ensures that each agent's preferences are considered and the items are distributed fairly based on their values.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 5],
    "5": []
}
```
