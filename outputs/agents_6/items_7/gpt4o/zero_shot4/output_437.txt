Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  84  78  78  59  72  86
1  89  23  93  83  68  57  62
2  88  26  32   0  25  28  49
3  41   5  28  83  61  10  26
4  19  48   9  19  34  91  20
5  48  98  34  17  67  85  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 23 93 83 68 57 62]
 [88 26 32  0 25 28 49]
 [41  5 28 83 61 10 26]

 [48 98 34 17 67 85 84]]
Output:
To allocate the 7 items fairly among the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated. Each agent should ideally receive at least one item, but since we have more agents than items, some agents will end up with no items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 6 (86), 1 (84), 0 (81)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (93), 0 (89), 3 (83)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 0 (88), 6 (49), 1 (26)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 3 (83), 4 (61), 0 (41)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 5 (91), 1 (48), 4 (34)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (98), 5 (85), 4 (67)

After considering the valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: No items
- **Agent 3**: Item 3
- **Agent 4**: Item 5
- **Agent 5**: Items 4, 6

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed, some agents receive more based on their higher valuations, and every agent is represented in the allocation even if they receive no items.
