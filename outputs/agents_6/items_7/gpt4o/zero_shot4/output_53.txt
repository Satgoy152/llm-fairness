Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  67  73  12  85  49  86
1  90  89  17  57  81  70  61
2  68  48   3   1  86  34   1
3  22  96  12  58  66  50  43
4  65  11  56  86  78  58  53
5  35  89  83  25  47  94  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. To do this, we will prioritize allocating items based on the highest valuation by each agent, aiming to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction across all agents.

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: We will look at each agent's valuation of items and prioritize giving them the item they value the most, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.

2. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item**: We will repeat the process until all items are allocated, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust allocations if necessary**: If some agents do not receive any items, adjust the allocation to make sure each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (value 86), so we give them item 6.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (value 90), so we give them item 0.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (value 86), so we give them item 4.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (value 96), so we give them item 1.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (value 86), so we give them item 3.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (value 94), so we give them item 5.

Now, one item remains (item 2). We need to allocate it fairly:

- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 5 (value 83), but to ensure fairness and a balanced allocation, we will give it to an agent who values it reasonably high and hasn't already received an item they value exceptionally high. In this case, Agent 0 values item 2 at 73, which is a high valuation among the remaining options.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
