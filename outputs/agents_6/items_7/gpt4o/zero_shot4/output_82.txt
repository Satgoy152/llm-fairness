Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  60  34  51  95  30  51
1  43  55  95  86  84  47   7
2  25   8  70  40  79  29   1
3  37  19  52  18  99   0  82
4  86  10   5  62  25  53   7
5  71  95  48  45  10  36  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "maximum sum" method, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that the total utility (sum of values) is maximized.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 99 (highest value).
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 5 values it at 95 (highest value).
   - Assign to Agent 5.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 1 values it at 95 (highest value).
   - Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 1 values it at 86 (highest value).
   - Assign to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 3 values it at 99 (highest value).
   - Assign to Agent 3.

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 30 (highest value among unassigned agents).
   - Assign to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6:** 
   - Agent 3 values it at 82 (highest value).
   - Assign to Agent 3.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, while all items are allocated among the agents.
