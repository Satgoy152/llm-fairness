Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  89  21  19  70  46  30
1  71  64  84  12  87  27  31
2  88   3  50  96  99  13  71
3  85  43  15  40  51  65  15
4  63   6  50  40  96  87   5
5  97  39  25  35  71   0  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here’s one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for the items and start by assigning those items to the agents.
2. Continue assigning items based on the highest remaining valuations while ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.
3. Aim for a balanced distribution where each agent ends up with at least one item, if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Values highest for item 1 (89), assign item 1.
- Agent 1: Values highest for item 4 (87), assign item 4.
- Agent 2: Values highest for item 4 (99) but it’s already taken, next highest is item 3 (96), assign item 3.
- Agent 3: Values highest for item 0 (85), assign item 0.
- Agent 4: Values highest for item 4 (96) but it's already taken, next highest is item 5 (87), assign item 5.
- Agent 5: Values highest for item 0 (97) but it’s already taken, next highest is item 6 (73), assign item 6.

Now we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [6]

Currently, agent 2 has no items, and agent 2 originally valued item 2 at 50, which is the highest unallocated item valuation. Assign item 2 to agent 2.

Now all items are allocated, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
