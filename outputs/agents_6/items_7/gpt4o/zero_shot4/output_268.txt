Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  45  45   2  40   9  15
1  98  32  81  98  21  41  14
2  42  52  65  19  69  46   4
3  99  79  21  77  36  75  22
4  35   2   5  53  37  36  88
5  56  74  43  65  86  23   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed, we can try an approach that maximizes the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has moderate interest in items 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0 and 3, so these should be prioritized for them.
3. **Agent 2** has a balanced interest, but item 4 is valued more.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0, but since Agent 1 values it too, we will give them item 1, which is their next high-value item.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 the most.
6. **Agent 5** values item 4 the most, but since Agent 2 values it too, we'll allocate them item 1, which they also value highly.

Given these considerations, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2] (Item with moderate value)
- **Agent 1**: [0, 3] (Items with high value)
- **Agent 2**: [4] (Item with high value)
- **Agent 3**: [1] (Item with high value, after competing with Agent 1)
- **Agent 4**: [6] (Item with high value)
- **Agent 5**: [5] (Item with moderate value)

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents.
