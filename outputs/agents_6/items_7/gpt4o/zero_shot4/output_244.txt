Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  99  39  40  21  69  14
1  95  83  49  63  80  60  76
2  20  66  20  78  53  48  11
3  28  37  56  84   3  31  51
4  90  92  29  76   8  76  47
5  89  69   0   3  24  77  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we should try to assign items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's aim to maximize the sum of values for each agent where possible. Here’s one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 1 the highest at 99.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 0 is valued the highest by Agent 1 at 95.
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 3 the highest at 78.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4 is valued at 3, which is the lowest in the list.
5. **Agent 4**: They value item 5 at 76.
6. **Agent 5**: They value item 2 at 0, which is the lowest in the list.

Now, let's ensure that all 7 items are allocated and that no agent receives more than their share:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.
- Agent 5 gets item 4.

In this allocation, each agent receives one item except for Agent 5, who receives two items. Let's adjust:

- Agent 5 can take item 2, and we need to reassign item 4 to another agent.

Reassigning item 4 to Agent 3 (since it increases their total value by more), the allocation becomes:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets items 4 and 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.
- Agent 5 gets item 2.

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent gets some value. Here’s the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
