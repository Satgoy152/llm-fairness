Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  44  73  65  90  63  44
1  39  71  87  11  31  18  72
2  19  17   1  82  65   2  61
3  55  38  31  94   7  26  22
4  92  15  10  38  83  87  61
5  24  65   0  61  25  78   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 71 87 11 31 18 72]
 [19 17  1 82 65  2 61]

 [24 65  0 61 25 78  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. One common method is to use a greedy allocation strategy where we iteratively assign the item to the agent who values it the most and has not yet reached their allocation cap (in this case, each agent can get at least one item since there are 6 agents and 7 items).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 4 is most valued by Agent 0 with a value of 90.
2. Item 2 is most valued by Agent 1 with a value of 87.
3. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 3 with a value of 94.
4. Item 5 is most valued by Agent 4 with a value of 87.
5. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 4 with a value of 92.
6. Item 6 is most valued by Agent 1 with a value of 72.
7. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 with a value of 71.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and fairly balance the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 2, 6, and 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 0.
- Agent 5 gets item 5.

Agent 2 does not receive any items, but this allocation ensures that each agent has had the opportunity to receive the items they value the most according to the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 6, 1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
