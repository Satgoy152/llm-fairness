Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  67  17  70  82  85  89
1  79  70  21  48  36  86  60
2  72  39  87  75  47  42  16
3  90   9  55  66  59  61  49
4  28   2  15  35  69  28  80
5  69  73  60   2   8  13  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them so that each agent gets at least one item, and we consider the valuations to optimize the satisfaction. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 6 (value 89)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (value 79)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (value 87)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 0, but already taken. Next highest: Item 3 (value 66)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 6, but already taken. Next highest: Item 4 (value 69)

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (value 73)

This allocation gives each agent an item they value highly. Distribute the remaining items to balance the allocation and ensure each agent has at least one item:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 6

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Item 2

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Item 3

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Item 4

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Item 1, Item 5 (to ensure all items are allocated)

The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
