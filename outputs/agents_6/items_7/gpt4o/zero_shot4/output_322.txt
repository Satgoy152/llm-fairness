Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  17  68  91  75  38  25
1  68  40  57  96  60  30  60
2   6   1  25  76  93   2   4
3  16  23  37  41  98  15  83
4  41  13  37  76  97  87   4
5  18  48  76  95   4  14  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [ 6  1 25 76 93  2  4]

 [18 48 76 95  4 14 67]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while all 7 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy focusing on maximizing individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 3 (value 91)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 (value 57)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 93)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 6 (value 83)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5 (value 87)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 1 (value 48)
7. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 58)

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it highly, thus attempting to maximize the overall satisfaction. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and utilizes all 7 items.
