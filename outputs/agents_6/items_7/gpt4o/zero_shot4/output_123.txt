Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  27  23  58  50  19  43
1  40  20  68  75  78  84   7
2  79  55  36  90  14  26   8
3  29   6  25  65  25  24  40
4  34   0  34  36  92  38   2
5  39  21  91  29  59  76  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations of each agent for each item. One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: No items allocated, as they have relatively lower valuations compared to others.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 (highest valuation for agent 1 among available items).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (highest valuation for agent 2 among available items).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 (highest valuation for agent 3 among available items).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4 (highest valuation for agent 4 among available items).
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate items 0, 1, and 2 (highest valuations for agent 5 among available items).

The allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Below is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the satisfaction of each agent by ensuring they receive items with the highest possible valuations relative to other agents.
