Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  20  82  14  19  60   2
1  88   5  39  41  57  29  95
2  92  63  63  79  68  70  27
3  78  86  66  45  50  50  16
4  62  12  71  32  76  31  13
5  93  63  37  54  60  10  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to take into account the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Find a high-value allocation for each agent:**
   - We prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most, as long as it doesn't conflict with another allocation that would cause a significant drop in total satisfaction.

2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item:**
   - Since we have 7 items and 6 agents, at least one agent will receive two items.

3. **Allocate based on maximizing value:**
   - After each agent gets their top choice, we distribute the remaining items to ensure each agent gets an optimal or close-to-optimal allocation.

Given the valuation table, here's one way to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Valued item 2 the highest. Allocate item 2.
- **Agent 1**: Valued item 6 the highest. Allocate item 6.
- **Agent 2**: Valued item 0 the highest. Allocate item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Valued item 1 the highest. Allocate item 1.
- **Agent 4**: Valued item 4 the highest. Allocate item 4.
- **Agent 5**: Valued item 5 the highest. Allocate item 5.

This allocation leaves no item for agent 0, so we can consider reallocating:

- Reallocate item 3 (next highest for agent 0) to agent 0. 

Now, adjust allocations to ensure fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3]
- **Agent 1**: Items [6]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0]
- **Agent 3**: Items [1]
- **Agent 4**: Items [4]
- **Agent 5**: Items [2, 5] (since agent 5 values 2 and has room for two items)

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives their highest possible valued item given the constraints. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
