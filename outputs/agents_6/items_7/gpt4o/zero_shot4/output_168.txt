Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  33  90  20   3  33  68
1   7  50   2  42  57  79  40
2  56  19  14  56  19  13  64
3  69  97  74  77  65  18  85
4  37  32  37  95  23  19  37
5  71  96  22  76  46  94  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 50  2 42 57 79 40]
 [56 19 14 56 19 13 64]

 [71 96 22 76 46 94 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Given the table, we will attempt to allocate items such that the total perceived value is maximized across all agents. 

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 2 (value: 90)
   - Item 0 (value: 73)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 5 (value: 79)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 6 (value: 64)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 1 (value: 97)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Item 3 (value: 95)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Item 4 (value: 46)

This allocation ensures every item is assigned to one agent, and the allocation attempts to maximize the sum of the values. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint that each agent can receive an integer number of items, and all items are allocated to agents.
