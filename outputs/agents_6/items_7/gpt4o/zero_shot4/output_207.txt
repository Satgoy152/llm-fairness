Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  22  69  29  84  11  26
1   7   5  25  52  94  35  17
2  65  99  11  62  46  85  32
3  98  88  62  19  37  34  46
4  77  51  94  14  60  22  61
5  99  31  31  89  27  82  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and the allocations are made in a way that maximizes the agents' valuations. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item among all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible by reassigning the least valued item if necessary.

Using this method, here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

- Item 0: Agent 5 (value 99) 
- Item 1: Agent 2 (value 99)
- Item 2: Agent 4 (value 94)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 52)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (value 94)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (value 85)
- Item 6: Agent 5 (value 85)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item. Adjust the allocations if necessary while still trying to maximize valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 6

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6]
}
```
