Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  50  49  45  31  53  55
1  73  21  62   1  98  54  57
2  23  46   6  42  15  29   7
3  91  83  94  45  56  76  19
4  71   2  24  16   9  81  39
5  78  13  30  38  43  34  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items while distributing all 7 items. One potential approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent, ensuring every agent gets at least one item if possible, or balancing the overall satisfaction.

Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 the highest at 55.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the highest at 98.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 the highest at 46.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 the highest at 94.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 5 the highest at 81.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 0 the highest at 78.
7. Allocate any remaining items to agents who might need additional allocation or adjust based on fairness.

Given the above, here's a suggested allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3]
}
```

This allocation assigns each of the 7 items to agents based on their highest valuation for an item, aiming to maximize satisfaction for each agent.
