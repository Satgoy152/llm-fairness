Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  22  11  50  39  98  37
1  94  98  31  77  10  55  84
2  66  55  99  83  21  12   6
3  34  90  73  56  45  42  85
4   8  41  45  93  45  11  38
5  50  91  56  13  48  31  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the allocations consider the agents' preferences reflected in their valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and a total of 7 items are allocated.

Let's follow a strategy where we prioritize giving each agent the item they value the highest and then proceed to distribute the remaining items.

1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (98).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (98).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (99).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (90) but it's taken, so next highest is item 6 (85).
   - Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (93).
   - Agent 5 values item 1 the highest (91) but it's taken, so next highest is item 0 (50).

2. Assign items based on these preferences, ensuring no conflicts, and then allocate remaining items:
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 5.

3. Only item 4 remains unallocated. We check which agent has the next highest valuation for this item:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 39.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 10.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 at 21.
   - Agent 3 values item 4 at 45.
   - Agent 4 values item 4 at 45.
   - Agent 5 values item 4 at 48.

   Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 4 among those who have not been assigned their highest preference, so assign item 4 to Agent 5.

Finally, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```
