Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  18  70  22  46  19  47
1  49  73  91  65   4  44  89
2  80  13   7  35  65  39  71
3  69  66  92  24  73  43  32
4  78  33  43  56  20  19   0
5  55  62  22  34   3   7  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the allocation maximizes the total valuation for the agents. We can use a simple greedy algorithm where we assign items to the agent that values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 80, which is the highest among all agents, so assign it to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 73, which is the highest among all agents, so assign it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it at 92, which is the highest among all agents, so assign it to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 65, which is the highest among all agents, so assign it to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it at 73, which is the highest among all agents, so assign it to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it at 39, which is the highest among all agents, so assign it to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 89, which is the highest among all agents, so assign it to Agent 1.

Now let's ensure each agent has at least one item and that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: No items assigned, move Item 6 to Agent 0 to ensure they have at least one item.
- Agent 4 and Agent 5: Still have no items, reassign as needed to balance:
  - Assign Item 4 to Agent 4.
  - Assign Item 3 from Agent 1 to Agent 5.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.
