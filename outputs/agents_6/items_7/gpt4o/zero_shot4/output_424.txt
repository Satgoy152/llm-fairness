Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  59  22  77  30  30  52
1  13  25  83  58  71  27  91
2  61  98  55  55  92  25  93
3   8  69  86   6   2  89  23
4  54  69  12  55  80  95  31
5  67   1   8  57  90  90  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is relatively balanced. We will try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Let's evaluate the situation and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has moderate valuations across the items.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 and item 2.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1, item 4, and item 6.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 and item 5.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 5.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 4 and item 5.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Agent 0 receives item 3, which they value at 77.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, valued at 83, and item 6, valued at 91.
- Agent 2 receives item 4, valued at 92.
- Agent 3 receives item 5, valued at 89.
- Agent 4 receives item 1, valued at 69.
- Agent 5 receives item 0, valued at 67.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's how it looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```
