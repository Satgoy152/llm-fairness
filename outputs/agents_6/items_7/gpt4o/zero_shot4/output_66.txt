Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  57  84  32  83   8  20
1  66  47  97  84  81  99  35
2  57  76   3  84  33  28  19
3  14  62  38  88  79   4  24
4  21  30  14  88  31  99  28
5  76  70   6  50   0  93  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can follow a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one item each.

Let's assign the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for one item first, then allocate the remaining item to the agent who would benefit the most from an additional item.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 2 with a value of 84.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 5 with a value of 99.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 1 with a value of 76.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 3 with a value of 88.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 5, but it's already taken. Next highest value is for item 3, but it's also taken. Next is item 6 with a value of 28.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 0 with a value of 76.

Now all agents except one have one item. The remaining item is 4, and we look for the agent that would benefit the most from an additional item:
- Agent 0: Item 4 value is 83.
- Agent 1: Item 4 value is 81.
- Agent 2: Item 4 value is 33.
- Agent 3: Item 4 value is 79.
- Agent 4: Item 4 value is 31.
- Agent 5: Item 4 value is 0.

Agent 0 has the highest valuation for the remaining item 4, so it will be allocated to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```
