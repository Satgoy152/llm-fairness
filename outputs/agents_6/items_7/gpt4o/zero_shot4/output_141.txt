Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  38  53   9  17  61  22
1  61  91  97  59  36  23  76
2  33  58  79  50  10  42  44
3  24  96  51  66  59  51  18
4  23  18  96  90  34  37  87
5  37   3  76  32  59  28  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each. We need to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible, taking into account the valuations provided by each agent.

Let's consider a strategy where we try to allocate the items to the agents based on their highest valuations. We aim to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 5 (value: 61).
2. Agent 1 receives item 2 (value: 97).
3. Agent 2 receives item 6 (value: 44).
4. Agent 3 receives item 1 (value: 96).
5. Agent 4 receives item 3 (value: 90).
6. Agent 5 receives items 4 and 0 (values: 59 and 37).

This allocation gives each agent one item, except for agent 5, who receives two items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 0]
}
```
This allocation ensures that the total number of items allocated is 7, and each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations.
