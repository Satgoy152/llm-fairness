Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  28  78  25  26  90  47
1  56  57  86  23  22  84  54
2  16  21  50  70  89  51  30
3  19  21  92  43  72  64  91
4  85  48  45  30  15  81  94
5  49  44   7  92  65  47   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and a total of 7 items are allocated. A fair allocation could be determined by considering each agent's valuations and attempting to maximize the overall satisfaction. 

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value: 94).
2. Agent 1 gets item 2 (value: 86).
3. Agent 2 gets item 4 (value: 89).
4. Agent 3 gets item 6 (value: 91).
5. Agent 4 gets item 5 (value: 81).
6. Agent 5 gets item 3 (value: 92).
7. Agent 1 also gets item 1 (value: 57).

This allocation attempts to give each agent a high-value item they particularly value, based on the given valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```
