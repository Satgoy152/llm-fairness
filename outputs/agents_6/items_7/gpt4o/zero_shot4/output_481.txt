Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  99  51  88  52  57  25
1   2   7  22  39  86  71   5
2   8  50  24  71  22  96  56
3  63  98  36  46  59  35  22
4  49  54  58  16  92  31  98
5  83  96  88  35  54  46  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. We'll use a simple allocation strategy by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 5 values it the most with a value of 83.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 99.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 5 values it the most with a value of 88.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 71.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 92.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 96.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 98.

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust as needed while keeping the allocation fair:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: No item initially
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 5
- **Agent 3**: No item initially
- **Agent 4**: Items 4 and 6
- **Agent 5**: Items 0 and 2

Since agents 1 and 3 have no items, we need to adjust the allocation:

From the initial allocation above:
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because it has a relatively low value for Agent 0 (28) and less impact on overall fairness.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 has high valuation for several other items but was initially left out.

This provides each agent with at least one item while respecting their valuations as much as possible.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [2]
}
```
