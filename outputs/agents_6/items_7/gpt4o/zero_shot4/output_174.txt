Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  82  54  45  97  65  61
1  99  68  29   3  47  87  91
2  14  89  49  48  82   6  14
3  65  40  46  27  98  72  73
4  59   7  65  54  99  71  53
5  49  39  51  25   8  42  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to consider their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
2. Distribute any remaining items to agents who value them highly, but still maintain an integer distribution of items.

Let's proceed with this allocation based on the above steps:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 4 (97).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 0 (99).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 1 (89).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 4 (98), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 6 (73).
- Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 4 (99), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 3 (54).
- Agent 5: Highest valuation is for item 0 (49), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 2 (51).

Now, distribute the remaining items (3 and 5) based on the second highest valuation:

- Agent 0's second highest valuation is item 1 (82), but it's already taken. Next is item 5 (65).
- Agent 3 already has one item with high valuation, so we could consider another agent who values remaining items highly.

Let's evaluate again for fair distribution:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [2, 5]

This allocation ensures each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
