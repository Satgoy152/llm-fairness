Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  83  79  74  17  96  35
1  86  31  99  82  83   7  75
2   6  41  34  92  66  80   5
3  44  10   3  77  59  24  15
4  13  37  48  49  95  42  21
5  71  94  36  16  59   5  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim to distribute items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Evaluate the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate that item to the respective agent if possible.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than one item unless necessary.

Here's a potential fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 5 (96).
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2 (99).
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3 (92).
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0 (44).
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4 (95).
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 1 (94).
- Agent 5 can also take item 6 since it has a relatively high value for it compared to others.

So, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets items they value highly, maximizing fairness based on the given valuations.
