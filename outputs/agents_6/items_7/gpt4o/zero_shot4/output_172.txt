Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  86  40  90  83  64  44
1  22   9  52  61  51  77  90
2  87  77  51  86  56  82  55
3  71  55  93  56  38  52  85
4  54  62  60   2  51  36  42
5  49  67  20  26  50  54  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can follow a method that aims to distribute items in a way that maximizes the total utility for all agents. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each item among all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. If two agents value an item equally, choose one based on some tie-breaking rule (e.g., assign it to the agent with the least number of items so far).
4. Ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent is included in the result, even if they receive no items.

Here is one such allocation, based on these principles:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
- Agent 1 receives item 6, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 5, as they have the highest valuations for these items.
- Agent 3 receives item 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Agent 4 receives no items in this allocation.
- Agent 5 receives item 4, as they have the highest valuation for it. 

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents in a way that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction.
