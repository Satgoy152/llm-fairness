Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  12  45  12  15  46  77
1   3  56  60  15  35  18  36
2  69  18  88  64  40  87  29
3   0   0  49  43  95  27  53
4  77  64  29  24   8  34  21
5  31  80  55  45  92  10  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are assigned. We can use a greedy approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze the values:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 0 with 81.
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 5 with 80.
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 2 with 88.
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 2 with 64.
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 3 with 95.
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 2 with 87.
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 0 with 77.

We should also ensure that if possible, each agent gets at least one item. Let's distribute the items accordingly:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 5.
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
5. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
6. Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.
7. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.

After these assignments, Agent 5 and Agent 3 end up with one item each. Agents 0 and 2 have more than one item, but since these allocations maximize the total value for each agent, they are fairly distributed, given the condition.

Let's present this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1]
}
```
