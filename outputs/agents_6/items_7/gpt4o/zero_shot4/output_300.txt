Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  26   8   0  77  27  78
1  58  70  17  75  57  34  41
2  39  39  89  64  92  95   8
3  44  50  76  56  61  18   5
4  51  14   8  75  31  73  25
5  94  12  35  87  94  39  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total value while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, given there are 7 items and 6 agents. Below is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and try to allocate items to balance the total values fairly.

2. Assign the highest-valued items to the agents that value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is a possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

- Agent 0 has high value for item 6.
- Agent 1 has high value for item 3.
- Agent 2 has high value for items 4 and 5.
- Agent 3 has high value for item 2.
- Agent 4 has high value for item 0.
- Agent 5 has high value for item 1.

Using this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```
