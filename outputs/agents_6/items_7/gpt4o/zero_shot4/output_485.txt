Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  57  62  82  81  91  51
1  44   7  73  59  13  29   1
2  34  23  73  50  65   5  36
3  42  49  24  18  26  10  62
4  26  12  65  18  60  36  24
5  35  79  57  23   4  43   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation that tries to maximize fairness:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent places on any item.
2. Assign that item to the respective agent if it is not already taken.
3. Continue assigning remaining items to agents who value them the most until every item is allocated.

Following this strategy, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value item is 5 (value 91).
- Agent 1: Highest value item is 2 (value 73).
- Agent 2: Highest value item is 2 (value 73), but it's taken by Agent 1. Next highest is 4 (value 65).
- Agent 3: Highest value item is 6 (value 62).
- Agent 4: Highest value item is 2 (value 65), but it's taken by Agent 1. Next highest is 4 (value 60), but it's taken by Agent 2. Next highest is 5 (value 36).
- Agent 5: Highest value item is 1 (value 79).

Now, assigning the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 0 (value 90).
- Agent 1 can take item 3 (value 59).

This ensures each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

Note: There might be multiple ways to fairly allocate the items, and the allocation above is just one possible solution.
