Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  55  30   3  78  79  81
1  66  51  98  86  61  98  35
2  71  97   5  69  79  48  86
3  15  96  59  65  44  22  53
4  98  63  70  79  42  24   5
5  46  52  90  92  70  50  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 55 30  3 78 79 81]
 [66 51 98 86 61 98 35]
 [71 97  5 69 79 48 86]
 [15 96 59 65 44 22 53]
 [98 63 70 79 42 24  5]
 [46 52 90 92 70 50 52]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 6 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing the value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 6 (Value: 81)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 (Value: 98)
   - Item 5 (Value: 98)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 1 (Value: 97)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3 (Value: 65)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 0 (Value: 98)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Item 4 (Value: 70)

This allocation gives each agent an item and maximizes the total value based on the given table.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```
