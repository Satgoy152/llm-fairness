Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  42  10  84  63  36  89
1  63  52  49  75  36  80  79
2  10   5   2  70  53  93   4
3  17  33  21  65  77  53  11
4  64  95  59  14  58  74  88
5  60  11  83   6  68  61  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable allocation based on their valuations, maximizing the total satisfaction. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 4 (value = 64)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 4 (value = 95)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 5 (value = 83)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 (value = 84)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 3 (value = 77)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 2 (value = 93)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (value = 89)

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is fair and balanced, considering the constraint of integer allocation and maximizing value:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1
- Agent 5: Item 2

This allocation respects the constraints and distributes the items fairly based on valuations. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1],
    "5": [2]
}
```
