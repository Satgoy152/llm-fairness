Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  95   0  50  72  92  25
1  45  22  59  65   6  65  83
2  29  51  35  75  99  90  35
3  25  96  42  46  16  33  84
4  25  67  53  45  13  93  41
5  37  78  45  56  37  85  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation by assigning them their most valued items while considering the overall distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations provided and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 5. 
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 4 and 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 5 and 1.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 5.

To allocate fairly, one strategy would be to ensure each item goes to the agent with one of the highest valuations for that item, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 3).
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 3 (value 96).
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 1 (value 59).
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 2 (value 75).
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 2 (value 99).
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 92).
- **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 1 (value 83).

This allocation allows each item to be allocated to an agent that values it highly while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
