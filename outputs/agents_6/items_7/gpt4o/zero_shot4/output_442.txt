Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  80  19  15  53  21  71
1  62   4  60  61  63  48  87
2   7  31  69  52  24  52  13
3  74   1  25  55  69  63  92
4  40   0  67  76  34   7  86
5  47  10  32  49  33  93  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction or utility. This involves assigning items to agents based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the table and derive a fair allocation:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 15     | 80     | 19     | 15     | 53     | 21     | 71     |
| 1     | 62     | 4      | 60     | 61     | 63     | 48     | 87     |
| 2     | 7      | 31     | 69     | 52     | 24     | 52     | 13     |
| 3     | 74     | 1      | 25     | 55     | 69     | 63     | 92     |
| 4     | 40     | 0      | 67     | 76     | 34     | 7      | 86     |
| 5     | 47     | 10     | 32     | 49     | 33     | 93     | 43     |

To maximize fairness, let's allocate the items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that every item is allocated:

1. **Agent 0:** Item 1 (80)
2. **Agent 1:** Item 6 (87)
3. **Agent 2:** Item 2 (69)
4. **Agent 3:** Item 3 (55)
5. **Agent 4:** Item 4 (34)
6. **Agent 5:** Item 5 (93)

Now, we have allocated the highest valued items to each agent. We still have to allocate Item 0 to ensure all items are distributed:

- **Agent 3** is the next highest-valuing agent for Item 0, after already receiving an item. Assign Item 0 to **Agent 3** as well.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent gets at least their highest valued item possible.
