Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  75  37  62  83  22  15
1  55  77  44  23  15  49  54
2  72   9  84  39  78  42  61
3  47  66  58  34  70  47   0
4  55  71  34  99  58  68  68
5  46  70  38  94  13  56  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value derived by all agents, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. 

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible.
3. Adjust if necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's perform this allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 72.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 77.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the highest at 84.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the highest at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the highest at 83.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the highest at 68.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the highest at 61.

Assigned items:
- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 6
- Agent 3: No item assigned
- Agent 4: Items 3, 5
- Agent 5: No item assigned

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to an agent who values it highly, and all items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": []
}
```
