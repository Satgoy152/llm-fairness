Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  27  80  55  40  52  63
1  90  33  47   2   0  52  92
2  37  25  11   5  45  93  64
3  78  99  71  44  26  74   4
4  45   9  40  15  80  93  87
5  35  70  92  75   9  27  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent. We will assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Values = [21, 27, 80, 55, 40, 52, 63]
2. Agent 1: Values = [90, 33, 47, 2, 0, 52, 92]
3. Agent 2: Values = [37, 25, 11, 5, 45, 93, 64]
4. Agent 3: Values = [78, 99, 71, 44, 26, 74, 4]
5. Agent 4: Values = [45, 9, 40, 15, 80, 93, 87]
6. Agent 5: Values = [35, 70, 92, 75, 9, 27, 34]

Let's allocate items by selecting the highest available value for each agent sequentially until all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 80)
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 90)
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 93)
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 99)
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 80)
- Agent 5 gets item 3 (value 75)
- Agent 0 also gets item 6 (value 63) since it was the next highest available value for them.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
