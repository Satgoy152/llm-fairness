Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  62  24  17  52  67  41
1  43   8  95  70  90  63  36
2  24  73  68  95  16  56  96
3  40  51  13  18  65   7  53
4  84   6  19  44   4  82  22
5  94   1  33  52  17  49  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, and we have 7 items to allocate among 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 or 0 items. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has relatively higher valuation for item 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 highly.
6. **Agent 5**: Highly values item 3.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 6
- **Agent 3**: Item 4
- **Agent 4**: Item 0
- **Agent 5**: Item 3
- We'll give an extra item to the agent with the least overall valuation, which is Agent 1 (if we consider total values).

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```
