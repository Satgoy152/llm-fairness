Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  75  77   1  48  83  26
1  55  46  73  23  10  62  46
2  87  42  87  62  84   7  50
3  21   1  54  21  55   8  65
4  29  51   0  16  85  70  10
5  13  78  92  57  41   5  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and only a total of 7 items should be allocated, one possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the provided valuations:

1. Item 0: Valued highest by Agent 2 (87)
2. Item 1: Valued highest by Agent 5 (78)
3. Item 2: Valued highest by Agent 5 (92)
4. Item 3: Valued highest by Agent 2 (62)
5. Item 4: Valued highest by Agent 4 (85)
6. Item 5: Valued highest by Agent 0 (83)
7. Item 6: Valued highest by Agent 5 (98)

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is fair by considering the total number of items each agent receives. Agent 5 has been allocated three items, while others have fewer. We will need to balance this allocation better.

Reassign item 1 to Agent 0, who values it next highest (75), and item 3 to Agent 1, who values it next highest (23).

The revised allocation is:

- Item 0: Agent 2
- Item 1: Agent 0
- Item 2: Agent 5
- Item 3: Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 4
- Item 5: Agent 0
- Item 6: Agent 5

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly while distributing the items fairly.
