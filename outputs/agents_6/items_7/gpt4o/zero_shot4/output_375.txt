Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  65  80  69  65   9  78
1  33  17  48  32  19  56   1
2  82  19  13  79   3  20  48
3  79   0  15  44  64  70  84
4  16  35   9  39  44   8  82
5  54  86  41  64  82  90  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 19 13 79  3 20 48]

 [54 86 41 64 82 90 87]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we can look at maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll try to assign items such that the total value for each agent is balanced as much as possible, given that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 2 (Value: 80)
  - Item 6 (Value: 78)
- Agent 1:
  - Item 5 (Value: 56)
- Agent 2:
  - Item 3 (Value: 79)
- Agent 3:
  - Item 0 (Value: 79)
- Agent 4:
  - Item 4 (Value: 44)
- Agent 5:
  - Item 1 (Value: 86)

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
