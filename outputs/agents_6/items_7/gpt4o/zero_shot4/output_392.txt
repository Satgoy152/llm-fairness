Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  41  69   0  92  64  97
1  57  89  97  11  40  51  64
2  28  68  94  67  45  74  30
3  95   6  77   2  73  79  40
4  87  11  15  20  72   8  82
5  97  61  99  82  67  78  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 41 69  0 92 64 97]
 [57 89 97 11 40 51 64]
 [28 68 94 67 45 74 30]
 [95  6 77  2 73 79 40]
 [87 11 15 20 72  8 82]
 [97 61 99 82 67 78 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both the valuations provided by each agent and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each. 

Looking at the table, we aim to maximize the total valuation across all agents. One approach is to assign items based on the highest available valuation for each agent, ensuring no two agents claim the same item. Below is an allocation strategy that attempts to maximize fairness and total value:

1. Agent 0: Item 6 (value 97)
2. Agent 1: Item 2 (value 97)
3. Agent 2: Item 5 (value 74)
4. Agent 3: Item 0 (value 95)
5. Agent 4: Item 4 (value 72)
6. Agent 5: Items 1 and 3 (total value 61 + 82 = 143)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the total valuation balance. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
