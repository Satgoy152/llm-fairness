Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33   9  15  27  41  91  41
1  12  69  85  75  70  89  44
2  45   9  55  86  89  30  55
3  95  87  11  15  46  40  62
4  81  22  25  97  42  77  66
5  80  29  39  12  26  89  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that assigns items to agents based on maximizing the overall satisfaction or value. Here, we're going to use a simple allocation strategy that attempts to ensure that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 3 (95).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 3 (87).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 1 (85).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 4 (97).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 2 (89).

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 0 (91).

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest valuation by agent 4 (66).

Now, let's compile the allocations into the given JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": []
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, and all items are distributed, ensuring fairness and maximizing overall valuation satisfaction.
