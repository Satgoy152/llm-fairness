Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  30  21   1  69  65  83
1  28  29  89  67  59  75   5
2  73   5  17  53  70  21  49
3  22  20  53  33  44   5   8
4  63  78  32   4  89  49  11
5   6  57  69  30  52   1  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are distributed. We should also aim for a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations to attempt a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highest at 83.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highest at 89.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highest at 70.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highest at 53.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highest at 89.
- Agent 5 values item 2 highest at 69.

Since there are conflicts, we need to consider a distribution that maximizes overall valuation while ensuring fairness. We will attempt to allocate items such that the total valuation across all agents is maximized, and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (second highest valuation).
- Assign item 3 to agent 3 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 4 to agent 4 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 1 to agent 5 (second highest valuation).
- Assign item 5 to agent 5 (highest valuation).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```
