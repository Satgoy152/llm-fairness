Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  79  92  50  63  19  23
1  43  15  26  63  24  20  16
2  18  68  26  83  91  63  24
3   4   4  12  33  80  96  18
4  69  86  69  63  57  68  98
5  52  42  33  10  84  88  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value perceived by all agents. We aim to distribute the items so that each agent has at least one item if possible, and each item is assigned only once.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. First, assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for the items, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Then, ensure no item is left unallocated.

Following this strategy, here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 6.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Lastly, we allocate item 1 to an agent who values it relatively highly (Agent 4 in this case, as they are next in line for a high value).

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 6],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their valuations as closely as possible.
