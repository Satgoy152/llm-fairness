Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  17  97  48  14  30  67
1   7  41  10  83  37  39  23
2  76  97  29  49  73  51  35
3  78  26  36  68  42  82  51
4  95  62  88  46  95  72  81
5  59  15  79  34  95  91  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[59 17 97 48 14 30 67]
 [ 7 41 10 83 37 39 23]
 [76 97 29 49 73 51 35]
 [78 26 36 68 42 82 51]
 [95 62 88 46 95 72 81]
 [59 15 79 34 95 91 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. One approach is to maximize the total valuation by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items accordingly:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (95).
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (97).
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97).
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (83).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (95).
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (91).
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (67).

Now let's assign these items to the respective agents:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 6
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Item 5

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
