Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  29  18  53  42  89  75
1  37  64  64  92  90  30  49
2  58  48  51  55  13  87   9
3  96  78  60  37  26  38  19
4  20  40  62  67  75  61  65
5  42  15  76  57   1  24  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's assess the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for items 0 and 1.
5. **Agent 4** has a decent valuation for items 4 and 6.
6. **Agent 5** has a high valuation for item 2 and 6.

Given these insights, a possible allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (Value = 89)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4 (Values = 92, 90)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (Value = 51)
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1 (Values = 96, 78)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (Value = 65)
- Agent 5: No item allocated

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's how the allocation would look in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```
