Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  90  11  56  64  13  98
1  26   4  77  45  60  23  55
2  57  59  13  80  69  86  31
3  67  58  53  22  82  91  32
4  31  33  17  43  75  60  24
5  42  19  27  47  39   0   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 90 11 56 64 13 98]
 [26  4 77 45 60 23 55]
 [57 59 13 80 69 86 31]

 [42 19 27 47 39  0  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction. Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the highest at 98. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest at 77. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest at 86. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest, but it's already taken. Their next highest-valued item is item 4 at 82. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest, but it's already taken. Their next highest-valued item is item 5, but it's also taken. The next available highest-valued item is item 3 at 43. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken. Their next highest-valued item is item 0 at 42. Assign item 0 to Agent 5.

At this point, items 1 remains unallocated. We can assign it to an agent who values it decently but hasn't already received their top choice. Agent 0 values item 1 at 90. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
