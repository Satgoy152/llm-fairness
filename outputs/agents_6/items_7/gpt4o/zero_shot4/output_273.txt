Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37   0  84  59   3  24  32
1  73  29  78  88  98  16  71
2   0  38  60  80  85  10  14
3  49  44  87  61  69  30  12
4   7  76  87  94  71   1  26
5  60  21  17  47  47  67   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed. One common method is to aim for a balanced allocation where each agent gets a similar total valuation from their allocated items.

Let's analyze the problem and make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation item is 2 (value 84).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation item is 4 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation item is 4 (value 85).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation item is 2 (value 87).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation item is 3 (value 94).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation item is 5 (value 67).

Now, we'll try to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring that each item is allocated.

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0. (84)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1. (98)
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 4. (94)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 5. (67)
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 as they have a high valuation for this item. (71)
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3, as it has a moderate value for them. (49)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as it has a moderate value for them. (38)

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```
