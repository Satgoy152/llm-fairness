Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  22  99  37  35  12  98
1   1  24  21  94  51  94  31
2  80  32  55  78  48  85   9
3  33   9  53  64  95  85  14
4  23  67  45  18  28  83  85
5   9  69  19  68  37  41  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one item each.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (99), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 highly (94), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 highly (80), so assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly (95), so assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highly (85), so assign item 6 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 highly (69), so assign item 1 to agent 5.

After this initial allocation, each agent has one item, and only item 5 remains unallocated. We need to assign it to one of the agents. Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 5 (85), so we'll assign item 5 to agent 2.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```
