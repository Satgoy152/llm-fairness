Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  86  50  81  45  48  17
1  71   8   9  61  74   6  32
2  86  76  64  77  64  48  92
3  38  53  45  21  83   8  92
4  91  21  98  14  58  49  12
5  74  97  38  19  38  14  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to consider both the number of items each agent receives and their valuations for the items. A common method is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and that items are distributed to maximize the total valuation.

We'll proceed by selecting items for each agent based on their highest valuations for those items, ensuring every agent gets at least one item.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 4** is most valued by agent 3 (83).
2. **Item 6** is most valued by agent 3 (92), but to ensure fairness, we allocate it to agent 2 who also values it at 92.
3. **Item 2** is most valued by agent 4 (98).
4. **Item 1** is most valued by agent 5 (97).
5. **Item 5** is most valued by agent 0 (48).
6. **Item 3** is most valued by agent 0 (81).
7. **Item 0** is most valued by agent 4 (91), but since agent 4 already has an item, we allocate it to agent 2 who also values it at 86.

This ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total valuation is maximized.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
