Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  44  51  74  62  28  14
1  13  64  66  16  20   8  86
2  79  49  32  69  17  57  45
3  75  24  33  19  92  68  83
4   1  32  73  90  81  18  46
5  15   8  94  16  89  89  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction or valuation each agent receives from their assigned items. Here's a possible allocation strategy using the given valuations:

1. First, determine which items hold the highest value for each agent, while ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
2. Attempt to balance the distribution so each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Given the table, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 (value 74)
- Agent 1: Items 6 (value 86)
- Agent 2: Items 0 (value 79)
- Agent 3: Items 4 (value 92)
- Agent 4: Items 2 (value 73)
- Agent 5: Items 5 (value 89), 1 (value 8)

This allocation considers the highest available valuation for each agent and distributes all 7 items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5, 1]
}
```
