Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  71  82  52  68  63  20
1  79  73  50  65  12  48  47
2  44  55  61  61  85  86  57
3  79  35  31  45  21  12   5
4  60  25  85  81  37   7   6
5  88  84  33  71  83  94   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a greedy approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, and ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible. 

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 5 values this item the most with a value of 88.
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 5 values this item the most with a value of 84.
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values this item the most with a value of 82.
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 4 values this item the most with a value of 81.
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 2 values this item the most with a value of 85.
6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 5 values this item the most with a value of 94.
7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 2 values this item the most with a value of 57.

To ensure fairness, we will adjust the allocation slightly to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Already assigned item 2.
- **Agent 1**: Needs an item. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 4 has a high value for item 4 as well.
- **Agent 2**: Already assigned items 4 and 6.
- **Agent 3**: Needs an item. Assign item 3 to Agent 3 instead, as Agent 1 has item 4 available.
- **Agent 4**: Already assigned item 3.
- **Agent 5**: Already assigned items 0, 1, and 5.

Let's finalize the allocations considering the adjustments:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, except for Agent 4 who cannot be assigned due to maximizing values for others, and a fair distribution is maintained.
