Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  11  92  64  52  56   3
1  99   6  11  13  21  19  30
2  85  71  42  32  53  53  54
3  41  59  75   9  29  60  22
4  96  43  76  33   5  71  90
5  62  46  58  63  22  77  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the distribution:

1. Assign the highest-valued items to agents who value them most, while trying to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's analyze and allocate:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (92).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (99).
- Agent 2 values item 0 second highest (85) but already allocated to Agent 1.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highly (75) but already allocated to Agent 0.
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly (90).
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly (77).

Now let's allocate based on maximizing valuations:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 99).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 92).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4 (value 90).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 5 (value 77).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 (value 71).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (value 29).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 5 (value 63).

This distribution ensures each item is allocated and tries to maximize total value across the agents while giving each agent at least one item where possible.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```
