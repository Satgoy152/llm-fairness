Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  64  57  23  88  20  24
1  47  32  75  39   4  47  67
2  82  74  52  32  25  90  86
3  78  35  90  14  98   3  37
4  95  42  23  66  99  74  63
5  64  79   5  22  83  67  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction/valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. With this in mind, we can proceed with a heuristic approach to allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each item.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the distribution fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0 (value 83)
   - Item 4 (value 88)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 (value 75)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 5 (value 90)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3 (value 14)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Item 6 (value 63)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Item 1 (value 79)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated.
