Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  44  14  41  88  15  78
1  22   1  53  80  15  67  59
2   6  98  19  38  51  21  53
3  43  96  97  54   8  79  15
4  16  25  47  33  55  61  56
5  87  65  90   1  51  33  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, attempting to balance the number of items as evenly as possible, given there are 7 items and 6 agents.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 5 (value 87).
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 2 (value 98).
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 97).
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 1 (value 80).
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 88).
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 79).
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 78).

Now, we need to ensure that all agents are included, and no agent gets more than necessary while keeping the allocation fair. We can redistribute some items if necessary:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Item [2, 5]
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Item [0]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items distributed. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0]
}
```
