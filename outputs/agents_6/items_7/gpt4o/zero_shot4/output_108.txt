Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  94  33  74  58  70  53
1  59  84  29  83  92   8  96
2  59  40  22  97  42  86   2
3  18  32  44  25  50  99  50
4  76   8  78  23  63  83  94
5  99  93  39  93  84   2  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent has the opportunity to receive items based on their valuations, with the goal of maximizing overall satisfaction. Below is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 5 values item 0 highest, so we allocate item 0 to agent 5.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 highest, so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 3 values item 5 highest, so we allocate item 5 to agent 3.
4. Agent 2 values item 3 highest, so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
5. Agent 0 values item 1 highest, so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
6. Agent 4 values item 2 highest, so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.
7. The remaining item, 4, is allocated to an agent who has received fewer items or has a high valuation for it. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```
