Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7   0  33   1  87  28  98
1   5   0  98  22  31  26   5
2  25  88   1  22  81  37  17
3  87  73  89  93  12  31  10
4  35  54   5  63  61   2  92
5  40  34  99   8   7  52  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents with the given valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. This problem can be approached with a greedy method or an optimization algorithm, but here we'll use a simple heuristic to allocate items.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 6 (value 98).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 1 (value 88).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 3 (value 93).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 6 (value 92), but it's already taken, so we choose item 4 (value 61).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (value 99), but it's already taken, so we choose item 5 (value 52).

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated:

- Item 0 is still unallocated, and Agent 3 has the highest remaining interest in it (value 87).

Finally, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while keeping the allocation as fair as possible based on the available data.
