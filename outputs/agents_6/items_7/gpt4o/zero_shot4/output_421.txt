Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  10  44   3  39  39   6
1  61   3  36  90  16  62  62
2  24  45  43  75  26  45  27
3  11   2  86  98  68  51  45
4  18  11  51  62  69  94  35
5  85  80  72  93  16  13  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. This is not necessarily a straightforward task, as fairness can be interpreted in different ways. Here, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the overall distribution is as balanced as possible in terms of individual valuations.

Let's analyze the values and allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (44), but so does agent 3 (86). Agent 3, however, values item 3 the most (98).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (90).
3. Agent 2 has a relatively balanced valuation across items, with item 3 (75) being the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 (98) and item 2 (86) the most.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the most (94).
6. Agent 5 values item 0 (85) the most.

Based on these observations, let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (10) and Item 4 (39)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (90)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (27)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (86)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (94)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (85)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preference, while also attempting to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Now, presenting the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents and each agent receives at least one item.
