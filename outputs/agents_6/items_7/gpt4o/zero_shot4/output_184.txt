Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  93   1  81  41  82  77
1  45  54   2  97  27   0  27
2  92  26  60  95  37  55  65
3  74  60  41  61  85  74  94
4  32  35  79  51  49   4  26
5  38  66  90  84  56  19  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we can consider a form of round-robin or sequential allocation that takes into account each agent's highest valuation that hasn't already been assigned.

Let's go through a fair allocation process. We'll start by assigning the items based on the highest valuation available to any agent, then proceed to the next highest, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (93).
2. **Item 3**: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 1 (97).
3. **Item 0**: Next highest is by Agent 2 (92).
4. **Item 6**: Next highest is by Agent 3 (94).
5. **Item 2**: Highest left is by Agent 5 (90).
6. **Item 4**: Next highest is by Agent 3 (85).
7. **Item 5**: Highest remaining is by Agent 0 (82).

Now, we can represent these allocations in JSON format as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent, and the distribution aims to reflect the highest possible satisfaction based on the given valuations.
