Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  92  94  38  22  52  32
1   6  24  74  67  34  60  92
2  53  83   7  11  91  34  15
3  69   4   6  40  49   5  14
4   2  19  33  25  15  22  98
5  51  28  94  27  19  89  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 92 94 38 22 52 32]
 [ 6 24 74 67 34 60 92]
 [53 83  7 11 91 34 15]
 [69  4  6 40 49  5 14]
 [ 2 19 33 25 15 22 98]
 [51 28 94 27 19 89 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for each item and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction based on these valuations. One way to achieve this is by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is a possible allocation of the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values item 0 the most (value 69).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 the most (value 92).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 and Agent 5 both value item 2 the most (value 94), but since Agent 0 gets item 1, we can assign item 2 to Agent 5.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 the most (value 67).
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values item 4 the most (value 91).
- **Item 5**: Agent 5 values item 5 the most (value 89).
- **Item 6**: Agent 4 values item 6 the most (value 98).

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations, and each agent receives at least one item, with the items being allocated to the agent who values them the most.
