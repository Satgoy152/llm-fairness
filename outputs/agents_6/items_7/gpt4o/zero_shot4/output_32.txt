Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  63  24  12  24  33  51
1  20  87  95  54  89  49  78
2  77  35  32  13  73   3  68
3  41  93  51  73  22  10  76
4  45  86  39  88  60  32  26
5  71  21  67  32  35  15  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 6 agents, we can use a strategy that considers each agent's highest valuation for the items. Our goal is to distribute all 7 items among the agents in a way that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 with a value of 77
   - Item 1: Agent 3 with a value of 93
   - Item 2: Agent 1 with a value of 95
   - Item 3: Agent 4 with a value of 88
   - Item 4: Agent 1 with a value of 89
   - Item 5: Agent 0 with a value of 33
   - Item 6: Agent 1 with a value of 78

2. **Assign items based on highest valuation**:
   - Initially assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item or none if that maximizes fairness**:
   - We need to ensure no agent receives all the items, and the distribution is relatively fair.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 33)
- Agent 1 gets items 2, 4, and 6 (values 95, 89, and 78)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 77)
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 93)
- Agent 4 gets item 3 (value 88)
- Agent 5 gets no items

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, without exceeding the total number of items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": []
}
```
