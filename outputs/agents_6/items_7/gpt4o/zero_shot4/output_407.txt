Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  26   7  54   5  91  25
1  87  64  53  62  55  42  19
2  57  24  72  45  25  91  53
3  17  73  44  68  78  36  49
4  47  24  96  97  53  31  45
5  38  32  63  42  16  96  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their individual valuations, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will end up with two items.

Let's start the allocation process by evaluating the highest preference for each agent and then proceed with optimal allocations. We aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent within this constraint.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 5 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 0 (value 87).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 5 (value 91), but it's already taken, so the next highest is item 2 (value 72).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 4 (value 78).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 3 (value 97).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 5 (value 96), but it's already taken, so the next highest is item 6 (value 81).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items, ensuring every agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than two.

### Remaining Items:
- Items 1 is not yet allocated.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (already allocated)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (already allocated)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (already allocated)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (already allocated)
- **Agent 4**: Item 3 (already allocated)
- **Agent 5**: Item 6 (already allocated)

### Allocation of Remaining Item:
- Agent 0 can take item 1 (value 26).

Here's the optimal allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, with one agent receiving two items.
