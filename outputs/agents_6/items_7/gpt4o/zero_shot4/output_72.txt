Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  48  48  63  27  50  15
1  63  88  82  67  39  25  69
2  27  46   9  64  31  38  46
3  54  41  87   1  18  45  46
4   7  18  28  76  16  96  41
5  49  42  95  25  16  87  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations and aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items valued highly by them. We'll also ensure that every item is allocated to exactly one agent and that each agent is included in the allocation, even if they receive no items.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 1** highly values items 1 and 2.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 2.
3. **Agent 5** highly values items 2 and 5.
4. **Agent 4** highly values item 5.
5. **Agent 0** highly values items 3 and 5.
6. **Agent 2** doesn't have very high valuations but values item 3 relatively more than others.
7. **Agent 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5** have varying valuations for the remaining items.

Allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to agent 5 (second highest valuation).
- Assign item 5 to agent 4 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (second highest valuation).
- Assign item 4 to agent 3 (relatively higher valuation).
- Assign item 6 to agent 2 (relatively higher valuation).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent is considered, and all items are allocated fairly based on their valuations.
