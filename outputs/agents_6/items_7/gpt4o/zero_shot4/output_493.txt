Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  78  28  63  84  51  76
1  63  22  91  58  20  25  44
2  67  15  23   0  93  89  16
3  29  65  32  37  54  23  99
4  65  31  69  16  63  34  26
5  20  77  68   2  19  96  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value obtained by each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. One common approach in this type of problem is to use a "maximum weight matching" algorithm or a "greedy allocation" strategy. Here, I'll use a simple greedy strategy to allocate the items to maximize individual agent satisfaction, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 4 to agent 2 because agent 2 values item 4 the most (93).
2. Allocate item 5 to agent 5 because agent 5 values item 5 the most (96).
3. Allocate item 6 to agent 3 because agent 3 values item 6 the most (99).
4. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 because agent 1 values item 2 the most (91).
5. Allocate item 1 to agent 0 because agent 0 values item 1 the most (78).
6. Allocate item 0 to agent 4 because agent 4 values item 0 the most (65).
7. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 because agent 0 still has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (63).

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent with the items they receive.
