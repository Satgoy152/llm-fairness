Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  83  98  29  23  15  37
1  81  64   7  62  84  21  13
2  13  67  14   6  20  50  24
3  25  84  80  84  84  77  90
4  31  10  85  33  83  98  37
5   3  34  99  33  28  45  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider maximizing the overall satisfaction, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and that the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on maximizing individual agent values.
2. Ensure no agent receives more than their fair share unless it's unavoidable.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (98).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (84).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (50).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (90).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest, but it's taken, so the next highest is item 2 (85).
- Agent 5 values item 2 the highest, but it's taken, so the next highest is item 0 (3).

Now, we'll check if any unallocated items can be assigned to maximize fairness:

- Items left: 1, 3
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly (84).
- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (83).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to maximize the overall happiness of all agents given the constraints.
