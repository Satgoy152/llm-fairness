Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  78  92  78   6  15  66
1  90  39  69  42  26   0  24
2  52  35  59   9  71  23  16
3  31  65  31  23  89  87  73
4  88  35   4  77  48  28  99
5  95  83  79  78  23  44  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) or ensure a balanced distribution, depending on the criteria for fairness you want to apply. Here, I'll attempt a distribution that considers maximizing valuations while ensuring each agent has at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (value = 92)
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (value = 90)
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (value = 71)
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (value = 87)
- Agent 4 gets item 6 (value = 99)
- Agent 5 gets item 1 (value = 83) and item 3 (value = 78)

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation and ensures each agent has at least one item, except agent 0 who gets none because the allocation provides a better overall value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among agents, with a focus on maximizing satisfaction based on given valuations.
