Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  59  52  88  93  48  39
1  33  69  53  84  98  40  58
2  40  88  56   9  39  50   6
3  91  71  86  48   6  50  32
4  22  50  91  91  30  46  31
5  37   6  68  88  74  15  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value received by each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest values are for items 4 (93) and 3 (88).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest value is for item 4 (98), but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest is item 3 (84).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest value is for item 1 (88).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Highest value is for item 0 (91).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:  
   - Highest values are for items 2 (91) and 3 (91), but item 3 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:  
   - Highest value is for item 3 (88), but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest is item 2 (68), but it's already allocated.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

7. **Unallocated Item**:  
   - The only item left is item 6.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 as they have the next highest valuation (39) for an unallocated item.

After validating that all items have been allocated, the final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```
