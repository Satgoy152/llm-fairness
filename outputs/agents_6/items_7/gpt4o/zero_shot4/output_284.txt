Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  89  83  55  50  58  44
1  39  68  23  90  89  40  20
2  18  29  91  43  67  93   0
3  85  28  21  95   6  85  15
4  73  71  30  24  45  78  63
5  39  87  99  20  74  44  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. Since each agent's valuation of each item is provided, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 2 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 2 and 5 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 0 and 3 highly.
- Agent 4 values items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 5 values items 1 and 5 highly.

After considering the highest values for each agent and ensuring all items are allocated, we can distribute the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item where possible, while trying to respect each agent's highest item values.
