Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  79  95  58  76  41  79
1  55  37  63  35  52  18  86
2   9  71  71  88  52  95  46
3  76  95  70  95  62  33  20
4  61  87   6  19  31  37  60
5  70  27  50  53  11  54  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all 7 items are distributed. We should also consider that each agent can receive an integer number of items, and some agents may not receive any items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning items with the highest valuation for each agent, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

2. Ensure all items are allocated, even if it means assigning an item to an agent with a lower valuation to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (value 95), Item 6 (value 79)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (value 35)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (value 95)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (value 95)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (value 61)
- Agent 5: Item 4 (value 11)

This allocation fairly distributes the items, considering the highest valuations and ensuring all items are allocated.

    "5": [4]
}
```
