Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  26  35  89  79  74  50
1  32  15  46  36  52  53  93
2  61  90  77  90  98  35  84
3  11  16  67  62  41  49  72
4  86  49  79  26  37   9  80
5  79  99  34  32  87  66  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the preferences and valuations of each agent for the items. In this context, a "fair" allocation could mean that each agent receives items such that their total valuation is as balanced as possible. Let's attempt to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent to achieve a fair distribution.

Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (value 89)
- **Agent 1**: Item 6 (value 93)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 98)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value 67)
- **Agent 4**: Item 0 (value 86)
- **Agent 5**: Item 1 (value 99)
- Remaining item needs to be allocated to keep the allocation fair.

Now let's ensure all items are allocated and no agent gets more than one item, except if necessary for balancing:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 6
- **Agent 2**: Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Items 0
- **Agent 5**: Items 1, 5

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents. The allocation is balanced to the extent possible by maximizing each agent's most valued item, while keeping the distribution fair.
