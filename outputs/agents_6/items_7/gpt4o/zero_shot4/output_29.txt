Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  35  70  55  86  34  49
1  10  97  69  88  90  71  98
2  46  57  18  50  83  55  17
3  74  84  79  23   6  27  34
4  15  59  98  50  13  98  65
5  51  55  97  98  60  18  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple strategy that aims to maximize total satisfaction by assigning items to the agents that value them the most. However, since each agent must receive an integer number of items and a total of 7 items must be allocated, we need to ensure that no agent gets more than one item than another unless it's unavoidable due to the number of items.

Let's proceed by examining the highest valuations for each item and assigning accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (74).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (97).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (98).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 5 (98).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (90), but since Agent 1 already has item 1, we give it to the next highest, Agent 0 (86).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (98), but since Agent 4 already has item 2, we give it to the next highest, Agent 1 (71).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98), but since Agent 1 already has items 1 and 5, we give it to the next highest, Agent 0 (49).

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 2: Items []
- Agent 3: Items [0]
- Agent 4: Items [2]
- Agent 5: Items [3]

So, the JSON representation of the allocations is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
