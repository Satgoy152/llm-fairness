Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56   0  15  45  88  59  93
1  36  37  98  25  42  42  11
2  98  54  52  89  81  97  60
3  89  61  64  33  24  58  79
4  43  55  72  25  34  38  82
5  82  44  50  51  79  13  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed, we can follow a strategy to maximize fairness. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the table and allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest with 98.
   
2. **Item 1**:
   - No agent values item 1 highly, but agent 4 values it at 55, which is the highest.
   
3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest with 98.
   
4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest with 89.
   
5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest with 88.
   
6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest with 97.
   
7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest with 93.

Now, let's represent these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": []
}
```

Here, each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and the items are fairly distributed among the agents.
