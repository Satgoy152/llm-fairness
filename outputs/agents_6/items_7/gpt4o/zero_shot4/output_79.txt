Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  56  82  85   1  13  52
1  51  94  78  45   3  11  48
2  56  30  47  92   9  19  29
3  37  55  66  24  96  53  91
4  78  37  80  61  71  86  97
5  15  90  11  75  61  73   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we'll try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one approach to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item.
2. Balance the distribution so that every agent gets at least one item before others receive additional items.

Let's work through the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most at 78.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 82.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 92.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 96.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most at 86.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most at 97.

Now, let's make sure every agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Items 0, 5, 6 (Since Agent 4 initially had a high valuation for three items and others were distributed, this balances the distribution by giving Agent 4 multiple items due to their high valuations.)

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 5, 6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on valuations and that each agent gets an integer number of items.
