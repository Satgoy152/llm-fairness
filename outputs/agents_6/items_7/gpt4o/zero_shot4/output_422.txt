Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  37  70  82  37  51   0
1  30  11  45  78  96  29   3
2  23  69  67  53  48  39  57
3  77  27  64  75  86  83  21
4  36  77  59  13  16  92  34
5  26  20  63  21  20  38  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy approach where we assign items to the agents who value them the most. This approach ensures that the total value of items received by each agent is maximized based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. List all items and their associated values per agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure that every agent receives at least one item if possible, but since there are more agents than items, not all agents will receive an item.

Following these steps, here's a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (77).
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most (77).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (70).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (82).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most (92).
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (96).

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are allocated. Note that agents 2 and 3 receive no items, which is a result of having more agents than items.
