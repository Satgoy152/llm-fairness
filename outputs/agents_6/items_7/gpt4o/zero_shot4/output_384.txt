Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80   0  43  46  44  68  85
1  59  93  39  47  10  33  95
2  14  85  35  25  46   9   3
3  85  52  92  75  77  75  24
4   3  17  65  87   3   9  39
5  37  30  67  26  58  88   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item if possible, the allocation is balanced, and the total number of allocated items equals 7.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values item 6.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 1, but agent 1 values it more; agent 2 can get item 4.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2.
- Agent 4 highly values item 3.
- Agent 5 highly values item 5.
- The remaining item (item 0) can be allocated to agent 0, who values it highly.

Based on this distribution, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
