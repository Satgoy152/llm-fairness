Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66   8  29  75  42  26  27
1  91  94  95  80  75  20  64
2  56  48   8  51  44  62  13
3   8  39  70  10   3  32  67
4   8  60  38  43  93  88   0
5  34  22  14  91  13  40  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that assigns items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent. Here's one possible allocation:

- Start by sorting the items for each agent by their valuation.
- Assign items to the agents while trying to maximize each agent's total value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (75), so assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (95), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most (62), so assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 the most (67), so assign item 6 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the most (93), so assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the most (91), but it's already taken, so assign item 0 to agent 5 as it's the next highest (34).

Now, we still have item 1 left to allocate. Let's check who values it the most among the agents who can still receive another item:

- Agent 0 has taken item 3.
- Agent 1 has taken item 2.
- Agent 2 has taken item 5.
- Agent 3 has taken item 6.
- Agent 4 has taken item 4.
- Agent 5 has taken item 0.

Agent 4 values item 1 the most (60) among the remaining options, so assign item 1 to agent 4.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
