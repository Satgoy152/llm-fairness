Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95   6  33  73  80  75  51
1  80  25  13  85  31  58  74
2  59  21  81  94  86  21   3
3  31  70  76  37  35  75  43
4  21  74  19   4  48  49  18
5  20  18  96  60  40  70  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is assigned. One common approach is to use the "max-sum" allocation method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This is a simple approach and won't always ensure the absolute fairest distribution in all contexts, but it provides a straightforward allocation.

Let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most at 74.
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most at 96.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 94.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 75.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most at 85.

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while each agent receives an integer number of items.
