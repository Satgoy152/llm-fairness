Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  10  37  44  71  29  16
1  84  47  33  17  83  76  58
2  91  93  42   7  75   4  97
3  19  52  77  35  37  12  50
4  11   5  16   6  55  53  70
5  29  22  54  65  47  79  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by considering each agent's highest-valued items. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring that all items are allocated. There are 7 items and 6 agents, so one agent will get 2 items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 with value 71.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 with value 84.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 6 with value 97.
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 with value 77.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value: Item 6 with value 70, but already taken.
   - Next highest value: Item 5 with value 53.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest value: Item 6 with value 99, but already taken.
   - Next highest value: Item 5 with value 79, but already taken.
   - Next highest value: Item 3 with value 65.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 5.

7. We have one item left to allocate (Item 1). We will allocate this to the agent who values it most and hasn't already received an item:
   - Agent 2 values Item 1 the highest with value 93.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```
