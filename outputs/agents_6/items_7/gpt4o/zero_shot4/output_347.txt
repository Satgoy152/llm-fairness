Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  31  94  36  68  92  65
1  48  31  39  30  43  85   9
2  45  49  94  60  46   6  20
3  96  58  96  99  27  47  87
4  82  95  98   4  48  44  33
5  49  78  80   9  42  32  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48 31 39 30 43 85  9]
 [45 49 94 60 46  6 20]
 [96 58 96 99 27 47 87]
 [82 95 98  4 48 44 33]
 [49 78 80  9 42 32 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences. One way to approach this is to use a variant of the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, where agents are matched to items based on the highest available valuation.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 99).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 94).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 48).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 95).
5. Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 96).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 85).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 5 (value 96).

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation for the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents while maximizing their total utility based on the table provided.
