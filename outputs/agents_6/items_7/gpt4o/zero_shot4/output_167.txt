Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  34  18  65  31  50  81
1  66  22  41  22  83  13  11
2   4  22  19  31  52   8  64
3  54  99  11  12  47   7  38
4  86  80  31  99  33  61  58
5  65  37  55  52  74  22  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Try to allocate items such that agents get items they value highly without leaving any items unallocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 already has high value for items 0, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4.
- Agent 3 highly values item 1.
- Agent 4 highly values item 3.
- Agent 5 can get item 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```
