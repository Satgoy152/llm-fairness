Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  41  18  30  95  80  18
1  45  38  43   9  47   8  96
2  87  70  18   7   6  28  49
3  82  14  14  59  83  13  62
4   5   9  21  90  35  38  94
5  59  24  24  75  65  39  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the 7 items such that each agent's allocation maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [4, 5] - This allocation gives Agent 0 the items with the highest value for them.
2. **Agent 1**: Item [6] - This item has the highest value for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Item [0] - This item has a high value for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Item [3] - This item has a high value for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Item [2] - This item has a reasonable value for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Item [1] - This item has a higher value for Agent 5 compared to others.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all 7 items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
