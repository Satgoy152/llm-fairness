Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  86  10   5  59  88  70
1  29  46  93  18  20  24  39
2  39  68  53  23  44  74  43
3  24  54  69  74  38  27  17
4  23  57  79  31  29  82  23
5  89  12   2  93  61  75  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and only 7 items are allocated in total. Here's one way to approach this allocation problem:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Look at the valuations to identify which items are most valuable to each agent.
2. **Prioritize Allocations**: Assign items to agents where the difference in value compared to other agents is highest, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Let's analyze the table and make an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value item is item 5 (value 88).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value item is item 2 (value 93).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value item is item 5 (value 74), but since Agent 0 also values this highly, we look for the next best option. Item 1 with value 68 is a good choice.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value item is item 3 (value 74).
- **Agent 4**: Highest value item is item 5 (value 82), but since Agent 0 also values this highly, we look for the next best option. Item 2 with value 79 is a good choice.
- **Agent 5**: Highest value item is item 3 (value 93), but since Agent 3 also values this highly, we look for the next best option. Item 0 with value 89 is a good choice.

With these considerations, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: [5]
- **Agent 1**: [2]
- **Agent 2**: [1]
- **Agent 3**: [3]
- **Agent 4**: [6] (next highest value item)
- **Agent 5**: [0, 4] (since Agent 5 has no other items and the value for item 4 is decent)

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```
