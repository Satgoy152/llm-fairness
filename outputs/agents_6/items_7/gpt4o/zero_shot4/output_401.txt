Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  41  27  35  70  41  71
1  88  34   5  14   6   4  18
2  30  93  41  39  59  48  55
3  88  47  78  23  82   6  74
4  34  33  77  55  79  23  93
5  31  61  33  41  29  80   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 highly as well, but not as much as agent 0; however, they can benefit from item 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 5 highly.

Thus, we allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items [0].
- Agent 1 gets items [3].
- Agent 2 gets items [1].
- Agent 3 gets items [4].
- Agent 4 gets items [6].
- Agent 5 gets items [2, 5].

Now, we present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
