Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  83  42  92  72  14  84
1  38  63  13  42  97  71   4
2  97  11  43  31  47  92  89
3  32  75  64  48  45  76  21
4  89  75  93  22  37  68  96
5  94  10  71  47  29  58  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Given the constraints, an appropriate allocation strategy is to assign items based on maximizing each agent's individual value for an item, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 3 (92).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (97).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (97).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most (75).
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most (93).
6. Agent 5 values item 5 the most (58).

The last item, item 6, will be allocated to the agent with the next highest valuation for it, which is agent 4 with a valuation of 96.

Based on this analysis, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly based on the agents' valuations.
