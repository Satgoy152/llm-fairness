Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  37  31  66  80  97  81
1  71  36  76  87  69  60  99
2  55  62  71  89  96  74  73
3  54  44  60  13  77  72  10
4   1  76  70  50  98  53  27
5  24  71  57   5  90  22  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 37 31 66 80 97 81]
 [71 36 76 87 69 60 99]
 [55 62 71 89 96 74 73]
 [54 44 60 13 77 72 10]
 [ 1 76 70 50 98 53 27]
 [24 71 57  5 90 22 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated equals the number of items available. Given the valuations, we can aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation across all agents.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, since there are more items than agents.
3. Allocate the remaining items to the agents, trying to maximize their valuation.

Following these steps, we can derive a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 97)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (value 99)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (value 96)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 13)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (value 76)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (value 24) and Item 2 (value 57)

Thus, all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. The allocations can be represented in the specified JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```
