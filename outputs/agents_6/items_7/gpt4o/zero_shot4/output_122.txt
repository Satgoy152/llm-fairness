Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  24  86  78  72  22  98
1   4  58  39  92  37  25   6
2  13  70  53  38   2  75  97
3  60  31  49  15   6  65  20
4  40  49  31  92  67  84  62
5  71  60  92  21  98  54  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a distribution that maximizes the value each agent receives based on their individual preferences. The goal is to assign the items so that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and the overall allocation is fair based on the given valuations.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 6 (value 98).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 3 (value 92).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 6, but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 5 (value 75).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 0 (value 60).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 3, but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 5, but it's already assigned. Next is item 1 (value 49).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation is for item 4 (value 98).

Now, let's check the remaining items:

- Items 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are allocated.
- Item 2 is unallocated.

To ensure that all items are allocated, we need to assign item 2:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 6.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 5.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 0.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 5**: Has item 4; can take item 2 as well since they have a high value for it (value 92).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items according to a fair valuation strategy, with some agents receiving more items due to overlapping high valuations.
