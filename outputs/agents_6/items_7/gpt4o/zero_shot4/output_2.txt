Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  94  22  57  77  44  80
1  25   8  95  33  83  59  55
2  36  42  93  70  70  69  81
3  60  18   5  96  97   8  56
4  88  73  36  55  69  22   7
5  60  10  56  21  43  42  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Let's work out the allocations based on the given valuations:

1. Assign the highest available valued item to each agent that hasn't received an item yet.
2. Continue assigning items to agents to maximize their valuation until all items are distributed.

Let's go through the process:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 1 (value 94).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 2 (value 95).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 2 (value 93) but it's already taken, so next highest is 6 (value 81).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 4 (value 97).
- **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 0 (value 88).
- **Agent 5**: Highest value item is 0 (value 60) but it's already taken, so next highest is 6 (value 57) but it's already taken, so the next highest is 2 (value 56) but it's already taken, so next highest is 3 (value 21).

Now, all agents have at least one item. Let's distribute the remaining unallocated items to maximize value:

- Item 3 is unallocated: Assign to Agent 3 (second highest value 96), but since 3 is already taken, assign to Agent 5 (value 21).
- Item 5 is unallocated: Assign to Agent 1 (value 59).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```
