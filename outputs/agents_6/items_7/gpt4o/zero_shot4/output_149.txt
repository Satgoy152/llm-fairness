Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  60  22  28  22  37   9
1  26   1  10  35  11  52  24
2  49  53  84  38  23  23  43
3  74  54  48  85  66  28  58
4  17  32  83  60  80  33  19
5  85  25  38  51  26  32  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we should consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to maximize overall satisfaction. We also have to ensure that each agent receives at least one item or none, with a total of exactly 7 items allocated.

To achieve this, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: By examining each agent's row, we can identify which items each agent values the most.
2. **Assign items to agents based on highest valuation**: Allocate items to agents who value them the most while ensuring all items are allocated.
3. **Adjust allocations to ensure fairness**: Balance the allocations so that no agent is significantly disadvantaged.

Let's assign the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most.

With these assignments, each agent gets one item, and every item is allocated. However, we still have one item left to allocate, which is item 6.

Since item 6 has relatively high valuations from agents 2 and 5, we can assign it to agent 5, who values it significantly (84), ensuring a better overall satisfaction for this agent.

Now, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations and that all 7 items are allocated.
