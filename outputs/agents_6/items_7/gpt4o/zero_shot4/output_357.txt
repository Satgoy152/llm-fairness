Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  75  43  69  62  55  10
1  93  91  68  22  75  83  18
2  28  64  46  15  89  19  96
3  13  94  40  41  83  64  93
4   4   1  52  26  85  16  60
5  14  96  92  96  70  49  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total utility while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each.

Let's proceed with an allocation that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 5 because agent 5 highly values item 1 (96).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1 because agent 1 highly values item 0 (93).
3. Assign item 6 to agent 2 because agent 2 highly values item 6 (96).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 5 as a second item because agent 5 values item 3 (96).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3 because agent 3 values item 4 (83).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1 because agent 1 values item 5 (83).
7. Assign item 2 to agent 0 because agent 0 values item 2 (43).

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```
