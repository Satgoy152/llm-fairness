Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  16  65  47  57  31  23
1  98  45  59  14  31  93  85
2  92  97  34  10  83  32  42
3  74  89  79  27  39  22   5
4  36   2  37  39  69  11  67
5  24  59  34  37  13   7   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. However, since there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will inevitably receive an extra item. To make the allocation as fair as possible, we should try to distribute items based on the highest values each agent places on them.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (97) and has no higher valuation for any other item.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 (98) the highest, which is already taken, so we give them the next highest valued item, item 5 (93).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 (97) the highest. 
4. Agent 3 values item 1 (89) as second highest after item 2 (79).
5. Agent 4 values item 4 (69) the highest.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 (59) the highest after items 0 and 2 which are already taken.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 3 and 6 (since item 3 is the remaining and item 6 is lowest valued)

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed and accounts for each agent's valuation preferences as much as possible.
