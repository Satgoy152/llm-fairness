Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  87  96  34  29  11  88
1  52  15   1  40  15  18   4
2  58   1  83  78  60  50  36
3  30  85  93  22  60  92  32
4  14  87  34  67  52  26  21
5  51  80  42  75   6  76  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that seeks to maximize the value that each agent receives based on their individual valuations. We'll aim to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that the overall allocation is as balanced as possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and allocate those items if they are not already taken.
2. Ensure that no item is allocated more than once.
3. Adjust as necessary to make sure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's work through the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value items for agent 0 are items 2 (96), 6 (88), and 1 (87). We can allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1: Highest value item for agent 1 is item 0 (52). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2: Highest value item for agent 2 is item 2 (83), but it is already taken. Next highest is item 3 (78). Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3: Highest value item for agent 3 is item 2 (93), but it is already taken. Next is item 1 (85). Allocate item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4: Highest value item for agent 4 is item 1 (87), but it is already taken. Next is item 3 (67), but it is also taken. Next is item 4 (52). Allocate item 4 to agent 4.
- Agent 5: Highest value item for agent 5 is item 6 (99). Allocate item 6 to agent 5.

Now, let's check if all items are allocated and make adjustments:

- Items allocated so far: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Remaining item: 5

Since agent 5 has only one item so far, it makes sense to give them item 5 as well to balance the allocation a bit more.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.
