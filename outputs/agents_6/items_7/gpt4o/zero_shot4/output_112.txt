Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  78  22  62  60  65  30
1   4   7  98  77  10  80  52
2  68  50  83  16  61  84  10
3  72  53  61  27   9  81  17
4  26  78   8  24  49  66  29
5  91  79  50  57  70  89  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total value assigned to each agent. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total value is reasonably balanced compared to others, ensuring no agent is significantly advantaged or disadvantaged.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 5 (value 91).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 78).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 98).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 62).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 5 (value 70).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 84).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 17).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly, and the distribution of valuable items is balanced among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```
