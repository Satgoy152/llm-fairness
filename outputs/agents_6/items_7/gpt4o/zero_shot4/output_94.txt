Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  76  87  50  23   9  87
1  21  33  82  91  21  50  72
2  19  81  83  49  11   9  92
3  16  34  50  56  25  22   2
4  10  91  37  79  19  46  61
5  44   3  78  74   8  38  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider using a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one way to fairly allocate them is by considering the highest valuations each agent has for specific items and making sure that every agent receives at least one item (if possible), while some agents might not receive any depending on the optimal allocation.

Let's go through this step by step:

1. **Identify the highest value each agent has for the items.**
2. **Allocate items by matching items to the agents who value them the most.**
3. **Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, with some agents possibly receiving no items if needed to minimize the total number of items per agent to 1.**

Based on the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values item 0 (89) highly.
- Agent 1 values item 3 (91) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 (92) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 3 (56) highly, but item 3 is already chosen by agent 1.
- Agent 4 values item 1 (91) highly.
- Agent 5 values item 2 (78) highly.

Now, let's make the allocations:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Assign item 2 to agent 5.

Now, we have 5 items allocated, and we need to allocate 2 more:

- Agent 3 will receive no item as agent 1 already took the item they value the most.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 1 (since they value item 3 and 4 closely) to balance allocations.
- Allocate item 5 to agent 0 (since they value item 5 more than the remaining agents) to balance allocations.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items and maximizing the values based on their preferences given the constraints.
