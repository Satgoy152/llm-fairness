Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  49  35  76  79   4  27
1  74  87  56  79   4  79  86
2  17  80  70  28  76  46  63
3  76  87  54  91  85  50   0
4  66  55  93  16  23  87   5
5  47  27  10  16  50  85  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent should get approximately the same number of items. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive one item while others may receive none. We'll try to distribute the items based on each agent's valuations, ensuring a fair distribution according to their preferences.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 3. We'll assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3. We'll assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly. We'll assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for item 3. We'll assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 highly. We'll assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has a relatively high valuation for item 4. We'll assign item 4 to Agent 5.

Now we have assigned 6 items. The remaining item, item 6, can be assigned to the agent with the least number of items or to the agent with a reasonable valuation. Since Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6, we'll assign it to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value reasonably, and all items are distributed among the agents.
