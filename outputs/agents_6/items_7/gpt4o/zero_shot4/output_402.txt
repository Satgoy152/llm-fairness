Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  26  33  36  71  91  62
1  59  38  15  68  15  33  14
2  39  34  62  20  21  69  69
3  72  87   5  93  23  45  97
4  63  28  99  58  64  72  43
5  63  89  66  73  95  75  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A possible approach is to maximize the total valuation across all agents, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, while making sure that the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.

Let's start by looking at the highest valuations and try to assign items based on these values, giving preference to ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

1. **Highest valuations**:
   - Agent 3 values item 3 at 93.
   - Agent 3 values item 1 at 87.
   - Agent 4 values item 2 at 99.
   - Agent 5 values item 4 at 95.
   - Agent 5 values item 1 at 89.
   - Agent 5 values item 3 at 73.
   - Agent 0 values item 5 at 91.

2. **Assign items to maximize valuations**:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 93).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value 99).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 5 (value 95).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 91).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 72) to satisfy the need to have each agent receive at least one item.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 5 (value 89).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 69) to ensure all agents receive an item and maximize value.

3. **Final allocations**:
   - Agent 0: [5]
   - Agent 1: [] (no items allocated)
   - Agent 2: [6]
   - Agent 3: [0, 3]
   - Agent 4: [2]
   - Agent 5: [1, 4]

Now let's express the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```
