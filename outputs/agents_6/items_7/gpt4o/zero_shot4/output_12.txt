Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  92  55  94  45  10  76
1  16  86  61  75  51  29  85
2  44  72  70  21  99  55  10
3  15  98  37  70  67  42  50
4  43  27  65   4  18  32  27
5  29  83  95  89   9  82  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that provide them with the highest possible value, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's how the allocations can be done:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3. Assign these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6. Assign this to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 highly. Assign this to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 highly, but since it's already taken, assign item 3, which has a moderate value.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 can be assigned item 2, which has a moderate value.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 5.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, maximizing the individual valuation for the items assigned to them, while ensuring all items are distributed.
