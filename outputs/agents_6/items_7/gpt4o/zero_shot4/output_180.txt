Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  59  76  92  22  12  48
1   9  79  75  32  21  33  40
2  38  36  57  82  70  41  66
3  70   5  81  77   9  78  37
4  16  38  57  27  18  88  67
5  24  57  27  95  36  58  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations, while ensuring every item is allocated.

Here's the optimal allocation based on maximizing the agents' total valuations:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (92) and item 2 (76).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (79).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 6 (66).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 5 (78).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 5 (88) but since it’s already taken, item 6 (67) can be considered, but since it is also taken, item 2 (57) can be considered.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 3 (95) but since it’s already taken, item 5 (58) can be considered.

Considering these preferences, the items can be allocated as follows:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for unassigned items).

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that every agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.
