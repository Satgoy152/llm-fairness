Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  63  35  84  23  61  98
1  44  28  37  80  76  10  65
2  39   4  16  11  27  21  87
3  34  87  61  86  58  65  39
4  13  76  92  82  34  38  87
5  91  97  81  98  42  44  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 28 37 80 76 10 65]
 [39  4 16 11 27 21 87]

 [13 76 92 82 34 38 87]
 [91 97 81 98 42 44 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they value highly while ensuring all items are allocated. Given the valuations, a reasonable approach is to assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to the items and ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the table to identify the best allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (98).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (80).
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (87), but Agent 0 already took it. The next best option is item 0 (39).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (87).
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (92).
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest (98), but Agent 1 already took it. The next best option is item 1 (97).

Now we will allocate the remaining items to the agents:

- Agent 0 already has item 6.
- Agent 1 has item 3.
- Agent 2 has item 0.
- Agent 3 has item 1.
- Agent 4 has item 2.
- Agent 5 gets items 4 and 5, as they have leftover capacity and relatively high values for these items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```
