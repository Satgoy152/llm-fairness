Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  97  36  78  41  55  21
1  31  50  12  47   3  43  46
2  42  50  97  71  30  28  95
3   1  37  22   0  89  72  25
4  13  59  42  91  43  83  17
5  63  10  68  77  16  67  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [42 50 97 71 30 28 95]

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we need to consider the preferences or valuations each agent has for each item while ensuring that every agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the table, we can attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuations for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by agent 5 (63).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (97).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (97).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by agent 4 (91).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (89).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by agent 4 (83).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (95).

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item and only seven items are allocated:

- Agent 5: Item 0
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 6
- Agent 4: Items 3 and 5
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 1: No items

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned while keeping each agent's interest in mind.
