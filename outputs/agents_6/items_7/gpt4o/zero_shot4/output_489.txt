Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  40  77  17  63  62  20
1  13  16  50  73  76  50  63
2  91  86  17  85  83  73  16
3   2  88  46  21  25  63  10
4  57  92  59   7  23   6  34
5   6  27  93  93  84  47  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are distributed, we need to consider the valuations and distribute accordingly. Here is one possible solution:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (77)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (76)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (91)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (88)
   
5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (6, which is not optimal, but based on remaining items)
   
6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (93)

Remaining item, 6, needs to be allocated. Agent 5's second highest preference is item 6 (76), so they can receive this item too.

Here's how the allocation can look:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive items based on their preferences, and all 7 items are distributed.
