Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  56  15  97  18  43  76
1  72  87  32  20  85  63  92
2  49  40  52  47   0  59  74
3  38  96  27  19  98  21  89
4  60  60  93  28  96  41  98
5   1  10   4  16  20  88  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, or as close to that as possible given there are only 7 items and 6 agents. Here's a possible allocation that tries to balance the value:

1. Agent 0: Assign item 3 with value 97 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Agent 1: Assign item 6 with value 92 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Agent 2: Assign item 5 with value 59 (highest value for Agent 2 among remaining items).
4. Agent 3: Assign item 1 with value 96 (highest value for Agent 3).
5. Agent 4: Assign item 4 with value 96 (highest value for Agent 4 among remaining items).
6. Agent 5: Assign item 0 with value 1 (though low, it ensures every agent gets at least one item).
7. Now we have one item left and Agent 5 has received the least value. Assign item 2 to Agent 5 with value 4.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, except for Agent 5 who receives two due to receiving the overall lowest value.
