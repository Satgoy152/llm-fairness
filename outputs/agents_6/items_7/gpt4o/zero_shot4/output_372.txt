Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  72  24  53  74  80  37
1  17  68  41  33  29  69  23
2  87  73  52  20  68   5  87
3   8  83  75  30  94  29  90
4  66  88  81  27  42  21  32
5  33  50  54  94  25  57  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it (98).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 4, as they have the highest valuation for it (88).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 4, as they have the second-highest valuation for it (81).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 5, as they have the highest valuation for it (94).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3, as they have the highest valuation for it (94).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it (80).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (87).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most highly, and all items are assigned. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
