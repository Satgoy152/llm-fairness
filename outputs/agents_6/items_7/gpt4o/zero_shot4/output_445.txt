Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  45  75  76  17  57  32
1  57  19  70  37  61  28  33
2   5  37  92  43  40  34  66
3  16  26   9  36  16  50  11
4  33  54  50  93   2  46  44
5  75  68  51  56  85  49  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated. We'll aim to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

One approach to this is to use a method like maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives or trying to distribute items in a way that the total valuation across agents is as even as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 0 -> Assign item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 2 -> Assign item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 6 -> Assign item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 5 -> Assign item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 3 -> Assign item 3.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value for item 4 -> Assign item 4.

Now, item 1 is left unallocated. To allocate it fairly, we look at the remaining agents:

- Agent 0: Currently has a high value item but has the second-highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 1: Has one item with a reasonable valuation.
- Agent 2: Already has an item.
- Agent 3: Already has an item.
- Agent 4: Already has an item.
- Agent 5: Already has an item.

Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since it maximizes their total value further without adding to the already high allocation of another agent.

Here's the fair allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
```
