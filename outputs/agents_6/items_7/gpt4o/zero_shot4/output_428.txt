Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  35  46  70  46  57  83
1  19  27  43  37  52  55  14
2  48  84  55  72   2  59   4
3  59  36  66  73  68  98  93
4  16   2  38  46  63   9  28
5  93  36  56  12  23  18  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items, while the rest will receive one item each.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent**:
    - Agent 0: Item 6 (value 83)
    - Agent 1: Item 5 (value 55)
    - Agent 2: Item 1 (value 84)
    - Agent 3: Item 5 (value 98)
    - Agent 4: Item 4 (value 63)
    - Agent 5: Item 0 (value 93)

2. **Reallocate to ensure each agent receives one item**:
    - Since item 5 is assigned to both agent 1 and agent 3, we need to reallocate.
    - Assign item 5 to agent 3 (since agent 3 values it more), and assign item 3 to agent 1 (next highest available value for agent 1).

3. **Allocate the remaining item**:
    - Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for the unallocated item 2 (value 46).
    - Assign item 2 to agent 0.

Now, let's ensure all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item:
- Agent 0: [6, 2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [0]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
