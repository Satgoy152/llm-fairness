Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  41  31  37  69  59  45
1  81   8  98  59  38  18  66
2   6  37  47  51  11   6  59
3  26  52  58  84  47  86  54
4  99  75  99  70  76  79  57
5  12  94  98  33  40  13  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total perceived value for each agent. We need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, given the constraint of having 7 items and 6 agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 72)
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 98)
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (value 59)
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 84)
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 76)
- Agent 5 gets item 1 (value 94)

This allocation uses 6 items. To allocate the last item (item 5), we can assign it to the agent who gains the most additional value from it. 

- Agent 3 gets item 5 (value 86), as they already have a high valuation for item 5.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
