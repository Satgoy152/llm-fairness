Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  65  65  40  74  72  81
1   6  26  65  26  13   8  89
2  23  41   8  64  65  76  14
3  14  38  36   1  13  25  89
4  44  11  24  57  77  65  21
5  38   8  33  94  36  72   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the total value of items assigned to each agent is balanced. However, since we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items. Let's try to allocate based on the maximum value each agent has for any item, ensuring that one agent has two items.

Let's examine the preferences:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 6 (81).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 6 (89).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5 (76).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 6 (89).
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 4 (77).
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 3 (94).

Based on these preferences, we can prioritize assigning items based on the highest preference value for each agent, ensuring that one agent ends up with two items. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 5 since it's the highest value for them.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value after item 6).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (next available highest value).
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (since they have a high value for it and need a second item).

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
