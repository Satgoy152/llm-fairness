Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  40  20  41  94  91   9
1  10  43  55  24  94  64  12
2  74  45  19  17  76  49  41
3  17  46  43  72  68  39  52
4  18  88   6  44  93  63  30
5  86  34  27   2  73  43  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [86 34 27  2 73 43 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items. Let's try to distribute the items so that each agent gets approximately the same satisfaction, and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (94)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (55)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (74)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (72)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (88)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (43), Item 6 (22)

This allocation considers the higher valuations and attempts to distribute the items as evenly as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

The JSON format for this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
