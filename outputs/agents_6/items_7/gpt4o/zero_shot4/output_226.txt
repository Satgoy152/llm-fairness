Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  39  60  90  34   0   8
1  66  68  14  26  66  29  36
2  58  62  81  89  56  24  58
3  20  77  59  35  57  14  63
4  32  32  63   9  87  33  32
5  19  67  41  21  56  14  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple algorithm such as the "round-robin" method or try to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here, I'll attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuation is reasonably balanced.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value for each agent:** This will ensure that each agent gets at least one item that they value the most. However, since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items.

2. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 90)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 68)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (value 89)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (value 77)
   - Agent 4: Item 4 (value 87)
   - Agent 5: Item 1 (value 67)

3. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - The remaining items are 0, 2, 5, and 6. We will reassign some items to ensure fairness and maximize total valuation for each agent.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2, as it also has a high value for them.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as they have a moderate value for it.
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 5, as it has some value for them.
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 3, as it has a moderate value for them.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
``` 

This allocation tries to ensure each agent receives items they value highly, while keeping the distribution as fair as possible with the constraint of having 7 items and 6 agents.
