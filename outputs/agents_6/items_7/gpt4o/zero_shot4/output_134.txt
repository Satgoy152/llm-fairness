Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  56  60  71   8  25  55
1  99  97  27  84  77  54  36
2  55  73  66  97  92  57  33
3   2  30  77  46  56  42  62
4  64  88  40  28  70  58  23
5  73  91   8  44  33  11  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is item 3 (value 71).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is item 0 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is item 3, but it is already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 4 (value 92).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is item 2 (value 77).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is item 1 (value 88).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item is item 1, but it is already taken by Agent 4. Next highest is item 0 (value 73), but it is taken. Next is item 5 (value 11).

Let's initially allocate based on the highest available value for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 5

This leaves item 6 unallocated. 

Now let's review the allocations and resolve unallocated/overlapping items:

- Agent 0 has item 3.
- Agent 1 has item 0.
- Agent 2 has item 4.
- Agent 3 has item 2.
- Agent 4 has item 1.
- Agent 5 has item 5.

Allocate the remaining item to any agent who might have a lower total value or fewer items:

- Agent 5, who has the lowest total value, can take item 6.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Items 5, 6

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
