Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  11  85  62  28  92  93
1  98  46  93  15  33  87  62
2  78  33  24  78  74  39  19
3  47  69  23  22   9  24  67
4   4  88  63  22  72  14  74
5   7  27  73  81  10   1  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [98 46 93 15 33 87 62]
 [78 33 24 78 74 39 19]

 [ 7 27 73 81 10  1 37]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every item is assigned to exactly one agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 5 and 6.
2. Agent 1 places high value on item 0.
3. Agent 2 finds value in item 3.
4. Agent 4 values item 1 and item 4.
5. Agent 5 finds item 2 valuable.

Let's allocate items based on these observations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 98).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (value 88).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (value 73).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 78).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value 72).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 92).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 93).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to only one agent and tries to respect the preferences of the agents based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
