Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  20  36   0  35  21  68
1  17   3  97  63  27  67  28
2  96  30  58  45  32  97  99
3  33  35  65   5  65  72  75
4  55  92  13  25  18  25  15
5  23  64  13  49  83  36  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This is typically done by allocating items such that each agent gets items they value relatively highly, while ensuring that all items are assigned. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive an extra item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 6, 2
   - Allocated item: 6

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 2, 5
   - Allocated item: 2

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 6, 5
   - Allocated item: 5

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 5, 6
   - Allocated item: 3

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value items: 1, 0
   - Allocated items: 1, 0 (Agent 4 receives two items, as it has relatively high values for these items and we need to allocate all items)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest value items: 4, 6
   - Allocated item: 4

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are distributed. Now, let's format this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 0],
    "5": [4]
}
```
