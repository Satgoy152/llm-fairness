Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  86  71  69  65  58  47
1  39  68  31  21   4  12  87
2  80  23  11  59  21  22  71
3  61  30   5   6   7  83  48
4  64  51  47  32  64  66  84
5  65  34  47   7  12  56  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 86 71 69 65 58 47]
 [39 68 31 21  4 12 87]
 [80 23 11 59 21 22 71]
 [61 30  5  6  7 83 48]
 [64 51 47 32 64 66 84]
 [65 34 47  7 12 56 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. After analyzing the table, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most with a score of 82.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most with a score of 87.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the second most after Agent 0. However, since Agent 0 already has item 0, we assign item 2 to Agent 2, who values it more than other unassigned items.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most with a score of 83.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the second most after Agent 1. However, since Agent 1 already has item 6, we assign item 4 to Agent 4, who values it with a score of 64.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 the third most after Agent 0 and Agent 2. So, we assign item 3 to Agent 5, who values it more than other unassigned items.

Now we have assigned items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We still need to assign item 1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most with a score of 86, so we assign item 1 to Agent 0.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
