Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  31  13  64  41  52   3
1  36  98  87  92  69  11  20
2   2  12  52  14  96  90  65
3  24  43  24  49  57  40  48
4  15  59  33  80  69  52  77
5  35  18  95  65  55  51   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 31 13 64 41 52  3]
 [36 98 87 92 69 11 20]
 [ 2 12 52 14 96 90 65]
 [24 43 24 49 57 40 48]
 [15 59 33 80 69 52 77]
 [35 18 95 65 55 51  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item or a fair share of items based on their preferences. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (95)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (98)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (96)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (49)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (77)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (95)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 5 (51) (since no other agent has a very strong preference for Item 5, it can go to Agent 5 to ensure all items are allocated)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and ensures all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
