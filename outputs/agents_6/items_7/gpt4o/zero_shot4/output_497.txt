Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  61  43  20  82  59  88
1  35  69  11  74  45   3  38
2  91   5  71  86   6   9  44
3  76  95  18  49   6  82  98
4  78  25  69  57  57   7  50
5  29  58   1  13  10  11   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 6 (value 88), so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 1 (value 69), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 0 (value 91), so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 5 (value 82), so we allocate item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values item 2 (value 69), so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent can be allocated item 3 (value 13) for some value.

Now, we have only one item left (item 4). We can allocate it to the agent who would benefit most from it:

- **Agent 0** values item 4 at 82.
- **Agent 1** values item 4 at 45.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 at 6.
- **Agent 3** values item 4 at 6.
- **Agent 4** values item 4 at 57.
- **Agent 5** values item 4 at 10.

Since Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4, we allocate item 4 to Agent 0 to maximize their total valuation.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
