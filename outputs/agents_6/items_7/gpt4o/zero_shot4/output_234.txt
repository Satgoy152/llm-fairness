Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  18   5  42  39   0   8
1  40  33  49  39  65  71  76
2  65  96  21  34  84  12  61
3  67  28  22  25  93  10  18
4  39  75   3  91   2  90  54
5  86  69  23  29  26  26   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. A simple method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since there are 6 agents and 7 items, we may need to adjust to ensure that every agent gets at least one item if possible and no item is left unallocated. Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. Find out who values each item the most and assign that item to them.
2. If any agent doesn't receive an item, try to adjust the allocation to ensure that the unassigned agent can receive an item.

Let's look at the values:

- For Item 0: Agent 5 values it highest at 86.
- For Item 1: Agent 2 values it highest at 96.
- For Item 2: Agent 1 values it highest at 49.
- For Item 3: Agent 4 values it highest at 91.
- For Item 4: Agent 3 values it highest at 93.
- For Item 5: Agent 1 values it highest at 71.
- For Item 6: Agent 1 values it highest at 76.

Initially, this allocation might have some agents without items, so we will adjust by ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 5.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 4.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 to ensure they receive an item.

This gives Agent 0 an item, which was initially unallocated.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
