Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  93  92  71  91  33   4
1  38  55  90  46   1  76  17
2  52   0  91   0  29  73  85
3  63  23  60  36  74  72  34
4  77  32  63  12  91   1  90
5  11  91  83  39  56  38  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple greedy approach, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible and that the total number of allocated items is equal to 7.

Let's apply this method:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (92).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (93).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (90).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (71).
- Item 4: Agent 0 and Agent 4 both value it (91). We can assign it to Agent 4 to ensure a more balanced distribution.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (76).
- Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (97).

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the current allocation, we notice that Agent 2 and Agent 3 are not yet allocated any items. To balance the allocations, we can make slight adjustments:

- Reassign Item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 2, as Item 5 has a high value for Agent 2 (73) compared to other unassigned agents.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3, as it has a reasonable value for them (36).

The final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
