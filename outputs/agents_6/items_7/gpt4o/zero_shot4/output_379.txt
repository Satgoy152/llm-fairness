Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  31  16   0  27  17  36
1  74  48  57  53  75  79  10
2  17  23  91  14  50  14  46
3  47  61  99  92  92  92  50
4   7  49  24  57  74  50  80
5  69  18  45  48  47  32  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We aim to distribute all 7 items in a way that each agent gets at least one item or no items, and the total number of allocated items equals 7. 

Let's evaluate the highest value items for each agent and distribute accordingly:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3.
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 6.
6. Agent 5 has the highest value for item 0, but since it's already taken, we allocate the next highest, item 6, which is also taken. Therefore, we give Agent 5 item 4.

Now we have used items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We still have item 1 remaining:

7. We can give item 1 to Agent 4, as they have a reasonably high valuation for it.

The allocations following the above reasoning are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 1],
    "5": [4]
}
```
