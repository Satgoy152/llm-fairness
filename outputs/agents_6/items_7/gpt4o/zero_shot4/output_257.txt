Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  12  77  46  12  77  80
1  28  16  84  97  86  33  90
2  84  67  31  48   9   1  77
3  92  97  75  22   6  12  72
4  55   1  71  77  92  66  76
5   3   8  61  17  84  66  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the preferences or valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation of the allocations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items allocated: 0 (Value: 86)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items allocated: 3 (Value: 97)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items allocated: 2 (Value: 31)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items allocated: 1 (Value: 97)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Items allocated: 4 (Value: 92)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Items allocated: 5, 6 (Values: 66, 77)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
