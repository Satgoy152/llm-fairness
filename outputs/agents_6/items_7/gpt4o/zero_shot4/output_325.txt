Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  65  64  19  57  20  12
1  23  27  38  10  14  56  31
2  63   8  53  96  26  28  41
3  65  25  21  72  26  80  84
4  27  16  12  10   4  63  20
5  10  75  87  29  20  87  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a simple heuristic such as maximizing the minimum value that each agent receives. This approach ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to distribute the value as evenly as possible.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are 1 (65) and 2 (64). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is 5 (56). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is 3 (96). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is 6 (84). Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is 5 (63), but it's already assigned. The next highest is 0 (27). Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for Agent 5 is 6 (95), but it's already assigned. The next highest is 2 (87). Assign item 2 to Agent 5.

After these assignments, we have allocated 6 items, and one item (4) is left unallocated:

7. **Remaining Item 4**: Assign the last remaining item 4 to the agent who values it the most and hasn't reached their highest value item. Agent 0 values it at 57, which is the highest among those available, but they already have a high-value item. Assign it to Agent 1 who values it at 14.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```
