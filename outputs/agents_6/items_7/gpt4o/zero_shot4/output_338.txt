Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  12  98  86  20   6   0
1  70  29   2  99  47  97  91
2   6  82  25  30  34  35  49
3   4  21   3  82   9   2  81
4  76  59   9   9  45  96  57
5   4  56  41  61  97  99  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. Our goal is to maximize fairness, possibly focusing on ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

We start by looking at the highest valuations each agent has for items and try to allocate based on those preferences, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 very highly (98).
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly (99).
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly (82).
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly (81).
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly (76).
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly (99).

This covers 6 items, and we need to allocate 1 more item, which could be assigned to the agent with the least total value so far, or an agent with a lower number of allocated items, to balance fairness. Let's allocate item 4 to agent 5, who values it the second most after item 5.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 4]
}
```
