Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  39  31  61  14  23  66
1  73  78  38  99  33  93  24
2  10  85  24  97  20  53  49
3  22  20  19  38  66  97  85
4   1  89  97  73  35  43  84
5  10  50  54   2  12  13  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the distribution is fair and all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Rank the items for each agent:** Determine how much each agent values each item.
2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuations:** Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring each item is only given to one agent.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (74) and 6 (66).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (99).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (97), but since item 3 is already assigned, we take the next highest, item 1 (85).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (97).
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (97).
- **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (54), but since item 2 is already assigned, we take the next highest, item 1 (50).

After looking at the highest valuations, the items can be distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each of the 7 items is assigned to an agent, and no item is assigned to more than one agent.
