Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  12   4   0  35  82  58
1  77  93  29  88  66  46  13
2  43  21   0   5  61  14  81
3   7  50  83   6   5  76   8
4  51  15  73  70  71  16  83
5  50   9  33  26  16  65  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[66 12  4  0 35 82 58]
 [77 93 29 88 66 46 13]
 [43 21  0  5 61 14 81]
 [ 7 50 83  6  5 76  8]
 [51 15 73 70 71 16 83]
 [50  9 33 26 16 65 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each. Here's an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 (value 82) - highest value for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (value 93) - highest value for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6 (value 81) - highest value for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 2 (value 83) - highest value for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4 (value 71) - highest value for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 3 (value 26) - highest value for Agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate one more item. Consider the remaining items for the best value:

- **Remaining item**: 0

Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 77), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
