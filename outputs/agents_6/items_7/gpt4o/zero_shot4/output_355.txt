Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79   2  45  53  55  78  66
1  69   0  34  29  54  87  57
2  38  69  59  73  88  79  66
3  64  71  44  90   0  53  32
4  80  47  68  63  57  52   5
5  38  99  47  50   4  22   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79  2 45 53 55 78 66]
 [69  0 34 29 54 87 57]
 [38 69 59 73 88 79 66]
 [64 71 44 90  0 53 32]

 [38 99 47 50  4 22  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while distributing all items. After reviewing the valuations, here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 4 because agent 4 has the highest valuation of 80.
- Assign item 1 to agent 5 because agent 5 has the highest valuation of 99.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 because agent 0 has a high valuation of 45.
- Assign item 3 to agent 3 because agent 3 has the highest valuation of 90.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 because agent 2 has the highest valuation of 88.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 because agent 1 has a high valuation of 87.
- Assign item 6 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it at 66, which is reasonably high.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, with some agents potentially receiving no items if their valuations are low compared to others. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```
