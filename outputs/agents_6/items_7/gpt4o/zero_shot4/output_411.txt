Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  50  16  54  91  27  87
1  37   6  64  86  32   7  50
2  26  62  27  40  14  19  89
3  70  80  44   3  24  56  74
4  38  88  37   7  79  26  40
5   5  25  52  58  60  68  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37  6 64 86 32  7 50]
 [26 62 27 40 14 19 89]

 [38 88 37  7 79 26 40]
 [ 5 25 52 58 60 68 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation of items for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highly (91). Let's assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 highly (86). Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 highly (89). Assign item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highly (80). Assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 highly (88), but item 1 is already allocated. The next highest is item 4 (79), but it's taken. Assign item 0 (38) to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 5 highly (68). Assign item 5 to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. One more item needs to be allocated. We need to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

7. **Unallocated Item**: Item 2 is still available. Let's assign it to agent 4, who currently has the lowest total valuation.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [5]
}
```
