Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  18  35  69  72  82  16
1  87  47  91   7  68  41  41
2  50  44  51  39  36  74  80
3  16  34  51  23  34  70  53
4  49   9   1  54  52  48  72
5  52  21  26  62  24  20  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of items based on their valuations. We'll attempt to balance maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the most.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the most.
5. **Agent 4**: Values items 6 and 3 the most.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 the most.

After analyzing the valuations, here is a possible allocation that aims to distribute the items fairly:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it the most.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 5, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they have a reasonable valuation for it.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they have a reasonable valuation for it.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.
