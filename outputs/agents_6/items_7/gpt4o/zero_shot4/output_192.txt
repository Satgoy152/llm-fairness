Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  72  86  89  72  43  38
1  50  97  93  36  37  66  91
2  88  18  23  97  45  20   4
3  77  82  59  24  16  92  14
4  97  22  48  52  52  88   3
5  32   2  68  80  25  66  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the sum of valuations each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are assigned and each agent can receive zero or more items.

Let's consider the values each agent assigns to each item and try to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is maximized:

```
Agent 0: 81, 72, 86, 89, 72, 43, 38
Agent 1: 50, 97, 93, 36, 37, 66, 91
Agent 2: 88, 18, 23, 97, 45, 20, 4
Agent 3: 77, 82, 59, 24, 16, 92, 14
Agent 4: 97, 22, 48, 52, 52, 88, 3
Agent 5: 32, 2, 68, 80, 25, 66, 54
```

Allocation strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If an agent gets more than one item, consider swapping to ensure fairness.

Let's assign the items:

- Item 0: Highest value is 97 (Agent 4)
- Item 1: Highest value is 97 (Agent 1)
- Item 2: Highest value is 93 (Agent 1)
- Item 3: Highest value is 97 (Agent 2)
- Item 4: Highest value is 72 (Agent 0)
- Item 5: Highest value is 92 (Agent 3)
- Item 6: Highest value is 91 (Agent 1)

After some adjustments to ensure fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 4
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2
- Agent 2 gets item 3
- Agent 3 gets item 5
- Agent 4 gets item 0
- Agent 5 gets item 6

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6]
}
```
