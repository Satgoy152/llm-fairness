Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  58   9  63  42  66  99
1  92  49  61  33  89  91  17
2  70  99  60  57  94  10  14
3  11  32  14  22  74  36  96
4  21  24   4  27  77  99  45
5  23  84  13  52  62  41  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. Additionally, we should aim to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is maximized, which often involves assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Let's follow a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (99).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (96), but item 6 is already taken. Next highest is item 4 (74).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (99).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (84), but item 1 is already taken. Next highest is item 3 (52).

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.
- Agent 5 gets item 3.

We have allocated 6 items so far. Only item 2 remains unallocated. Since it has a relatively low valuation for all agents, we can assign it to the agent with the least total value from their assigned items. Let's re-evaluate:

After reassessment, we'll assign item 2 to Agent 3, as they currently have one of the lower total values:

- Agent 3: Item 4 (74) and item 2 (14).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has received their best available items to maximize fairness and valuation.
