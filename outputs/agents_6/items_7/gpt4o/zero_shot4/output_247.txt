Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  29  93  60  67  93   7
1  89  53  85  30  43  75  86
2  98  81  15  47  20  34   1
3  28  93  97  53  90  28  29
4  79  51  58  35  78  81  70
5  15  30   3  74  84  75   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 53 85 30 43 75 86]
 [98 81 15 47 20 34  1]
 [28 93 97 53 90 28 29]
 [79 51 58 35 78 81 70]
 [15 30  3 74 84 75  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One way to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 93.
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 97.
4. Item 3: Agent 5 values it the most at 74.
5. Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most at 84.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 86.

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. However, not every agent can receive an item due to the limited number of items available compared to the number of agents.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```
