Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  78  11  34   4  44  72
1  34  18  52  43  85  79  93
2  78  30   3  50  90  21  80
3  33  24  19  41  13  94  39
4   4  88  55  42  17  91  20
5  44  80  77  34  59  58  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute the items based on the valuations in such a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use a method like the "maximum sum of valuations" or "maximizing the Nash social welfare" to ensure a fair allocation. Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for agent 0 are item 0 (92) and item 6 (72). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values for agent 1 are item 6 (93) and item 4 (85). Assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values for agent 2 are item 4 (90) and item 6 (80). Assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 5 (94). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 1 (88). Assign item 1 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for agent 5 is item 2 (77). Assign item 2 to agent 5.

After these assignments, only item 3 remains unallocated. To ensure all items are allocated, we can assign item 3 to the agent who has the next highest valuation for any unallocated items. In this case, agent 0 has a decent valuation for item 3 (34).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```
