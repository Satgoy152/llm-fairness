Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  49  26  12   3  89  76
1  78  58  74   5  98  17  62
2  60  12  29  22  77  29  92
3  23  23  22  64  73  78  13
4  57  96  58  76   2  84   3
5  15  25  30  76  39   5  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each item is only allocated once and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 the most (95). We allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the most (98). We allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 the most (92). We allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 the most (78). We allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 1 the most (96). We allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 3 the most (76). We allocate item 3 to Agent 5.

Now, all items except item 2 have been allocated. Let's allocate item 2 to the agent with the next highest valuation:

7. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the most after their previously allocated item (74). We allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item (except possibly one), and all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```
