Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0   6  79  18  31  25  22
1   9  22  66  77   8  24  59
2  25  54  78  66  69  89  98
3  73   2  10  55  72  90  51
4   1  47  64  68   0  34  83
5  16  42  42  76  87  58  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 0  6 79 18 31 25 22]
 [ 9 22 66 77  8 24 59]
 [25 54 78 66 69 89 98]

 [ 1 47 64 68  0 34 83]
 [16 42 42 76 87 58 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should ensure that the total value each agent receives is balanced as much as possible, given their valuations. Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 2 values item 6 highly with a value of 98.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly with a value of 90.
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly with a value of 87.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly with a value of 77.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly with a value of 64.
- Agent 0 values item 1 with a value of 6.
  
For the remaining item 0, we should allocate it to the agent that maximizes fairness without disrupting the other allocations. Let's allocate it to Agent 4, as they have currently received a medium value item and could benefit from another item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 0],
    "5": [4]
}
```
