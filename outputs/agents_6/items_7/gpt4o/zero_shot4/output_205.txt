Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  92   5  43  62  45   0
1  62  58  28  14  72   4   3
2  98  29  61  72  29  23  95
3   5  98  39  87  88  55  70
4  52  42  91  81  69   8  22
5   8  66  18  24  30  16  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items such that their total value is as evenly distributed as possible. 

Let's analyze the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (92), Item 4 (62)

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (72), Item 0 (62)

3. **Agent 2** values:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 6 (95)

4. **Agent 3** values:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (98), Item 4 (88)

5. **Agent 4** values:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (91), Item 3 (81)

6. **Agent 5** values:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (66), Item 4 (30)

From these observations, we can make the following allocations to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their highest preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Item 6
- **Agent 3**: Item 4
- **Agent 4**: Item 2
- **Agent 5**: Item 5

Now, only one item remains unallocated, which is Item 3. We can allocate this item to Agent 4 to equalize the distribution since they have a relatively high valuation for it and currently only have one item.

The final allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3],
    "5": [5]
}
```
