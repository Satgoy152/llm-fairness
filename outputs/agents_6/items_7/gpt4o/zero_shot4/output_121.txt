Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  72  40  61  58  68  79
1  33  83   8  83   8  50  94
2   7  50  15   2  55  68  68
3  16  98  53  50  63  40  89
4  45  58  58  11  94  47  84
5  70  65  53  12  81  26  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 7 items being allocated. One possible approach is to consider the preferences or valuations of the agents for the items and attempt to maximize the satisfaction or value each agent receives from their allocated items. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 6. 
2. Agent 1 highly values items 3 and 6.
3. Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 5.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 4.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 0.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 0

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Below is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
