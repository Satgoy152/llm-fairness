Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  91  48  96  56  89  79
1  10  45  39  22  16  72  52
2  72  75  63  20  44  70   9
3  80  72  10  44   5  46  61
4  37  41  42   7  13  28  86
5  51  83  81  14  90  47  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Setup**: We have 6 agents and 7 items. Our goal is to allocate these items such that we maximize the total valuation across all agents.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by allocating items to agents based on the highest valuation available for each item. This means, for each item, determine which agent values it the most and allocate it to that agent.

3. **Ensure Allocation Completeness**: Since we have more agents than items, ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, or at least maximize the total value while distributing all items.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 83 (Agent 0)
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 91 (Agent 0)
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 81 (Agent 5)
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 96 (Agent 0)
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 90 (Agent 5)
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 89 (Agent 0)
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 86 (Agent 4)

Now we have an allocation based on the highest valuation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 5]
- Agent 5: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 4: Item [6]

However, we must distribute items ensuring all agents have the opportunity to get an item. Adjusting slightly to ensure a more even distribution while maintaining high total value:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 5: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 4: Item [6]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Item [6]

Now, let's present this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the sum of the valuations while ensuring a fair distribution across agents.
