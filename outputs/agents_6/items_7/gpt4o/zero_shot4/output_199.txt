Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  78  92  34  29  90  60
1  61  36  24  25  57  60  66
2  65  12  65  30  50  40  59
3  91   8  86  87  21  43   9
4  37  66   1  22  73  22  97
5  17  74  96  80  65  61  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 78 92 34 29 90 60]
 [61 36 24 25 57 60 66]
 [65 12 65 30 50 40 59]
 [91  8 86 87 21 43  9]
 [37 66  1 22 73 22 97]
 [17 74 96 80 65 61 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. Given the constraints, here is one possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 3 (valuation 91)
- Assign item 1 to agent 5 (valuation 74)
- Assign item 2 to agent 5 (valuation 96)
- Assign item 3 to agent 3 (valuation 87)
- Assign item 4 to agent 4 (valuation 73)
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (valuation 90)
- Assign item 6 to agent 4 (valuation 97)

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4, 6],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

This ensures that all 7 items are allocated among the agents.
