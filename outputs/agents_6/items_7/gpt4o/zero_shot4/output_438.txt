Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  86  70  19  84  84  19
1  89  36   7  61  38  35   6
2  24   1   2  68  28  73  34
3  63  73  54  86  90  24  94
4  56  99  69  53  25  69  23
5   7  52  80  74  17   5  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. A potential approach to achieve a fair allocation is to try and maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  86  70  19  84  84  19
1  89  36   7  61  38  35   6
2  24   1   2  68  28  73  34
3  63  73  54  86  90  24  94
4  56  99  69  53  25  69  23
5   7  52  80  74  17   5  29
```

We will aim to allocate the items in a way that distributes the value fairly among the agents, potentially by choosing items that maximize each agent's satisfaction. Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 89)
- Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 99)
- Assign item 2 to agent 5 (value 80)
- Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 86)
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 84)
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 73)
- Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 94)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while attempting to maximize the fairness based on the given valuations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, and attempts to give each agent items that they value highly.
