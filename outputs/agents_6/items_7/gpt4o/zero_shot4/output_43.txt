Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  45  90  96  30  29  25
1   7  97  81  14  24  80  47
2  68  34  70  11  22   7  48
3   5  99  51  24  66  11  84
4  47  15  30  70  54  95  61
5  29  66  79  18  71   7  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we will aim to assign items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most.
2. Ensure each item is only assigned to one agent.
3. Distribute the remaining item to the agent who can benefit the most from it, based on their next highest valuation.

Allocate items:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (highest value: 96)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (highest value: 97)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (highest value: 68)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (highest value: 84)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (highest value: 95)
- Agent 5: Item 4 (highest value: 71)

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and there is 1 more item (2) to allocate. We will assign this item to the agent who has the next highest valuation for an unallocated item. 

- Agent 0 has already item 3 but values item 2 at 90, which is unallocated and high, so we give item 2 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations.
