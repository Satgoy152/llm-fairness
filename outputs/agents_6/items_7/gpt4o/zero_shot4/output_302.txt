Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  33  68  58  35  30   1
1   1  57  23  86  17  64  34
2  78  51  77  30  27  34  49
3  43  11  44  23  72  23  58
4   8   4  73  98  30  12  52
5  66  13  21  22  23  72  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly seven. One possible approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the highest (96).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it the highest (86).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the highest (77).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 3 because agent 3 values it the highest (72).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 4 because agent 4 values it the highest (72).
6. Assign item 6 to agent 5 because agent 5 values it the highest (82).
7. Assign item 1 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it significantly (33) compared to other agents after their highest valued items are allocated.

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
