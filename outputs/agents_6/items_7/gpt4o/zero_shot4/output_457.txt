Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  52   8  81   2  28  65
1  55  99  38  10  74  49  57
2  90   1  85  21  94  82  17
3   6  23  13   2  46   0  74
4  17  95  74  39  53  14  99
5  54  68  37  32  47  95   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents where each agent gets at least one item, we can use a simple method of iterating through the items and assigning each to the agent who values it most. Here's how we might approach it:

1. For each item, find the agent with the highest valuation.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items and allocate them:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 90 by Agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 85 by Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 81 by Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 5.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 4.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item. If not, we would need to adjust the allocations to make it fair. Reviewing the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 4
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item 6
- Agent 5: Item 5

Agent 3 currently has no items, so we need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness. Let's reallocate one item from an agent that has more than one item to Agent 3.

- Reassign Item 4 (94 by Agent 2) to Agent 3, ensuring each agent has at least one item.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [5]

Here is the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```
