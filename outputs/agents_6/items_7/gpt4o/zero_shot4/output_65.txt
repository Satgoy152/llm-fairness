Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  31  60  80  55  73  12
1  29  14  96  32  55  57  68
2  37  23   8  25   1  57  34
3  38  54  94  15  68  28  75
4  65  90   2   7  54  23  62
5  54  29  54  97  26  34  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 14 96 32 55 57 68]
 [37 23  8 25  1 57 34]

 [65 90  2  7 54 23 62]
 [54 29 54 97 26 34 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to assign items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 3 (value 80).
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 2 (value 96).
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 5 (value 57).
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 6 (value 75).
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 1 (value 90).
6. **Agent 5**: Receives items 0 and 4 (values 54 and 26 respectively).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations.

The allocations in the requested JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```
