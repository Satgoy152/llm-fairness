Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  81  59   9  89  61  95
1   9  76  82  18  54  29  96
2  33  87  32  88  82  41  86
3  82  87  31  80  99  61  67
4  19  59  93  89   2  47  50
5  79  31  16  76  59   4  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the six agents such that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly seven, we can consider assigning items based on maximizing the agents' valuations. The goal is to ensure each agent receives at least one item while maximizing the total valuation.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0: Assign item 6 (value 95)
2. Agent 1: Assign item 2 (value 82)
3. Agent 2: Assign item 3 (value 88)
4. Agent 3: Assign item 4 (value 99)
5. Agent 4: Assign item 1 (value 59)
6. Agent 5: Assign item 0 (value 79)

Now, one item remains to be allocated. The remaining items are:
- Item 5: Unallocated

Since item 5 has the highest remaining valuation for Agent 2 (value 41), we can assign it to Agent 2 to maximize the allocation fairness.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```
