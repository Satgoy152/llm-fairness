Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  93   3  77  59  73  98
1  25  48  39  15  19  79  71
2  63  20  28  53   5  33   1
3  32  78  52  47  76  28  27
4  27  27  23  14  61  16  88
5  55  35  31  42  31  15   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to distribute the items such that overall satisfaction is maximized across all agents. Given that we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will each receive 1 item. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They have high valuations for items 0 and 6. Assign them item 6 (value 98).
2. **Agent 1**: They have a high valuation for item 5. Assign them item 5 (value 79).
3. **Agent 2**: They have a moderate valuation for item 3. Assign them item 3 (value 53).
4. **Agent 3**: They have a high valuation for item 1. Assign them item 1 (value 78).
5. **Agent 4**: They have a high valuation for item 6, but since it's already taken, assign them item 4 (value 61).
6. **Agent 5**: They have a moderate valuation for item 0. Assign them item 0 (value 55).

Now we have one item left, item 2, which we can assign to the agent who would benefit the most with an additional item. Agent 0 has already received a very high value item, so let's assign item 2 to an agent who has not yet received an item they highly value. This could be Agent 3, who values item 2 with 52.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the high-value preferences of the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
