Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  22  28  48  64  74  85
1  20  68  57  85  43   8   2
2   1   8  78  78  11  21  62
3  16  87  70  37  12  14  59
4  50  28  68  78  93  54  84
5  52   0  41  29   6  12  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the strategy of maximizing overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents that value them the most. This approach will ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their perceived value.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 52 by agent 5.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 87 by agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 78, with a tie between agents 2 and 4. We can assign it to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 85 by agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 93 by agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 74 by agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 85 by agent 0.

Using this allocation strategy, the items are assigned as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 0

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
