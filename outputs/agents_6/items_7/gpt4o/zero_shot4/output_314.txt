Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  28  51  51  55  81  62
1  72  15  61   4   8  46  90
2  69  96  23  35   3  68  39
3  19  62  67   4   3  70  65
4  24  87  37  50  14  41  18
5  36  75  37   9  74  67  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 96 23 35  3 68 39]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 2] with values (81, 51) for a total of 132.
- Agent 1: Item [6] with a value of 90.
- Agent 2: Item [1] with a value of 96.
- Agent 3: Item [3] with a value of 4.
- Agent 4: Item [0] with a value of 24.
- Agent 5: Item [4] with a value of 74.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```
