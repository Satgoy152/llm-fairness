Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  79   8  59  58  28  85
1  55  85  59  93  44  26  39
2  72  97  49  13  19  54  38
3  85  18  82  50  49  35  75
4  83  71  56  88  51  75   4
5  10  34  74  90  26  79   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, with the understanding that one agent will receive two items because there are more items than agents.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most (85).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (93).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most (97).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (85).
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the most (88), but since it's already taken, item 5 with value 75 is next.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the most (90), but it's taken, so item 5 with value 79 is next.

Given this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Item [6]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Item [5]
- Agent 5: Item [2]

This allocation assigns one item to each agent, except for one agent who needs to receive an additional item to ensure all 7 items are allocated. We'll choose the next highest value available for the agent that can benefit most without causing a conflict.

Let's review the assignments:

1. Agent 4 also values item 4 (51) next highest.
2. Thus, Agent 4 will also receive item 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
This allocation ensures all 7 items are fairly distributed among the agents.
