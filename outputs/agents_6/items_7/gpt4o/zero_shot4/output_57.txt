Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  80  74   9  44  30   5
1  13  11  66  82  54   4  20
2  40  75  84  40  28  66  13
3  74   9  29  85  81  69  80
4  39  73  89  97   3  45  41
5  46  36  54  46  49  85  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents while maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that assigns each item to the agent that values it the most. This approach aims to maximize total utility or satisfaction. Hereâ€™s how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 74.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 80.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it the most at 89.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the most at 97.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most at 81.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it the most at 85.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most at 80.

However, since Agent 3 has already received two items, we will distribute item 6 to the second-highest bidder, which is Agent 1 at 20.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [2, 3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each item going to an agent who values it highly.
