Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  92  80  87  76  99  26
1  81  46  39  77  33  51   2
2  47  77  96  53  10  75   4
3  30  31   0  55  24  13  51
4  94  36  83  32  12  35  95
5  75  11  22   3  20  63  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow the strategy of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We aim to distribute the 7 items among the 6 agents.

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. First, assign the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Assign remaining items to agents with the next highest valuations without breaching the rule of allocating only 7 items in total.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5 and 1. Let's assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly, so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly, so assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly, but it's already taken. Thus, assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 highly, but it's already taken. Thus, assign item 3 to Agent 5.

Now, verify that all items have been allocated and each agent receives at least one item:

- Items assigned: 5, 0, 2, 6, 4, 3 (6 items total).
- Remaining item: 1.

Finally, assign the remaining item (1) to the agent with the next highest valuation who hasn't received an item yet. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as it increases the total valuation.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and all 7 items are distributed.
