Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  44  93   3  80  80  84
1  59  44  35  62  74  89  49
2  14  98  37  72  45  37   2
3  80  93  71  42  43  49  64
4  83  19  60  35  87   1  17
5  26  65  84  51  96  30  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives or at least ensure that the distribution is as balanced as possible. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while others will receive 1 item each. Here's one way to do this:

Let's summarize the approach:
1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent can get from any item and assign that item to them.
2. For the agent who will receive 2 items, choose additional items maximizing their benefit while ensuring no other agent is left without an item.
3. Ensure all items are allocated.

Following this strategy, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 5, as it's their highest value remaining.
- Agent 2 gets item 1, as it's their highest value.
- Agent 3 gets item 0, as it's their highest value.
- Agent 4 gets item 4, as it's their highest value.
- Agent 5 gets items 3 and 6 since they can benefit from two items and all other agents have received one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```
