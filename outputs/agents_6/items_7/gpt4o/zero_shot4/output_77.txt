Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  32  85  76  60  41  70
1  31  68  29  74  43  61  94
2  46  34  44  87  78  33  32
3  52  83  92  56  68  29  19
4  11  19  43  88   4  71  45
5  50  98  11  87  52   0   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method where we try to maximize each agent's valuation for the items they receive. Given the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items and only the 7 items are to be allocated, we can proceed as follows:

1. First, determine each agent's highest-valued item.
2. Attempt to allocate items by giving agents their top preferences while ensuring each item is allocated only once.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is for item 2 (85).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is for item 6 (94).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is for item 3 (87).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value is for item 2 (92), but item 2 is already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 1 (83).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value is for item 3 (88), but item 3 is already taken by Agent 2. Next highest is item 5 (71).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest value is for item 1 (98), but item 1 is already taken by Agent 3. Next highest is item 0 (50).

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

- Items currently allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Remaining item: 4

Let's allocate the remaining item to the agent with the next highest valuation that hasn't received an item yet:

- **Agent 4:** Next highest is item 4 (43).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 6 agents.
