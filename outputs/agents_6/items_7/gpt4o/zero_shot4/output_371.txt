Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  98  76   8  62  33   2
1  93  80  58  64  16  80   1
2  14  36  78  31  88  68  19
3  72  89  55   4  63  24  29
4  45  42  95  10  32  73  79
5  24  69  30  87  32  65  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79 98 76  8 62 33  2]
 [93 80 58 64 16 80  1]
 [14 36 78 31 88 68 19]
 [72 89 55  4 63 24 29]
 [45 42 95 10 32 73 79]
 [24 69 30 87 32 65 62]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each. 

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1 (value: 98).
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 (value: 93).
- Agent 2 receives Item 4 (value: 88).
- Agent 3 receives Item 3 (value: 4).
- Agent 4 receives Item 2 (value: 95).
- Agent 5 receives Items 5 and 6 (value: 65 and 62, respectively).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, with Agent 5 receiving two items due to the remaining count.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
