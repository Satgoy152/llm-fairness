Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  36  46  57  69  35  52
1   8  33  23  27  20  28  83
2  18  13  52  36  51  80  98
3  73  55  26  98  93  39  42
4  96   5  92  42  88  12  47
5  37  24  82  67  21  72  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers both the value each agent places on the items and ensures that each agent receives a reasonable number of items. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one approach is to allocate at least one item to as many agents as possible, while ensuring that the distribution is fair based on the valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 4 (value 69)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 6 (value 83)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 5 (value 80)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 (value 98)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 0 (value 96)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 2 (value 82)

The remaining item, item 1, can be allocated to the agent who values it the most among those who received lower-valued items. Agent 0 values item 1 at 36, which is a reasonable allocation since they received an item valued at 69, balancing the allocation reasonably.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```
