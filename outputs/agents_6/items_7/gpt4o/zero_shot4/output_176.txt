Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  17  66  37  21  56  91
1  34  79  11   1  68  89  21
2  10  87  22  28  60  73  43
3  84  67  23  74  17   7  90
4  18  82  36  65   4   9  87
5  11  91  79  39  44  19   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will first observe the valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, not every agent will receive the same number of items, but we'll strive for a distribution that seems equitable based on their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for item 6 (91).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 5 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 1 (87).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 0 (84).
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 3 (65).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation for item 2 (79).

This leaves item 4, which can be fairly allocated to an agent who has received fewer total items based on their remaining valuation. Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 4 (68), so we can allocate item 4 to agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and the assignments reflect the preferences of the agents as much as possible given the constraints.
