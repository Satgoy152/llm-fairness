Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  19  46  53  94  73  96
1  38  85  74  64  37  60  82
2  66  65   1  88  23  32  16
3  37  46  52  20  28  17  74
4  15  28  26  25  43  99   5
5  68  39  37  48  78  15  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. We can aim to maximize the total valuation of the agents while ensuring a fair distribution of items.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 seems to have high valuations for several items. Let's assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 1, so we'll assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly, so we'll assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 has a relatively high valuation for item 6, so we'll assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 5, so we'll assign item 5 to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 0, so we'll assign item 0 to Agent 5.
- The remaining item 2 can be assigned to Agent 0 as well, who has a moderate valuation for it.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```
