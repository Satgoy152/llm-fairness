Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  28  53  83  34  13  70
1  45  19  59  60  97  23  95
2  86  58  28  38  15  92   2
3  95  19  66  98  70   1  30
4  28  28  15  30  45  37  94
5  39  12  14  29  54  89  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute them in a way that is as equitable as possible. We'll try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 98.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 with a value of 97.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 with a value of 92.
4. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6 with a value of 70.
5. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0 with a value of 86 (after other high values are allocated).
6. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2 with a value of 59.
7. Agent 4, with no allocations yet, can be given item 1.

Based on these selections, we can define the allocations as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items each agent receives while also considering their highest valuations.
