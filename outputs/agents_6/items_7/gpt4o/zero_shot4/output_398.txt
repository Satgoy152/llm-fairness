Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  36  92  34  87  22  87
1  45  24  27  42  94  21  35
2  59   4  12  83  33  17  89
3  47  24   2   8  65  18  76
4  88  68  55  88  37  60   1
5  49  92  67  50  95  19  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and exactly 7 items are allocated in total. 

Let's analyze the table and allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is on item 2 (92), allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is on item 4 (94), allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is on item 6 (89), allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is on item 6 (76), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 4 (65), but it's also taken. Next is item 0 (47), allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is on item 0 (88), but it's already taken by agent 3, so allocate their next highest, item 3 (88).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is on item 4 (95), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 1 (92), allocate item 1 to agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item to ensure each agent has at least one item, and all 7 items are used:

7. **Remaining item is 5**. Agent 4 can take item 5, as it has a higher value for it (60) compared to other agents.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.
