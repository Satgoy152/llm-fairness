Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  88  46  15  38  25  80
1  40  43   4  60  91  18  69
2  30  28  83  87   9  37  63
3  54  27  35  61  52  39  11
4   0  95  78  77  43  74  81
5  22  96  45  24  65  38  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed. Since there are more items than agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item. 

Here's a possible allocation that fairly distributes the items based on their valuations:

1. Start by identifying which agents value which items the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's make a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (88).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (91).
- Agent 2 highly values item 3 (87).
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 (54).
- Agent 4 highly values item 5 (74).
- Agent 5 highly values item 2 (96).

Now, one item remains (6), and we need to find a fair way to allocate it to a deserving agent based on their remaining high valuation.

- Agent 4 also highly values item 6 (81).

Given this, we can distribute the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated. Agent 4 receives two items due to their relatively high valuations for those items.
