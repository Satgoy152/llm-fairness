Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  97  68  23   5  45  87
1  41  83  78  93  51  27  67
2   1  15  11  96  60  53  64
3  26  24  93  74  11  47  79
4  57  61   5  90  52  95  40
5  44  66  93  59  27  46  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item when possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify agents' highest-value items to allocate them fairly.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, to ensure fairness.
3. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the perceived value for agents.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 1 (97) and 6 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 3 (93) and 2 (78).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 3 (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 2 (93).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 5 (95).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 2 (93).

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 4

Now, every agent except Agent 0 has exactly one item. Agent 0 gets another item (Item 0), as it has the next highest perceived value for Agent 0.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and attempts to maximize the utility for each agent based on their perceived values.
