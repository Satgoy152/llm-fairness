Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  97  59  32  47  99  64
1  41  80  98  31   1  82  84
2  28  92  21  36  42  94   1
3  28  70  76  83  20  81  38
4  19  36  46   4  47  39  85
5  41  22  48  28  22   9  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Begin by looking at the highest valuations for each item across all agents.

2. **Allocate Unique Highest Valuations**: Initially allocate items to agents who value them the most, provided there's no conflict (i.e., an agent having the highest valuation for multiple items).

3. **Resolve Conflicts**: If conflicts arise (e.g., an agent has the highest valuation for more than one item), prioritize based on the next highest valuation for those items or distribute remaining items to agents with fewer allocations.

4. **Equal Distribution**: Ensure no one agent gets significantly more items than another unless justified by valuation.

Here's one possible fair allocation based on the table:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a score of 85.
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a score of 97.
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a score of 98.
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with a score of 83.
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a score of 47.
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a score of 99.
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 with a score of 85.

After resolving the above conflicts and distributing the remaining items, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and no agent receives an unfair advantage based on their valuation preferences.
