Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  87  31  99  96   9  17
1  64  16   1  17  12  32  56
2  23  81  95  25  53  83  42
3  34  74  42  84  33  44  77
4  60  74  66  60  55  98  88
5  54  40  14  64  68  61  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
2. Agent 1 does not have any high valuations compared to others, but item 6 is relatively higher.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3. However, since agent 0 already has a high valuation for item 3, let's consider their next best option, which is item 6.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 5.
6. Agent 5 values item 6 highly, but since it is already allocated, consider item 4.

Now, let's assign the items based on the above observations:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 4

Now we have assigned 6 items. Let's assign the remaining item, item 1, to the agent who would benefit the most from it, which is Agent 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
