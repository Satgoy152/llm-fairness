Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  29   0  99  19  84  94
1   5  85   7   6  98  53   7
2  13  13  62  44  90  50  57
3  94  37  21  84  93  47  67
4  71  52  18  37  95  89  15
5  87   8  84  49  73  80  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's approach this by looking at the highest valued items for each agent and trying to distribute them in a manner that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (99) and item 6 (94).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4 (98) and item 1 (85).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 4 (90) and item 2 (62).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 0 (94) and item 4 (93).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 4 (95) and item 5 (89).
6. Agent 5 highly values item 0 (87) and item 2 (84).

Our goal is to allocate these items such that each agent gets at least one high-value item and the total allocation covers all 7 items.

Let's try the following allocation:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (Agent 2's second-highest after item 4, which is already allocated).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (second highest after item 4, which is already allocated).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 5 (Agent 5's second-highest after item 0, which is already allocated).

Now, each agent has 1 item, and all 7 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
