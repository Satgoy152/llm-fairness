Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  92  40  80  66  16  64
1  34  53  74  20  45  48   4
2  84  30  38  50  91  96  21
3  39  56  88  80  61  32  65
4  93  60  10  51   3   8  95
5   4  15  61  57  90  29  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value that each agent receives. Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, each agent might not receive exactly one item. Here is a possible allocation that tries to distribute the items based on the highest valuations:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (value 93).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 92).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value 88).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 80).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 5 (value 90).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 96).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 95).

This allocation seeks to distribute the items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
