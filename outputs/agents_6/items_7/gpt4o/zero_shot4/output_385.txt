Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  71  66   4  58  25  82
1   7  16  44  59  56  72  97
2  91  82  42  62  87  21  77
3  41  80  33  15  72  27  19
4  35  88  34  58  61  76  80
5  23  27  46  41  34   3  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize their total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are assigned. Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: 6 (value 82)
   - Allocated item: 6

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: 6 (value 97)
   - But item 6 is already allocated. Next highest: 5 (value 72)
   - Allocated item: 5

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: 0 (value 91)
   - Allocated item: 0

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: 1 (value 80)
   - Allocated item: 1

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value item: 1 (value 88)
   - But item 1 is already allocated. Next highest: 4 (value 61)
   - Allocated item: 4

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest value item: 2 (value 46)
   - Allocated item: 2

Remaining item: 3

Now, we have one item left (item 3) that hasn't been allocated yet. Let's review the allocations to distribute this last item fairly:

- Agent 1 has only one item. Item 3 has a value of 59 for Agent 1, which is significant. Thus, we will allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
