Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  41  86  58  77  84  33
1   4  55  97  55  75  44  59
2  72  99  11  44  74  47  18
3  41  79  53  29  28  60  97
4  10  50  89  37  21  33  51
5   9   3  46  17  64  50  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the total utility for the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Each agent does not necessarily need to receive an item, but all items must be allocated among the agents.

One possible way to fairly allocate the items is by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 2 and 5. Assign items 0 and 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 1 and 4. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 2, but it's taken. Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (next available highest value).
6. **Agent 5**: No item allocated initially. Assign item 3 to Agent 5 to ensure all items are distributed.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering the highest values for each agent.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and attempts to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.
