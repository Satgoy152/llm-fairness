Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  44  81   5  48  66   6
1  93  10  50  74  33  13  40
2  38  90  15  95  75  20  46
3  72  61  43  88  56  27  28
4   6  97  41  47  78   5  69
5  39  70  96  79  16  81  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their preferences. A common approach is to use a method like the "maximum marginal utility" or "envy-free" allocation, which ensures that no agent feels another agent is better off given the allocation.

The given values of each agent for each item are as follows:

```
Agent 0: [30, 44, 81, 5, 48, 66, 6]
Agent 1: [93, 10, 50, 74, 33, 13, 40]
Agent 2: [38, 90, 15, 95, 75, 20, 46]
Agent 3: [72, 61, 43, 88, 56, 27, 28]
Agent 4: [6, 97, 41, 47, 78, 5, 69]
Agent 5: [39, 70, 96, 79, 16, 81, 99]
```

Let's proceed with allocating the items such that the total number of items allocated is 7 and each agent has an integer number of items:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (93), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 4 highly values item 1 (97), so allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
3. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (81), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (95), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
5. Agent 5 highly values item 5 (81), so allocate item 5 to Agent 5.
6. Agent 5 also places the highest value on item 6 (99), so allocate item 6 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 3 values item 4 (56), so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
