Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  91  57  77  51  17  28
1  68   7  58   8  72  67  97
2   9  17  55  28  79  62  31
3  32  43  50  30  58  55  43
4  61  70  30   8  37  50  17
5   4  63  94  45  97  55  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the others will receive one item each.

A possible approach is to assign each agent one of their highest valued items, ensuring that each item is assigned exactly once. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (91), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (97), so assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (79), so assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most (58), but it's already taken by agent 2. The next highest value is item 2 (50), so assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most (70), but it's already taken by agent 0. The next highest value is item 0 (61), so assign item 0 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the most (97), but it's already taken by agent 2. The next highest value is item 2 (94), but it's already taken by agent 3. The next highest is item 6 (68), but it's already taken by agent 1. Therefore, assign the next highest value item 5 (55) to agent 5.
7. Now, agent 2 has only one item, and agent 5 has one item. The remaining item, item 3, should be assigned to one of these agents. Agent 5 values item 3 (45) more than agent 2 (28), so assign item 3 to agent 5.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 3]
}
```
