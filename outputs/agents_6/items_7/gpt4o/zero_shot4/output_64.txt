Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  79  74  71  16  39  53
1  80  47  16  21  37  78   7
2  82  16  76  31   3  49  54
3  95  25  85  92  14   8  95
4  83  25  78  62  47  81   0
5  75  78   7  53  87  54  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. We will start by allocating the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Since there are more items than agents, we will then allocate the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's begin the allocation:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 the most at 79.
- Agent 1 values Item 0 the most at 80.
- Agent 2 values Item 0 the most at 82.
- Agent 3 values Item 0 the most at 95.
- Agent 4 values Item 0 the most at 83.
- Agent 5 values Item 4 the most at 87.

Now, these allocations would initially conflict because some items are preferred by multiple agents. We must resolve these conflicts. 

Here's how we can resolve this:

1. **Assign each agent their unique highest-value item**:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 5.

2. **Allocate remaining items based on next highest unique values**:
   - Agent 3 gets Item 0 (95).
   - Agent 2 gets Item 2 (76).
   - Agent 4 gets Item 5 (81).
   - Agent 1 gets Item 6 (78).

3. **Allocate the remaining item (Item 3) to the agent who values it most and hasn't received an item yet**:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3 (71) because they value it second highest after Item 1.

This allocation ensures each agent gets the highest possible value from the items they receive while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
