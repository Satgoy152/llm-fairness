Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  18  93   3  71  17  27
1   8  25  72  50  22  78  39
2  72  34  32  91   6  68  68
3  84  86  39  35  21  93  58
4   6  72  21  38  35  53  56
5  54  28   8  97  66   2  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. We aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

One approach is the following:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If any agent is assigned more items than others, redistribute the least valued items to agents with fewer items while ensuring that the total number of assigned items remains 7.

Using this approach, the item allocations can be as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2 (93)
- Agent 1: Items 5 (78)
- Agent 2: Items 3 (91)
- Agent 3: Items 1 (86)
- Agent 4: Items 6 (56)
- Agent 5: Items 0 (54), 4 (66)

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```
