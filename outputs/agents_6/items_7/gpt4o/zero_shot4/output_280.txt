Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  93  81  45  17  42   4
1  18  25  69  90  14  44  91
2  95  55  56  94  85  51  81
3   2  25  99  41  55  67  71
4  32   7  42  55  34  85  31
5  75  26  67  41  89  85  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives. We can use a simple greedy strategy by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each item is allocated to one agent only. Here's how the allocation works:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values item 0 the most at 95.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 the most at 93.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 99.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 90.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 5 values item 4 the most at 89.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values item 5 the most at 85.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values item 6 the most at 91.

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent may receive two items.

Assigning based on the maximum valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 6
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 4

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
