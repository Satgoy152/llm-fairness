Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  52  36  62  33  28  67
1  30  24  48  75   6   8  19
2  57  96  67  24  99  86  30
3  96  50  94  75  31  94  30
4   6  71  17  18  78  31   6
5  21  42  62  44  23  62  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives at least one item if possible and that the allocation is based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the highest at 67.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most at 75.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest at 99.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most at 96.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 the highest at 71.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 the most at 62.

These items are all unique, so we've assigned one item to each agent based on their highest valuation. Now, we have one item left to allocate (item 5).

Let's find the agent who would benefit the most by receiving item 5:

- **Agent 0** values item 5 at 28.
- **Agent 1** values item 5 at 8.
- **Agent 2** values item 5 at 86.
- **Agent 3** values item 5 at 94.
- **Agent 4** values item 5 at 31.
- **Agent 5** values item 5 at 62.

Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 94. So, item 5 will be allocated to agent 3.

Now, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, with the distribution based on maximizing each agent's valuation of the items they receive.
