Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  51  51  62  20  40  62
1  87  91  94  76  19  25  18
2  33  43  31   1  69  15  63
3  28  20  90  36  90  88  21
4  79  65  64  34  56  91  48
5   2  82  87  72  25  15  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. A common strategy is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Given there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Values: [75, 51, 51, 62, 20, 40, 62]
   - Highest value: 75 for item 0

2. Agent 1:
   - Values: [87, 91, 94, 76, 19, 25, 18]
   - Highest value: 94 for item 2

3. Agent 2:
   - Values: [33, 43, 31, 1, 69, 15, 63]
   - Highest value: 69 for item 4

4. Agent 3:
   - Values: [28, 20, 90, 36, 90, 88, 21]
   - Highest value: 90 for item 2 (already taken), next 90 for item 4 (already taken), then 88 for item 5

5. Agent 4:
   - Values: [79, 65, 64, 34, 56, 91, 48]
   - Highest value: 91 for item 5 (already taken), next 79 for item 0 (already taken), then 65 for item 1

6. Agent 5:
   - Values: [2, 82, 87, 72, 25, 15, 81]
   - Highest value: 87 for item 2 (already taken), next 82 for item 1 (already taken), then 81 for item 6

Now, based on the above observations, allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [2,6]

Here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2,6]
}
```
