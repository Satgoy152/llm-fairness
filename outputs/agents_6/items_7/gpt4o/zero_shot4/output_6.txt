Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  43  74  97  17  63  90
1  26  59  97  64  76  50  12
2  48  75  40  90  90  16  48
3  14  14  41  91   4  16  93
4  83  36  23  31  83  11  94
5   4  81  48  55  38  32  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. One approach is to aim for a distribution where each agent gets items they value highly while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent is considered.

To achieve this, we'll try to assign items based on the highest valuation for each item while ensuring no agent is left out and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Let's go through the table and allocate items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 83 by agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 81 by agent 5.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 97 by agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 97 by agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 90 by agents 2 and 3. We can assign it to agent 2 for balance.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 63 by agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 94 by agent 4.

Let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item. Based on the above, agent 3 hasn't received any item. We can reassign item 6 to agent 3 since agent 4 has already received an item. 

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures every agent is considered, each item is allocated, and the distribution is based on the highest valuations where possible while maintaining fairness.
