Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  19  31   7  33  16  15
1  75  53  76  71  83  21  70
2  66  55  14  90  58  46  73
3  27  10  94  30  29  50   1
4  16  99  69  83  21   2  43
5   3  23  63   0  71   5  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuation, we can use a greedy approach by assigning items to agents who value them the most, ensuring no agent gets more than the necessary number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 83).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 90).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value 94).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 99).
5. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value 73).
6. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 75).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 50).

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value highly.
