Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  70  65  36  22  53   2
1  34   4  14  66  10  21  93
2  61  96  71  68  92  21  22
3  47  66  77  57  87  22   2
4  40  94  92  20  52   5  92
5  90  37  62  25  73  51  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 70 65 36 22 53  2]
 [34  4 14 66 10 21 93]
 [61 96 71 68 92 21 22]
 [47 66 77 57 87 22  2]
 [40 94 92 20 52  5 92]
 [90 37 62 25 73 51 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. We'll assign the items based on each agent's highest valuation for the available items.

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (94), so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (93), so we assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (96), so we assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (87), so we assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (92), so we assign item 2 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (51), so we assign item 5 to agent 5.
7. Now, we have one item left to allocate, item 3. We can assign it to any agent who values it next highest. Agent 1 values item 3 at 66, which is the highest among the remaining unallocated items for agent 1. Therefore, we assign item 3 to agent 1.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```
