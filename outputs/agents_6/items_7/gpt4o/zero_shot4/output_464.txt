Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74   5   3  92   4  72  40
1  79  75  75  13  24  34  45
2  98  31  61  32  89  76  38
3  26  78  45  99  16   3  48
4   5  10  52  40  38  94  69
5  58  95  53  69  62  42  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74  5  3 92  4 72 40]
 [79 75 75 13 24 34 45]
 [98 31 61 32 89 76 38]
 [26 78 45 99 16  3 48]
 [ 5 10 52 40 38 94 69]
 [58 95 53 69 62 42 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 3 (value 92)
2. Agent 1: Item 2 (value 75)
3. Agent 2: Item 4 (value 89)
4. Agent 3: Item 1 (value 78)
5. Agent 4: Item 5 (value 94)
6. Agent 5: Item 6 (value 76)
7. Agent 2: Item 0 (value 98)

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and the total allocation is optimal based on the given values. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
