Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  82  43  15  49  83  39
1  93  89  15   5  31  42  95
2  50  79  23  58  98  13  81
3  99  64  69  79  55  44  71
4  69  25  27  77  94  33   8
5  45  98  38  29  82  52  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, a reasonable approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. We can attempt to allocate items in a way that each agent gets one item and the allocation maximizes the total value for each agent.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing individual agent's values for items:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most (value of 83), so assign item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (value of 95), so assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (value of 98), so assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (value of 99), so assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the most (value of 77), so assign item 3 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 the most (value of 98), so assign item 1 to agent 5.
7. Item 2 remains unallocated. Looking at the remaining values, agent 3 has the next highest unallocated value for item 2 (value of 69), so assign item 2 to agent 3.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated based on maximizing individual valuations.
