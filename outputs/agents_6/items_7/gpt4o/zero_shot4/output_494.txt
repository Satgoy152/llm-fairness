Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  23  17  84  76  80  72
1  62  53   0  30  98  11  42
2  23   9  59  32  77  83   1
3   7  48  51  45  37  85   4
4  32  50  46  30  21  72  74
5  90  69  34  55  61  53  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is as even as possible based on their valuations. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent with the items they receive. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, adjusting as necessary to ensure fairness.

The initial allocation based on highest valuation for each item is as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most at 90.
- Item 1: Agent 5 values it the most at 69.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 59.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 85.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most at 74.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is fair:

- Agent 0 currently has item 3.
- Agent 1 currently has item 4.
- Agent 2 currently has item 2.
- Agent 3 currently has item 5.
- Agent 4 currently has item 6.
- Agent 5 currently has items 0 and 1.

To ensure fairness, we can reallocate such that each agent gets one item:

- Item 0 remains with Agent 5.
- Item 1 can be reassigned to Agent 4, who has item 6, swapping it with Agent 5.
- Item 2 remains with Agent 2.
- Item 3 remains with Agent 0.
- Item 4 remains with Agent 1.
- Item 5 remains with Agent 3.
- Item 6 goes to Agent 5.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item.
