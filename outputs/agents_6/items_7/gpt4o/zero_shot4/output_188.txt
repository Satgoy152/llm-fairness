Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  32  33  93  32  96  68
1  71  47   5  47   1  25  84
2  19  45  69  28  36  32  42
3  14  38  77  38  95  63  74
4  64  81  39  61  35  64  33
5  80  35  47  98  41  10  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and every item is allocated to one of the agents. We will use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on the highest valuations.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for item 5 (96) and item 3 (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (71).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (69).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (95).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (81).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (98), but it's already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 0 (80).

To ensure all items are allocated without duplication and each agent is considered fairly, we can assign:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 6 (adding one more item to Agent 5 to ensure all items are allocated)

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```
