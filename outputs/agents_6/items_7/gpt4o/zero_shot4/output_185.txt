Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  81  12  65  15  92  95
1  41  36   3  54  62  30  62
2  90  85  85   2  85   0   0
3  61  88  95  52  83  62   8
4  88  83  77  88  98  54  79
5  47  76  52  11  23  11  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we have 6 agents and 7 items, so one agent will have to receive 2 items while the others receive 1 each.

Let's try to allocate items based on the highest valuation per agent without repeating items:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 6.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 0.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 2.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 4 (but it's already taken by Agent 1), so we give them item 3.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 6 (but it's already taken by Agent 0), so we give them item 1.
7. We have allocated 6 items; one item remains unallocated. We need to assign an additional item to one of the agents. Agent 4 has the highest remaining valuation for an unallocated item, so we assign item 5 to them.

Here's one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
