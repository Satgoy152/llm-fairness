Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33   7  74  98  90  20  96
1  28  82  79  85  60  80  36
2  45  36   9  33  97  27  12
3   2  67  68  20  28  43   3
4  64  71  22  74   1  34  66
5  65  91  19  92  44  82  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a simple greedy approach where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given table:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 5 has the highest valuation of 65.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 5.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 5 has the highest valuation of 91.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 5.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 74.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 98.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 97.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 5 has the highest valuation of 82.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 5.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 96.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated to the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, and maximizing the total valuation for each item.
