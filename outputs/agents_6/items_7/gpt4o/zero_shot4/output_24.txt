Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  33  96  68  85  76  63
1  96   4  70  30  27  70  55
2  23  75   9   1  83  63  40
3  18  42  69  19  50  72  18
4  35  33  80  13  72  55  65
5  21  43  89  27  40   8  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. A common approach is to use a method like the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, where one set of nodes represents agents and the other set represents items, with edges weighted by the agents' valuations of the items.

Let's proceed with a solution:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for item 2 (96).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for item 0 (96).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for item 1 (75).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for item 5 (72).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for item 4 (72).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for item 3 (27).
7. **Agent 3**: Next highest available item for agent 3 is item 6 (18).

This allocation attempts to maximize fairness by giving each agent at least one of their higher valued items where possible, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```
