Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24   2  25  18  30  12  51
1  64  11  70  87  73  11  89
2  98  61  79  18  49  51  67
3  52  73  72  92  57  42   4
4  46  87  19  33   9  72  50
5  39  18  29  28  80  52  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. This approach is often referred to as the "maximum sum" allocation. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Allocate each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item. This ensures that the total value derived from the allocation is maximized.

3. **Handle Ties if Necessary**: If two agents have the same highest valuation for an item, decide based on remaining capacity or a fair tie-breaking rule.

Now, applying this approach to the given table:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (98).
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (87).
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (70).
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (92).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 5 (80).
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (72).
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (89).

Assign these items to the respective agents:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
