Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  78  55  97  66  16  26
1  29  81  47  92  36  55  30
2   6  13  33  61  43  58  71
3   7  96  83   1  25  77  42
4  82  16  88  54  57  20  73
5  58  74  78  67  22   5  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy that focuses on maximizing each agent's satisfaction. This can be done by iterating over the items and assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that every agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Examine the valuations for each item and assign the item to the agent with the highest value for that item.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, redistributing if necessary to meet this condition.

Let's go through the valuations and make the allocations:

- Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 4 (82).
- Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 3 (96).
- Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 4 (88).
- Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 0 (97).
- Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 0 (66).
- Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 3 (77).
- Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 2 (71).

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [1, 5]
- Agent 4: [0, 2]
- Agent 5: []

Adjustments to ensure fairness:
- Move item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 to ensure Agent 1 receives an item.
- Move item 5 from Agent 3 to Agent 5 to ensure Agent 5 receives an item.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [0, 2]
- Agent 5: [5]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [5]
}
```
