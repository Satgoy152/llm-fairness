Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  57  43  98  19  86  38
1  56  73  45  98  27  42  81
2   5  56  32   0  29  81  14
3  41  29  31  32  61  41  76
4  62  28  46  64  83  40  95
5  65  21  70  94  99  11  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach is to start by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and that all items are allocated. 

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the most at 98.
2. **Agent 1**: Also values item 3 the most at 98, but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 1 at 73.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the most at 81.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the most at 76.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 the most at 95, but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 4 at 83.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 4 the most at 99, but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 3 at 94, but it's already assigned. Next is item 2 at 70.

Now, let's allocate the unassigned items, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, and all items are assigned:

7. **Unassigned items**: 0, 2
   - **Agent 5**: Assign item 2 (Next highest value at 70)
   - **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (Highest remaining value at 61)

Now, every agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. 

Here is the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
