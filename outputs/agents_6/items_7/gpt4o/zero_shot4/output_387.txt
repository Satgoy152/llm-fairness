Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  21  86  19  37  41  24
1  24  42  11  95  37  67  52
2  47  69  44  15  91  60  75
3  46   3  67  55  88  58  91
4  84  76  62  45  61  90  30
5   1  98  61  19  86  94   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocations.

Let's assess the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations for item 2 (86).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 3 (95).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations include item 4 (91).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High valuation for item 6 (91).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - High valuation for item 0 (84).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - High valuation for item 1 (98).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 5.

At this point, each agent has one item, and six items have been allocated. We have one item left to allocate:

- The remaining item is item 5. Its highest remaining valuation is by Agent 5 (94), but since Agent 5 already has a high-valued item (item 1), let's consider spreading satisfaction:
  - Agent 4 also has a high valuation for item 5 (90).
  - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated all 7 items. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
