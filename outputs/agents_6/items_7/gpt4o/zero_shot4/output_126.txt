Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  92  66  70  92  21   6
1  25  74  85  98   9   7  39
2  56  21  24  99  52  72  10
3  65  40   1  84  70  14  19
4  22  23  57  76  25  59   9
5  77  56  42  88  60  90  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since we need to allocate all 7 items, and we have 6 agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

One way to approach this is to try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item until all items are allocated. This can be done through a simple greedy algorithm, starting with the highest valuation for each item and assigning it to the corresponding agent.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it has the highest valuation (99).
2. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as it has the highest valuation (92).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 5, as it has the highest valuation (77).
4. Assign item 5 to agent 5, as it has the highest valuation (90).
5. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as it has the highest valuation (92).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as it has the highest valuation (85).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as it has the highest valuation (39).

The allocations can be represented in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives no items.
- Agent 4 receives no items.
- Agent 5 receives items 0 and 5.

This distribution maximizes the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
