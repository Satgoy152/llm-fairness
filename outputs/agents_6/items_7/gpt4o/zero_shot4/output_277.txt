Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  21  70  97  80  80  35
1  91  64  31  90  22  93  82
2  50  48   3  93  48   9  25
3  16  74  34  40  47  14  95
4  17  78  39  46  13  25  30
5  26  96  30  99  95   8  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 64 31 90 22 93 82]
 [50 48  3 93 48  9 25]

 [17 78 39 46 13 25 30]
 [26 96 30 99 95  8 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that exactly 7 items are allocated in total. Given the valuations, one approach is to use a method that considers the agents' preferences and attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a potential allocation based on the given data:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as they have a high valuation (93).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as they have a high valuation (91).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 1, as they have a high valuation (93).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 5, as they have a high valuation (95).
5. Assign item 1 to agent 5, as they have a high valuation (96).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as they have a high valuation (70).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 3, as they have a high valuation (95).

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly, while also ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 4]
}
```
