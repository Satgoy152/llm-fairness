Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  84  61   4  62  58  58
1  90  86  59  79  13  18   1
2  73  40  10  66  34  84  40
3  32  24  26  20  33   1  10
4   8  21  30  16  77  45  31
5  40  23  38  80  87  43  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they value highly. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (87). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (90), but it is already assigned. Their next highest is item 1 (86). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest (84). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has low values across the board, but their highest is item 4 (33). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest (77), but it's already assigned. Their next highest is item 5 (45), but it's also assigned. Next is item 6 (31). Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 4 the highest (87), but it's already assigned. Their next highest is item 3 (80). Assign item 3 to Agent 5.

This leaves item 2 unassigned. The highest remaining valuation for item 2 is from Agent 0 (61), but to balance the distribution, let's consider other agents who may not have received their highest preferences:

7. **Agent 0** has items 0, 1, and 2 as their highest preferences. Since items 0 and 1 are already assigned, assign item 2 to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocation and ensure all items are assigned:

- Items assigned: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (all items assigned).
- Agents have been allocated as fairly as possible.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```
