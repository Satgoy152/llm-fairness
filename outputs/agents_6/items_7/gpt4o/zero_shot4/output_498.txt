Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  59  47  63  44  76  16
1  46  41  42   5  62  89  13
2  13  45  43  23  90  33  29
3  57  19  85   2  98  65  47
4  58  89  69   9  66  57   1
5  42  42  73  12  37  65  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations. We will try to ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, while also ensuring that each item is allocated.

Based on the table provided, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most (76).
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most (89).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (90).
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most (98).
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most (89).
6. Agent 5 values item 2 the most (73).

Now, let's prioritize the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (highest value for agent 1, and agent 0 can be assigned other items).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for agent 3).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (highest value for agent 4).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (highest value for agent 5).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (remaining high value for agent 0).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (remaining item with relatively high value for agent 2).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (remaining unallocated item).

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```
