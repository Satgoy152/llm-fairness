Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  11  80  60  75  40  52
1  34  31   6  10  44  38  13
2  43  30  19  57  15  47  18
3   4  36  56  65  70  88  71
4  61  33  87  53  43  25  44
5   5  14   1  13  60  85   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll try to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item or is left with none, and exactly 7 items are allocated in total. Here's one way to do it:

1. Start by evaluating which items have the highest individual values for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents such that their total valuation is maximized.
3. Ensure each item is assigned only once and each agent either receives items or none at all.

Based on the table provided, the following allocation could be considered fair:

- Agent 0 will get item 2, which has the highest value for any agent.
- Agent 3 will get item 5, which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 4 will get item 0, which is the highest value for them.
- Agent 5 will get item 4, which is the best available option for them.

Let's allocate the remaining items to maximize the distribution:

- Assign item 3 to agent 3 since they value it highly.
- Assign item 6 to agent 3 as well, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it's a reasonable allocation given available options.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 5, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned only once, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
