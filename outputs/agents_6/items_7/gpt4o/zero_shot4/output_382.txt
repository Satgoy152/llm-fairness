Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  34  55   6  45  84  74
1  57  68  32  32  34  39  98
2  49  39  54  25  24  77  61
3  60  32  34  57  78  56   3
4  79  85  33  65  63  99  67
5  66  74  39  98  12  44  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in such a way that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying high-value items for each agent.
2. Try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Balance the total values by considering the remaining items.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 84)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (value 98)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 54)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (value 78)
- Agent 4: Items 1 and 3 (values 85 and 65)
- Agent 5: Item 0 (value 66)

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on the items' values. Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
