Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  22  33  86  20  49  39
1  79  98  94  48  96  71  15
2  75  97  52  15  93  20  83
3  92  77  14  72  72  80  18
4  98  61   4  12  86  33   8
5  69  71  55  43  87  87  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. We will aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that are most valuable to them while ensuring all items are assigned.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't reached their maximum allocation of items yet. However, since we have 6 agents and 7 items, at least one agent will get more than one item, which we can determine by testing different combinations.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values item 0 the most with a value of 98.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values item 1 the most with a value of 98.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values item 2 the most with a value of 94.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values item 3 the most with a value of 86.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values item 4 the most with a value of 96.
- Item 5: Agent 5 values item 5 the most with a value of 87.
- Item 6: Agent 5 values item 6 the most with a value of 99.

Now, we need to adjust the allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total items allocated are 7.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [2, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent gets the items they value highly. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
