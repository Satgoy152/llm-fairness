Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  65  29   5  58   5  18
1  37  56  38  67   6  82  99
2  61  90  37  18   5  96  47
3   1  13  83  99  29  70  52
4  42  76  31  12  21  10  38
5  41  99  22  68  16  31  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items based on the highest value that each agent assigns to the available items, ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Assign the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (65).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the most (99).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most (96).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (99).
   - Agent 4 values item 1 the most (76).
   - Agent 5 values item 1 the most (99).

2. **Adjust allocations to ensure every item is uniquely assigned:**
   - Based on the above, item 1 is highly valued by Agents 0, 4, and 5. Assign it to the agent who has the next highest unique preference for a different item.
   - Agents 0 can be assigned item 0 (18), freeing item 1 for another agent.
   - Agent 4 can be assigned item 4 (21).
   - Agent 5 can be assigned item 2 (22).

3. **Final allocation taking into account all items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0
   - Item 1: Agent 4
   - Item 2: Agent 5
   - Item 3: Agent 3
   - Item 4: Agent 4
   - Item 5: Agent 2
   - Item 6: Agent 1

Based on these steps, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
