Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  79  47  43  70   6  16
1  89  75   9  90  79  33  48
2  64   9  51   1  23  51  86
3  56  91  83  13   3  69  73
4  24  26  91  55  45  56   0
5  62  26  89  18  15  64  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. The key is to ensure that each agent values their allocation highly, minimizing potential envy.

Let's follow a simple allocation method, like the "maximum marginal gain" approach, where each agent gets the item they value most highly in each round until all items are allocated. However, given the constraints of exactly 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will end up with two items. We will prioritize items based on their highest valuation from the agents.

### Step 1: Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 89
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 91
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most at 91
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 90
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 70
- Item 5: Agent 5 values it the most at 64
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 86

### Step 2: Allocate Items
Start by giving each agent their top choice based on the highest valuation above:

- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (89)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (91)
- **Agent 4**: Item 2 (91)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (90) (Additional allocation due to highest bid)
- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (70)
- **Agent 5**: Item 5 (64)
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 (86)

### Step 3: Final Allocation
Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no overlaps beyond the 7-item constraint. Since Agent 1 has the second-highest valuation for another item (Item 3), they receive two items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the item they value the most, making the division as fair as possible under the given constraints.
