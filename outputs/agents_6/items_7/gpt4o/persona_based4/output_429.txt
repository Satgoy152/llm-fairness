Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  50  91  35  17  70   7
1   3  76  71  31  86  40  36
2  44  39  70  63  35   2  12
3  70  39  46  97  30  23  15
4  39  58  71  50  20  78  29
5  14   3  43  49  25  29  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to try and achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, where each agent values their own allocation as at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given we have 6 agents and 7 items, some agents may receive more items than others, but we will try to ensure that no agent feels significantly envious of another's allocation.

Here's a step-by-step plan to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Start by identifying which items each agent values the most.

2. **Assign High-Value Items**: Attempt to assign the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Balance Remaining Items**: After initial allocation, distribute remaining items to agents who have received fewer items or whose allocations are valued lower by them.

4. **Adjust for Envy-Freeness**: Reallocate if any agent has significantly lower total value compared to others, within the constraints of having integer numbers of items.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Highest Valuation Assignments**:
   - Agent 0's highest value is for item 2 (91), assign it to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's highest value is for item 4 (86), assign it to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2's highest value is for item 2, but it's taken, so assign next highest item 3 (63) to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3's highest value is item 3, but it's taken, so assign next highest item 0 (70) to Agent 3.
   - Agent 4's highest value is item 5 (78), assign it to Agent 4.
   - Agent 5's highest value is item 6 (75), assign it to Agent 5.

2. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 1 is left, assign it to Agent 1 as they have a high valuation for it (76).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences while maintaining fairness as much as possible.
