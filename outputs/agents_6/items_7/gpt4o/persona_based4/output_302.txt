Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  26  95  43  99  92  91
1  63  33  89  70  41  43  60
2  77  40  99  63  79  61  11
3   8  26  80  78  27  26  94
4  27  45  68  50  80  75   3
5   9  84  79  96  27   9  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an approach like the "round-robin" method or a modified version of the "maximum marginal utility." The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent envies another, meaning each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process using a modified version of the "maximum marginal utility" approach:

1. **Initialize:** Start with all agents unallocated and all items unallocated.
2. **Allocation Process:**
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most and allocate it to that agent.
   - Ensure that each agent gets at most one more item than any other agent to maintain fairness.

Let's assign the items based on the given valuations:

- **Item 0:** Highest value is for agent 0 (91). Assign to agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Highest value is for agent 5 (84). Assign to agent 5.
- **Item 2:** Highest value is for agent 2 (99). Assign to agent 2.
- **Item 3:** Highest value is for agent 5 (96). Assign to agent 5.
- **Item 4:** Highest value is for agent 0 (99). Assign to agent 0.
- **Item 5:** Highest value is for agent 0 (92). Assign to agent 0.
- **Item 6:** Highest value is for agent 3 (94). Assign to agent 3.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's value based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated. Each agent receives items in a manner that reflects their highest valuations, helping to maintain envy-freeness to the extent possible given the integer constraints.
