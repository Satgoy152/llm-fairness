Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  59  54  37  63   4  57
1  43  28  11  75  73  63  24
2  31   3  89  15  10  49  53
3  97  29  26  25  89  78   4
4  14  38  80  28  48  52  12
5  19  99  34  56  55   4  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers the preferences of each agent as represented by their valuations. A common approach is to use a round-robin method where each agent in sequence picks the most valued item still available, or use an algorithmic approach like the "Adjusted Winner" or "Envy Graph" technique. However, given the simplicity and the discrete nature of the problem (integer allocation), a manual approach balancing valuations is appropriate here.

Let's proceed with a simplified method:

1. **Identify the most valued items for each agent.**
2. **Assign items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and distribute high-value items according to preferences.**

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest available valuations:

- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (97). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 1 (99). Assign item 1 to Agent 5.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (89). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (75). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4 (89). Since Agent 3 already has item 0, assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5 (63). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 6 (69). Since Agent 5 already has item 1, assign item 6 to Agent 5.

Now, let's check our allocations ensuring all items are assigned and every agent is considered:

- Agent 0: No items allocated, as their highest preference items were claimed by others.
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 4: No items allocated, as their preferences were lower.
- Agent 5: Items [1, 6]

Presenting these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and attempts to align with each agent's highest valuations to promote fairness.
