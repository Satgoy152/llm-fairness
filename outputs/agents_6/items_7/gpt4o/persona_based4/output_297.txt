Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  92  30  20  56  49  71
1  64   2  99  24  82  12  68
2  15  81  25  84  81  61  59
3  20  39   2  23  62  25  67
4  65  39   3  59  34  34  18
5  40  22  99  37  83  74   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers the preferences of the agents as expressed in their valuations. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuation.

Here is one possible allocation that adheres to the constraints:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent and try to allocate those items if possible.
2. Ensure that the total number of allocated items equals 7, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Based on the given valuations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 and 1 the highest. Allocating these to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest. Allocating item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 and item 1 highly. However, item 1 is already allocated, so allocate item 3.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest. Allocating item 6 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest, but it’s already allocated. Allocate item 4.
- Agent 5 values item 2 the highest, but it’s already allocated. Allocate item 5.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, all 7 items have been allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, with the allocation attempting to respect the highest valuations where possible.
