Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  20  41  77  28  76  75
1  51   3  24  98  10  66  53
2  46  97  79  26  76  96  12
3  83  67  14  51  95  18  58
4  68  75  18  99  38  57  57
5  55  72  79  38  23  93   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. We have 6 agents and 7 items, which means one agent will receive an extra item. Let's approach this by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives, thereby attempting to minimize envy.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
0: [95, 20, 41, 77, 28, 76, 75]
1: [51, 3, 24, 98, 10, 66, 53]
2: [46, 97, 79, 26, 76, 96, 12]
3: [83, 67, 14, 51, 95, 18, 58]
4: [68, 75, 18, 99, 38, 57, 57]
5: [55, 72, 79, 38, 23, 93, 9]
```

A straightforward approach to start with is to assign each agent their highest-valued item that hasn't been assigned yet, and then continue assigning the next highest-valued items until all items are allocated. This is a heuristic approach that may not always yield a perfectly envy-free allocation but can help in minimizing envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 0 (95), assign item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 3 (98), assign item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 1 (97), assign item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 4 (95), assign item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 3 (99), but it's already assigned, so the next highest is item 1 (75), but it's also assigned. Next, item 0 (68), but it's assigned. The next option is item 2 (18), assign item 2.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 5 (93), assign item 5.

Now, the remaining unassigned item is item 6. Let's assign it based on the highest remaining valuation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 at 75.
- Agent 1 values item 6 at 53.
- Agent 2 values item 6 at 12.
- Agent 3 values item 6 at 58.
- Agent 4 values item 6 at 57.
- Agent 5 values item 6 at 9.

Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

The allocations are now as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences to the extent possible.
