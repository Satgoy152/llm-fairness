Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  83  34  50  84  60  54
1  57  86  72  95  30  85  90
2  48  76  68  58  24  95  18
3  48  15  45  51  77  75   0
4  79  98  82  44  39  17  20
5  33  67  79  36  90  11  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 86 72 95 30 85 90]
 [48 76 68 58 24 95 18]
 [48 15 45 51 77 75  0]
 [79 98 82 44 39 17 20]
 [33 67 79 36 90 11 56]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Reviewing the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [56, 83, 34, 50, 84, 60, 54]
Agent 1: [57, 86, 72, 95, 30, 85, 90]
Agent 2: [48, 76, 68, 58, 24, 95, 18]
Agent 3: [48, 15, 45, 51, 77, 75, 0]
Agent 4: [79, 98, 82, 44, 39, 17, 20]
Agent 5: [33, 67, 79, 36, 90, 11, 56]
```

We aim to allocate items such that no agent envies another significantly. We'll attempt to balance the total value assigned to each agent, while considering their preferences. Below is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.
- Agent 5 gets no items.

This allocation ensures that each agent has items they value highly, while keeping the total number of items correctly allocated. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
