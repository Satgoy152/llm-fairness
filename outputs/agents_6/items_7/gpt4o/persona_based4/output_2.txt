Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  40  63  51  11   4  36
1   7  95  11   1  77  59  64
2  48  61   8  60  65  26  73
3  19  95  54   0  19  33  87
4  15  64  17  35   0  29  78
5  89   1  75  46  15  93   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their preferences. Given that we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will end up with 2 items. We'll use a strategy to balance the perceived value of allocations as evenly as possible. The key here is finding allocations that prevent any agent from feeling envious of another's allocation.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 2 (63), 3 (51)
   - Allocate item 2.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (95), 4 (77)
   - Allocate item 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (73), 4 (65)
   - Allocate item 6.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (87), 1 (95)
   - Allocate item 3 (zero value for them but to balance others).

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (78), 1 (64)
   - Allocate item 5.

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (93), 2 (75)
   - Allocate items 0 and 4 to balance total allocations and values.

Now, let's summarize these allocations into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items such that the value each agent receives is balanced relative to their own valuation of the items, thereby minimizing envy.
