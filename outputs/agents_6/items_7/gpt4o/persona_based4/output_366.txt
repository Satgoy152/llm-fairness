Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  88  61   3  39  31  94
1  95  11  17   8  22  92   8
2  13  51  86  98  90  19  99
3  21  32   0  96  92   1  19
4  64  31  83  52   6  93  27
5  62  57  92  24  11  56  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocations of others. Given the valuation matrix and the requirement that every agent gets an integer number of items, we will use a heuristic approach to achieve a fair allocation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued items for Agent 0 are items 6 (value 94) and 1 (value 88). We allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (value 95). We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 the highest, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 3 (value 98). We allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the highest, but it's allocated. The next highest is item 4 (value 92). We allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (value 93). We allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 2 the highest (value 92). We allocate item 2 to Agent 5.

7. **Remaining Item**: The only remaining item is item 1. Since Agent 0 values item 1 highly (value 88) and hasn't reached a comparable fairness threshold yet, we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: items 6, 1
- Agent 1: item 0
- Agent 2: item 3
- Agent 3: item 4
- Agent 4: item 5
- Agent 5: item 2

This distribution aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items based on their individual valuations, considering the constraints.

Here is the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
