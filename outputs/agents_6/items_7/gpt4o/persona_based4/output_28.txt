Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  52  80  48  68  40  78
1   8  94  64  47  70  21  12
2  86  27  83  34  32   1  18
3  43  36   0  21  63  52  59
4   6  35  87  30  46  83  81
5  63  74  36  99  80  49   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a manner that minimizes envy among the agents. We will try to distribute the items based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. Identify the highest value for each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets approximately the same number of items where possible.
2. Adjust based on achieving a fair distribution.

Here's an allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's total value while minimizing envy:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 5 (value 99)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 94)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 94)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value 87)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5 (value 80)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (value 83)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 78)

This allocation ensures that agents receive items they highly value, and the distribution is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated, and attempts to maximize the satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations.
