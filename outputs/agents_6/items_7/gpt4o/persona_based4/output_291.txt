Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  94  54   7  26  97  30
1  96  52  70  53  65  17   3
2   0  92  99   0  44  68  86
3  93  96  53  44  58  41  34
4  45  72   3  84  85  31   1
5  75  30  19   5  53  98  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner while aiming for envy-freeness, I will use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This method seeks to maximize the product of the agents' utilities, which often results in an allocation that is both efficient and fair.

Let's analyze the problem and perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 highly at 97.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 highly at 96.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highly at 99.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highly at 96.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 highly at 84.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 6 highly at 86.

By assigning each agent their most valued item, we ensure that the allocation is likely to be envy-free. Let's verify and distribute based on these preferences:

- Assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to agent 4.
- Assign item 6 to agent 5.

Now, we have one remaining item (item 4) to allocate. We should give it to the agent who values it most among those who have not already received a highly valued item:

- Agent 4 values item 4 at 85, which is the highest remaining value.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [3, 4]
- Agent 5: [6]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
