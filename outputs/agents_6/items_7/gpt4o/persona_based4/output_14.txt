Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  65  28  92  15  99  45
1  98  21  77  15   6  92  27
2  56  65  91  86  43  26  45
3  14  35  70  58  64  84   2
4   8  90  98  45  35  71  49
5  64  88  48  18  22  56  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by any other agent based on their valuations.

Let's proceed step by step to find a fair allocation:

1. **Examine Valuations:** Begin by examining the valuations to determine who values each item the most.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most if possible.
   - If allocating all items to the highest valuers results in one agent receiving too many items, then adjustments need to be made to ensure each agent gets at least one item (if possible given the constraints).

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Adjust allocations to attempt to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's consider the valuations and identify the highest bidder for each item:

- **Item 0:** Highest value by Agent 1 (98)
- **Item 1:** Highest value by Agent 4 (90)
- **Item 2:** Highest value by Agent 4 (98)
- **Item 3:** Highest value by Agent 0 (92)
- **Item 4:** Highest value by Agent 3 (64)
- **Item 5:** Highest value by Agent 0 (99)
- **Item 6:** Highest value by Agents 0 and 2 (45)

Considering the valuations and attempting to balance the allocations, a potential allocation is as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Items [3, 5]
- **Agent 1:** Item [0]
- **Agent 2:** Item [6]
- **Agent 3:** Item [4]
- **Agent 4:** Items [1, 2]
- **Agent 5:** No items

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and each agent gets at least one item or, in the case of Agent 5, no items due to the limitation of 7 items in total. This allocation is an attempt to balance the highest values while remaining within the constraints.

Here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints and the need to distribute exactly 7 items among 6 agents.
