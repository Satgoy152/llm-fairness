Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  55  39  95  23   4  16
1  48  53  14  30  48   6  96
2  77  74  80  37  65  47  86
3   1  20  16   6   1  50  41
4   3  36  19  12  33  54  81
5  37  39  16  50  59  65  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own, given their valuations. We'll attempt to achieve a balance where each agent receives items that collectively have high valuations according to their personal preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (95), so we can assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (96), so we can assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 (80), so we can assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 5 (50), so we can assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 (33), so we can assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 1 (39), so we can assign item 1 to Agent 5.
7. We have item 0 remaining. Considering the remaining value preferences:
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly (77), so we can also assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated all 7 items among the agents. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
