Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  51  17  76  86   0  44
1  57  80  76   2  20  19  61
2  81  97  44  46  59  14  26
3  50  42   0  21  65  34  22
4  49  61  62  75   5  46  51
5  95  81  35  62  60  69  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Here are the steps we can take to approach a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Values**: Determine the sum of values each agent assigns to all items to understand their relative valuation priorities.

2. **Prioritize High-Valuation Items**: Allocate items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Balance Allocations**: After high-value items are allocated, adjust the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives, aiming to reduce envy.

Given the matrix of valuations, let's proceed with an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the most (value = 86).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most (value = 80).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the most too (value = 97), but since it's taken, item 0 is next (value = 81).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the most, already taken, so item 5 (value = 34).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 the most (value = 75).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 0 the most, already taken, so item 5 is next but taken, thus item 6 (value = 71).

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Allocated to Agent 2
- **Item 1**: Allocated to Agent 1
- **Item 2**: Remaining, allocate to Agent 0 (as their next highest is item 0 which is taken)
- **Item 3**: Allocated to Agent 4
- **Item 4**: Allocated to Agent 0 (as it was their highest valuation)
- **Item 5**: Allocated to Agent 3
- **Item 6**: Allocated to Agent 5

With these considerations, here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```
