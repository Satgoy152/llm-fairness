Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17   4  90  35  52  23  47
1  10  87   7   3  81  94  91
2  92  73  31  79  96  43  67
3  89  19  24  59  16  17  89
4  88  31  59  46  77  73  36
5  23  45  30  43  78  21  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method inspired by the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) approach. This method aims to balance allocations based on agents' valuations and ensure a fair distribution of goods. Here's how we can proceed with the allocation:

1. **List the Agents and Items:**

   Agents: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
   Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

2. **Valuations Table:**

   ```
   Agent 0: [17, 4, 90, 35, 52, 23, 47]
   Agent 1: [10, 87, 7, 3, 81, 94, 91]
   Agent 2: [92, 73, 31, 79, 96, 43, 67]
   Agent 3: [89, 19, 24, 59, 16, 17, 89]
   Agent 4: [88, 31, 59, 46, 77, 73, 36]
   Agent 5: [23, 45, 30, 43, 78, 21, 81]
   ```

3. **Allocate Items Based on Valuations:**

   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item wherever possible.
   - Adjust allocations to ensure every agent's allocation respects the envy-freeness condition.

4. **Determine Allocations:**

   After careful balancing, here is a fair allocation of items:

   - Agent 0: Item 2 (highest value for agent 0)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (highest value for agent 1)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (highest value for agent 2)
   - Agent 3: Items 0 and 6 (high values for agent 3)
   - Agent 4: Item 3 (fair distribution)
   - Agent 5: Item 1 (fair distribution)

5. **Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one high-value item and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
