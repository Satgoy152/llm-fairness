Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  10  80  95  42  76  51
1  69  77  98  14  72  23  76
2  13  39  89  20   8  42  24
3  70  73  38  71   7   6  12
4  96  50  77  77  35  86  46
5  50   7  39  65  72  11  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation, or at least as close as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items that another agent received over their own bundle.

Let's consider the given valuations and attempt to assign items in a way that maximizes the agents' satisfaction based on their individual valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 77     | 10     | 80     | 95     | 42     | 76     | 51     |
| 1     | 69     | 77     | 98     | 14     | 72     | 23     | 76     |
| 2     | 13     | 39     | 89     | 20     | 8      | 42     | 24     |
| 3     | 70     | 73     | 38     | 71     | 7      | 6      | 12     |
| 4     | 96     | 50     | 77     | 77     | 35     | 86     | 46     |
| 5     | 50     | 7      | 39     | 65     | 72     | 11     | 81     |

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 3 and Item 2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 2. Since Item 2 is still available, assign it to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has no particularly high valuations compared to others, prioritize based on availability and relative preference. Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values Item 1 and Item 3. Item 3 is taken, so assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values Item 0 the most, and it is available. Assign Item 0 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values Item 6, which is still available. Assign Item 6 to Agent 5.
7. The remaining item, Item 4, can be allocated to either Agent 4 or Agent 5 based on their preferences. Assign Item 4 to Agent 5 for a more balanced approach.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy the highest value preferences of each agent while distributing items fairly across all agents.
