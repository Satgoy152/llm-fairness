Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  76  40  67  52   9  19
1  65  37  11  48  20  54  88
2  41  63  95  45  73  29   9
3  65  93   6  27  35  77  17
4  26  18  57  23  94  35  17
5  31  79  11  15  33  50  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In this problem, we aim to allocate the items to the agents such that the allocation is fair and envy-free to the extent possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation to their own. Although achieving perfect envy-freeness in all cases may not be feasible, we will attempt to distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy and seems equitable based on the given valuations.

To achieve this, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility based on their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valued item for agent 0 is item 1 (value 76). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** The highest valued item for agent 1 is item 6 (value 88). Assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** The highest valued item for agent 2 is item 2 (value 95). Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** The highest valued item for agent 3 is item 1, but it is already allocated. The next highest is item 5 (value 77). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** The highest valued item for agent 4 is item 4 (value 94). Assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5:** The highest valued item for agent 5 is item 1, but it is already allocated. The next highest is item 3 (value 15). Assign item 3 to agent 5.
7. **Remaining item:** Item 0 is left unallocated. The agent who values it the most and hasn't received a high-value item is agent 0. However, agent 3 has only one item of lower value. Assign item 0 to agent 3.

Now, we have allocated all items, and each agent has received at least one item. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy each agent based on their highest preferences, while ensuring that every item is allocated.
