Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  77  54  89   0  59  96
1  97  23  63  22  38  96  14
2   2  98  88  16  34   9  55
3  11   1  77  33   1   9  77
4  89  56  17  59  86  76  26
5  58  89  43  43  45  86   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, a common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should prefer their allocation over anyone else's allocation based on their valuations. Given the constraint that each agent should get an integer number of items, we aim to distribute exactly 7 items among the 6 agents.

Here is one allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 6 the most (96). Assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: After item 6, they value item 0 the most (97). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Their highest valuation is for item 1 (98). Assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Their highest valuation is for items 2 and 6 (77 each). Since item 6 is already taken, assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: They value item 0 highly, but it's taken. Their next highest valuation is for item 4 (86). Assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Their highest valuation is for item 1, but it's taken. Their next highest valuation is for item 5 (86). Assign item 5 to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items. We need to decide who should get the remaining item 3.

- **Item 3** is most valued by agent 0 (89), but agent 0 already has item 6, which they value equally. 
- Agent 4 also values item 3 highly (59), but they have item 4, which they value more highly (86).

Given these preferences, we can assign item 3 to agent 0, as this keeps their allocation highly valued and maintains balance across the agents.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation assigns exactly 7 items among the 6 agents, considering their valuations and maintaining a form of fairness.
