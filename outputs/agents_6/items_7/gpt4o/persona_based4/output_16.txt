Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  57  15  72  95  78   1
1  35  86  30  40  92  12  78
2  73  90  73  51  92  39  43
3  27   4  51  69  83  71  20
4   7  91  92  86  89  34   6
5  97  48  52  57  71  87  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach this problem, we need to allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is fair and ideally envy-free. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to any other agent more than their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness in practice can be quite challenging, especially with integer allocations and discrete items. 

Letâ€™s start by attempting a fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for this agent are items 4 (value = 95) and 0 (value = 82).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item is item 1 (value = 86).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item is item 1 (value = 90), but since it's allocated, the next is item 4 (value = 92).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item is item 4 (value = 83), but since it's allocated, the next is item 3 (value = 69).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item is item 2 (value = 92).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item is item 0 (value = 97), but since it's allocated, the next is item 5 (value = 87).

Now, let's assign the items:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 6 (highest available value after others)
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```
