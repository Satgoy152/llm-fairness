Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  51   3  62  45  49  51
1  57  21  65  97  75  68  47
2  29   5  91  13  31  31  48
3  30  51  85  17  20  36  72
4  60  38  28  39  58  87  99
5  30  47  71   1  90  20  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, a common approach is to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives, often referred to as the "maximin" strategy. This can also involve trying to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent more than their own. However, with an uneven number of items and agents, some compromises may have to be made.

Let's analyze the given valuations and aim for a fair division:

### Valuations Matrix:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 32 | 51 | 3  | 62 | 45 | 49 | 51 |
| 1          | 57 | 21 | 65 | 97 | 75 | 68 | 47 |
| 2          | 29 | 5  | 91 | 13 | 31 | 31 | 48 |
| 3          | 30 | 51 | 85 | 17 | 20 | 36 | 72 |
| 4          | 60 | 38 | 28 | 39 | 58 | 87 | 99 |
| 5          | 30 | 47 | 71 | 1  | 90 | 20 | 32 |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: High value for item 3 (62).
2. **Agent 1**: High value for item 3 (97), item 2 (65).
3. **Agent 2**: High value for item 2 (91).
4. **Agent 3**: High value for item 6 (72).
5. **Agent 4**: High value for item 6 (99), item 5 (87).
6. **Agent 5**: High value for item 4 (90).

We'll aim to distribute the items in a way that balances these preferences while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item if possible.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 1
- **Agent 3**: Item 0
- **Agent 4**: Item 6
- **Agent 5**: Item 4, Item 5

This allocation tries to respect the higher valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item where possible. Agent 5 ends up with two items due to the imbalance in the number of items versus agents.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item and respecting the higher valuations as much as possible.
