Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14   1  48  51  79  25  62
1  25  84   2  87  21  50  87
2  49  82  31  90  54  31  74
3  74   6  11  53  61  11  85
4  66  45  79  75  85  33  64
5  43  82  30  91  74   4   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and we minimize envy by considering the valuations of the items by each agent.

Given the valuations matrix, we can use the maximin strategy where each agent should receive items that maximize their minimum gain. We can also consider using the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division methods to help guide us in the allocation process. 

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (79), Item 3 (51), Item 6 (62).
   - Choose Item 4 (79).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (84), Item 3 (87), Item 6 (87).
   - Choose Item 3 (87).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (90), Item 1 (82), Item 6 (74).
   - Choose Item 3 was already chosen by Agent 1. Next choice is Item 1 (82).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (85), Item 0 (74), Item 4 (61).
   - Choose Item 6 (85).

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (85), Item 2 (79), Item 0 (66).
   - Choose Item 2 (79), since Item 4 was already chosen by Agent 0.

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 1 (82), Item 4 (74).
   - Choose Item 0 (43), since Item 3 was chosen by Agent 1 and Item 1 was chosen by Agent 2.

Now, let's re-evaluate to ensure every item is allocated and try to balance the distribution if necessary.

Here's a possible allocation to ensure each agent gets items, based on the highest available valuations for each:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, all 7 items are distributed among the agents, and the allocations seek to maximize each agent's valuation based on available items.
