Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53   5  69  70  71  89  22
1  18  65  22  44  94  34  11
2   7  99  13  41  83  96  72
3  31  16  37  87  56  66  70
4   9  93  82  76  64  49  42
5  36  49  89  24  37  18  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53  5 69 70 71 89 22]
 [18 65 22 44 94 34 11]
 [ 7 99 13 41 83 96 72]
 [31 16 37 87 56 66 70]
 [ 9 93 82 76 64 49 42]
 [36 49 89 24 37 18 52]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, or at least minimize envy. Envy-freeness means each agent should prefer their own allocation over anyone else's. While pure envy-freeness might not always be achievable, we can strive for a closely fair division.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53   5  69  70  71  89  22
1  18  65  22  44  94  34  11
2   7  99  13  41  83  96  72
3  31  16  37  87  56  66  70
4   9  93  82  76  64  49  42
5  36  49  89  24  37  18  52
```

We will allocate items considering the highest valuations each agent has for unallocated items until all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 (value 89).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (value 94).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (value 99).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (value 87).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 2 (value 82).
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 2, but since it is taken, item 0 (value 36) is the next highest.

After each agent has one item, we allocate the remaining item 6. Agent 2 values item 6 the most at 72, so we assign it to Agent 2.

Here is the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives an item they highly value, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
