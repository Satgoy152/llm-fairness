Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  71   1  17  73  71  56
1  65  85  12  23  61  25  33
2  89   7   9  55  63  20  26
3  31  58  51  68  99   4  96
4  42  78  30  52  88  91  57
5  37  48  50  56  12  62  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This ensures a form of fairness, though not necessarily complete envy-freeness, given that we are constrained by integer allocations and the number of items.

One reasonable approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items based on the highest relative value to an agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (when possible) and that the items are distributed fairly. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items, which can guide us in understanding the priorities.

2. Start assigning items to agents based on the highest value an agent has for an item, considering that each agent should receive at least one item, if possible.

3. Ensure that the total number of allocated items is 7.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Calculation
- Agent 0: [47, 71, 1, 17, 73, 71, 56] = Total Valuation: 336
- Agent 1: [65, 85, 12, 23, 61, 25, 33] = Total Valuation: 304
- Agent 2: [89, 7, 9, 55, 63, 20, 26] = Total Valuation: 269
- Agent 3: [31, 58, 51, 68, 99, 4, 96] = Total Valuation: 407
- Agent 4: [42, 78, 30, 52, 88, 91, 57] = Total Valuation: 438
- Agent 5: [37, 48, 50, 56, 12, 62, 14] = Total Valuation: 279

### Allocation
To ensure each agent gets at least one item and we allocate exactly 7 items, the following allocation can be made while prioritizing the items that yield the highest value to agents:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (Value: 73)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (Value: 85)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (Value: 89)
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (Value: 96)
- **Agent 4**: Item 5 (Value: 91)
- **Agent 5**: Item 3 (Value: 56)

This leaves one additional item to allocate:

- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (Value: 51), as they have a relatively high valuation for this remaining item.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, respecting the constraints and attempting to maximize fairness based on valuations.
