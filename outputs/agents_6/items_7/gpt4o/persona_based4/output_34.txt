Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  13  53  86  13  28  43
1   8  67  61  93  45  11  93
2  34  11  50  42  78  82  83
3  74  51  13  17  26  20  90
4  52  59  66  65  18  35  26
5  74  14  77  21  87  72  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple algorithm that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction for the items they receive. One common method is to use a "round-robin" or "serial dictatorship" approach, where each agent in a predetermined sequence selects their most valued item from the remaining unallocated items.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 3 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 3, but it's taken, so they pick item 6 (value 93).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 6, but it's taken, so they pick item 5 (value 82).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 6, but it's taken, so they pick item 0 (value 74).
5. **Agent 4** picks item 2 (value 66).
6. **Agent 5** picks item 6, but it's taken, so they pick item 4 (value 87).
7. **Agent 0** now picks item 0, but it's taken, so they pick item 2 (value 53).

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item if possible:

- Items remaining: 1

**Final Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0**: Items [3, 2]
2. **Agent 1**: Items [6]
3. **Agent 2**: Items [5]
4. **Agent 3**: Items [0]
5. **Agent 4**: Items []
6. **Agent 5**: Items [4]

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item (1):

- **Agent 4** gets item 1 (since they have no items).

The allocations are now complete with each agent having at least one item. Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```
