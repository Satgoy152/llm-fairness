Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  86  39   0  16  65  95
1  91  91  79   4  53  45  95
2  40  54  87  75  13   5  32
3  57   7  91  56  65  74  43
4  91  56  47  42  91  79  99
5  37  79  91  53  82  89  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[70 86 39  0 16 65 95]
 [91 91 79  4 53 45 95]
 [40 54 87 75 13  5 32]
 [57  7 91 56 65 74 43]
 [91 56 47 42 91 79 99]
 [37 79 91 53 82 89 67]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent gets at least one item (if possible). Given the valuations matrix, we should try to assign items to agents who value them the most while keeping the allocation balanced.

First, we'll summarize the highest valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 and Agent 4 (91)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (91)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (91)
- Item 3: Agent 2 (75)
- Item 4: Agent 0 and Agent 4 (91)
- Item 5: Agent 5 (89)
- Item 6: Agent 4 (99)

Now, let's try an allocation that respects these preferences:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value of 91).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value of 91).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value of 91).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value of 75).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value of 91).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 5 (value of 89).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value of 95).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and no agent is left out. 

Here are the allocations in the specified json format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
