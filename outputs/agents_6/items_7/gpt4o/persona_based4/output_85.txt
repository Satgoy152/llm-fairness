Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  43  47  52  13  17  48
1   5   8  96  95  58  20   3
2  86  69  46  25  12   0  51
3  75  13  26  64  85  28  67
4  31  92  61   5  81   9  52
5  85  72   9  12  14  33  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents according to their valuations such that each agent receives an integer number of items. One popular concept in fair division is envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations, we will attempt to allocate items such that the total value each agent perceives from their allocation is as balanced as possible, minimizing envy.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Assign items based on highest marginal gain for each agent while ensuring no envy:**
   - Start by checking which item gives the highest value to any unallocated item for each agent.
   - Allocate items one by one, prioritizing agents that receive the highest increase in satisfaction from unallocated items, and ensuring no other agent would envy that allocation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

- **Agent 0:** Highest value items are 3 (52) and 6 (48). Assign item 3.
- **Agent 1:** Highest value item is 2 (96). Assign item 2.
- **Agent 2:** Highest value item is 0 (86). Assign item 0.
- **Agent 3:** Highest value item is 4 (85). Assign item 4.
- **Agent 4:** Highest value item is 1 (92). Assign item 1.
- **Agent 5:** Highest value item is 6 (88), but it's already allocated. Next is 0 (85), but it's already allocated. Assign item 6.

Now, ensuring each agent has at least one item and that the total allocations sum up to 7:

- Agents 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have all received one item each.

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on each agent's highest valuation of unallocated items, attempting to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```
