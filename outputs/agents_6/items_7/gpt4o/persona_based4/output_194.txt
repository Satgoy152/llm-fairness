Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  38  33  23  79  71   9
1  92  32  32  21  96  94  54
2   4  23  61   7  88  63  93
3  66  49  39  72  28  63  89
4  73  73  89  55  96  62  65
5  84  63  81  71  96  22  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to optimize allocations so that each agent receives items according to their valuation, minimizing the envy among agents.

Let's analyze and allocate step-by-step:

1. **Agent 1:** Has the highest value for item 4 (96) and item 5 (94). Allocating items 4 and 5 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 2:** Values item 6 (93) the most. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 4:** Has high valuations for items 2 (89) and item 0 (73). We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

4. **Agent 0:** Has high valuation for item 0 (92). Given item 0 is not already taken, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 5:** Has a high valuation for item 3 (71) and item 1 (63). Allocate item 3 to Agent 5.

6. **Agent 3:** Leftover item is 1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation considers high-value items for each agent, trying to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives at least one item they value highly.
