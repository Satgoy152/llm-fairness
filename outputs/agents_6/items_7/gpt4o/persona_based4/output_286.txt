Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  35  95  91  62  42  96
1  56  20  95  23  75  27   7
2  71   4  29  83  23  44   4
3   3  54  55  18  25  12  89
4  85  12  79  32  96  86  22
5  88  26  14  66  38  62  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we want to ensure that each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they value the bundle of any other agent. This can be achieved by maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their valuation.

One possible method to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that remains unallocated. Given the table of valuations, let's simulate this process:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 96).
   - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 95).
   - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 83).
   - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 89).
   - Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 96).
   - Agent 5 picks item 5 (value 62).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 35), as it's the only item left.

After this allocation, each agent except agent 0 has one item, and agent 0 has two items. This allocation ensures that each agent gets their most valued item available during their turn, minimizing envy.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
