Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  91  11  59  51  67  98
1  56  46  66  88  56  48  64
2  62  40  28   6  17  20  54
3  44  17  52  73  68  91  19
4  28  20   7  90  47  49  79
5  89  91  27  38  57  67  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider the valuations provided and ensure that each agent ends up with an allocation that minimizes envy. The goal is to distribute the 7 items in a way that aligns closely with each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are assigned.

Here is one possible allocation considering the given valuations:

1. Agent 0: Values item 6 the highest (98), so we assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1: Values item 3 the highest (88), so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2: Values item 0 the highest (62), so we assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3: Values item 5 the highest (91), so we assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4: Values item 3 the highest (90), but item 3 is already taken. The next highest value is item 6 (79), but item 6 is also taken. The next highest available is item 4 (47), so we assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5: Values item 1 the highest (91), so we assign item 1 to agent 5.

Now, only item 2 remains unallocated. To complete the allocation:

- Agent 3: Can also value item 2 reasonably high (52), so we assign item 2 to agent 3.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest available preferences, and all 7 items are distributed.
