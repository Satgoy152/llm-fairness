Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  11  75   7  55  11  71
1  51  14  86  98  69  56  14
2  94  90  62  60  27  39  96
3  64   6  13  82  94   0  22
4   3  35  76  79  86  24  86
5  58  65  84  67  86  40  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can consider using an approach that focuses on maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:** Start by identifying the items that each agent values the most.
2. **Assign Items Iteratively:** Allocate items starting with those that have the highest individual valuations to the corresponding agents, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:** Continue the allocation until all items are distributed, verifying that no item is left unallocated.

Let's analyze and allocate based on the table:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 0 the most (83).
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 3 the most (98).
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 6 the most (96).
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 4 the most (94).
5. **Agent 4:** Also values item 4 the most (86), but item 4 is already allocated, so assign the next highest, item 6, which is also taken. Thus, assign item 2 (76).
6. **Agent 5:** Values item 2 (84), but it's already allocated, so assign item 4 (86).

Initial assignment based on highest values:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Item 5

Check for any unallocated items. Item 1 is still unallocated, and we will re-evaluate the distribution:
- Agent 0: Add item 1 (value 11).

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, aims to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences, and tries to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy.
