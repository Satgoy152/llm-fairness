Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  97  19  55  56  43  74
1  18  47  69  36  21   4  70
2  66  55  45  70  62  82  58
3  10   4  38  24  47  25  66
4  87  72  66  98  48   2   5
5  82  24   2  52  46  15  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy (where each agent values their assigned bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle), we will follow an approach to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 51 + 97 + 19 + 55 + 56 + 43 + 74 = 395
- Agent 1: 18 + 47 + 69 + 36 + 21 + 4 + 70 = 265
- Agent 2: 66 + 55 + 45 + 70 + 62 + 82 + 58 = 438
- Agent 3: 10 + 4 + 38 + 24 + 47 + 25 + 66 = 214
- Agent 4: 87 + 72 + 66 + 98 + 48 + 2 + 5 = 378
- Agent 5: 82 + 24 + 2 + 52 + 46 + 15 + 59 = 280

Now, we will try to assign items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

1. **Assign the highest valued items to agents who value them the most:**

   - Item 0: Agent 4 (value 87)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 97)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (value 69)
   - Item 3: Agent 4 (value 98)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (value 62)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (value 82)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (value 74)

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent gets the item they value the most among the available options, and the totals are fairly balanced given the constraints.

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 3],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and the distribution aims to minimize envy among agents based on their individual valuations.
