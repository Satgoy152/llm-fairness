Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  91  99  67   3  37  75
1  48   8  15  41  56  69  87
2  66  15  34  52  27  87  90
3  81  82  64  23  79  70  51
4  71  17  70  55  83  89  54
5  58  30  93  60  78   6  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness in allocating the 7 items to the 6 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. A possible approach to achieve envy-freeness is to maximize the minimum satisfaction among all agents and allocate items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation more than their own.

Let's implement a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Observation**: There are 7 items and 6 agents, so one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

2. **Highest Valuations**: Check the highest values each agent has for any item and allocate those first to ensure maximum satisfaction.

3. **Distribution Strategy**: Start by allocating the most valued items to each agent. If conflicts arise, prioritize the agent with the least total value so far.

4. **Balancing**: Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible.

Here is one potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 99)
- **Agent 1**: Item 6 (value 87)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (value 87)
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 (value 81)
- **Agent 4**: Item 4 (value 83)
- **Agent 5**: Item 3 (value 60), Item 1 (value 30)

This allocation considers both individual preferences and minimizes potential envy by ensuring high-value items are distributed across different agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 1]
}
```
