Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  31  71  81  60  83  67
1  94  99  12  97  88  52  19
2  69  82  96  69  60  19  58
3   8   2   7  92  67  69  79
4  87  59  23   1  40  79  76
5  12  51  48  72  17  96  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, I will attempt to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while trying to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive two items, and the others will receive one item each. 

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and finding a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 5 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 1 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 2 (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 3 (92).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 0 (87).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value for item 5 (96), but item 5 is better suited for Agent 0. Thus, chooses item 6 (53).

Now, we have one item (4) left to allocate. I'll allocate it to the agent with the next highest valuation for that item:

- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 88, which is the highest among remaining options.

Here's how the allocation looks:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [6]

This allocation attempts to maximize individual valuations while adhering to the constraints of the problem.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [6]
}
```
