Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  67  14  51  90  42  33
1  50  89  34  61  10  27  80
2  57  61   4  72  93   4  67
3  78  62  33  85  20  90  65
4  41  13  20  11  14  47  72
5  70  14  79  10   9  25  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy among agents by considering their valuations. A common approach is to assign items such that each agent receives items they value highly relative to others, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate how to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items: 4 (90), 1 (67).
2. **Agent 1** has high values for items: 1 (89), 6 (80).
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items: 4 (93), 3 (72).
4. **Agent 3** has high values for items: 5 (90), 3 (85).
5. **Agent 4** has high values for items: 6 (72).
6. **Agent 5** has high values for items: 2 (79), 0 (70).

Given these preferences, we can try to allocate items to maximize valuations while ensuring no two agents strongly prefer each other's allocation over their own.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items [5]
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Items [0, 2]

This allocation considers the high-value preferences and attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent a highly valued item they uniquely value or that they value more than others. Agent 4 ends up receiving no items because their highest value is for item 6, which is more highly valued by Agent 1, a more dominant preference.

Finally, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```
