Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  26  96  13   8   1  63
1  46  25  82  37  99  89  75
2  74  50  55  68  60   2  39
3  74  70  88  12  22  28  36
4  91  75   1  39  50  38  90
5  81  14  71  54  35  27  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with the goal of envy-freeness, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to use a method like "maximum marginal utility" or "round-robin" allocation, attempting to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations. However, since we have a relatively small problem, we can manually inspect and assign the items to the agents to try to balance the allocations as evenly as possible.

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 4 and 5.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
4. Agent 3 has high value for item 2 but since agent 0 takes it, we can consider item 1.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the most.
6. Agent 5 has the highest value for items 0 and 2, but since they're already taken, item 3 is next.

Let's assign the items based on these observations:

- Agent 0: Take items 0 and 2 (total value: 79 + 96 = 175).
- Agent 1: Take items 4 and 5 (total value: 99 + 89 = 188).
- Agent 2: Take item 3 (total value: 68).
- Agent 3: Take item 1 (total value: 70).
- Agent 4: Take item 6 (total value: 90).
- Agent 5: No items assigned based on remaining values.

This allocation considers each agent's highest valued items as much as possible, and ensures all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```
