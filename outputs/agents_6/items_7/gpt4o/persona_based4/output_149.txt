Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40   2  88  34  30  29  30
1  47  80  97  94  13  11  67
2  17  94   4  31  23  92  81
3  53  51   2  90  66  10  11
4  48  21  55   7  49  29  83
5  27  21  39  94  40  67  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the following approach. Each agent should receive a bundle of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their individual valuations. Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, some agents may end up with more items than others, but we should aim to minimize envy in terms of perceived value.

Let's allocate the items using a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible, without causing significant envy.
2. Adjust allocations if necessary to minimize envy.

Here is the step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 3 (53).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 2 (94).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (97).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 5 (94).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 3 (66), but since Agent 3 already has a high-value item, consider the next highest.
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 2 (92).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 2 (81).

Now, adjust to ensure all agents have items:

- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 4, the highest remaining preference without causing significant envy.
- Keep Item 6 with Agent 2 since they already have multiple high-value items, but ensure overall fairness.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1, 5, 6]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [3]

This allocation attempts to respect the highest preferences while ensuring all items are allocated. The final allocations in the required JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent some satisfaction based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
