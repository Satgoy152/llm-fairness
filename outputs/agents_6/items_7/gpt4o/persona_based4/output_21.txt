Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  93  47   0  55  28  85
1  73  96  11  99   8  79  97
2  92  79  65  74  15  53  89
3  40  48  68  76  72  63  45
4  57  18  76  41  20  43  45
5  38  94  91  23  45  42  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we'll aim for envy-free allocations, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in practice, we'll attempt to distribute the items in a balanced manner, considering the agents' valuations.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for item 0 and item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 0 and item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 2.
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation for item 1.

Let's consider a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6 (value 85)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 99)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (value 92)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (value 72)
- **Agent 4**: Item 2 (value 76)
- **Agent 5**: Items 1 and 5 (value 94 + 42 = 136)

This allocation attempts to give each agent an item they highly value, with Agent 5 receiving two items to balance the total number of items allocated.

JSON representation of allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

This solution is designed to minimize envy by assigning items to agents who place high value on them, while ensuring all items are allocated.
