Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  19  87  88  43  54  13
1  26  13  67  96   6   9  68
2  74  34  80  67  21  59  99
3  38  96  21  19  24  18   9
4  20  11  62  68  85  83  63
5  22   5  25  25  93  83  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 19 87 88 43 54 13]
 [26 13 67 96  6  9 68]
 [74 34 80 67 21 59 99]
 [38 96 21 19 24 18  9]
 [20 11 62 68 85 83 63]
 [22  5 25 25 93 83 40]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, considering the agents' valuations. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  19  87  88  43  54  13
1  26  13  67  96   6   9  68
2  74  34  80  67  21  59  99
3  38  96  21  19  24  18   9
4  20  11  62  68  85  83  63
5  22   5  25  25  93  83  40
```

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (value 88), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most, but since it's already allocated, we look for the next highest value, which is item 2 (value 67), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (value 99), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most (value 96), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the most (value 85), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 4 the most, but it's already allocated. The next highest value is item 5 (value 83), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Finally, one item is left unallocated, which is item 0. We can assign it to the agent with the least total value from their current allocation or randomly assign it to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's see the remaining value for each agent:

- Agent 0: [88]
- Agent 1: [67]
- Agent 2: [99]
- Agent 3: [96]
- Agent 4: [85]
- Agent 5: [83]

Assigning item 0 to the agent with the least total value (Agent 5, who has 83) can balance the allocation a bit more.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 0]
}
```
