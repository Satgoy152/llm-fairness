Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  74  34  28  19  20  29
1  49  97  62  79  28  55  62
2  44  21  74  22  75  87   1
3  23  89  46  70  34  63  38
4  11  86  77  88  11   4  89
5  83  19  74  43  82  28  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which means each agent should believe they have received the best bundle of items according to their own preferences. Given the table of valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items so that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

One approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin or serial dictatorship mechanism, where agents pick items one by one based on their preferences. However, to ensure a balanced and fair allocation, we might need to make adjustments or use optimization techniques.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Determine the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest preferences, starting with the agent who values all items the highest.
3. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and the total allocation equals 7 items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (97).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (88).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (87).
- Agent 5 values item 0 the highest (83).
- Agent 0 values item 1 the second highest (74), but it's already taken. Next, they value item 2 the highest (34).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (89), but it's already taken. Next, they value item 3 the highest (70), which is also taken. Next, they value item 5 the highest (63), but it's already taken. Next, they value item 2 the highest (46), which is also taken. Next, they value item 4 the highest (34).
- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest among what's left.

After considering the valuations and ensuring no agent is left without a fair share, here is a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, with items distributed fairly among the agents.
