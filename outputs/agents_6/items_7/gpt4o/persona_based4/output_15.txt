Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  88  19  53  14  58  52
1  12  31  65  65  99  38  96
2  50  84  43  46  24  37  43
3  31  74   7  85  12  50  52
4  20  74  98  65  33  81  81
5  45  53  18  36  42  71  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the table of valuations, we will attempt to assign items to agents by maximizing their satisfaction while ensuring no agent is envious.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 6 (99 and 96, respectively). Assign these two items to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 4** highly values item 2 with a valuation of 98. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

3. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (88). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most (85). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 5** values item 5 the most (71). Assign item 5 to Agent 5.

6. **Agent 2** is left with item 0, which they value at 50, and no other agent has a higher valuation for it. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is based on maximizing each agent's utility for the items they receive. The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```
