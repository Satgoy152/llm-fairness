Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  20  19  84  17  17  77
1  87  98  72  85  45  97  70
2  29  84  57  14  25   2  83
3  68  28  47  33  24  81   0
4  72  94  30  33  22  11  46
5  32  32  65  31  14  28  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

One approach to achieve this is using a method like "sequential allocation" or the "round-robin" approach. This involves iterating over the agents and allowing them to choose their most valued available item until all items are allocated.

Given the valuations provided, we can proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 1, so we'll allocate item 1 to agent 1.
2. Agent 0's next highest value is item 0, so we'll allocate item 0 to agent 0.
3. Agent 3 values item 5 the most, so we'll allocate item 5 to agent 3.
4. Agent 2 values item 6 the most, so we'll allocate item 6 to agent 2.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most, but it is already taken, so we look for the next highest, which is item 0. However, it is also taken, so item 2 is the next highest available option for agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 the most, but it is already taken, so we look for the next highest, which is item 6. However, it is also taken, so item 3 is the next highest available option for agent 5.
7. Finally, item 4 is left unallocated, and agent 0's next highest available preference is item 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item that they value highly, and each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
