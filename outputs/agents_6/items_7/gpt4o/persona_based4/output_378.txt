Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61   4  94  91  23  21  58
1  12  90  62  43  94  67  62
2  73  15  55  16  82  57  34
3   8  65  99  14  76  19  13
4  22  74  10  47  11  99   9
5  75  41  39  54  96   4  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider an allocation that maximizes fairness, potentially focusing on envy-freeness or some balanced approach where each agent receives an equitable share based on their preferences.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that attempts to minimize envy by considering agents' highest valuations for items and distributing them as evenly as possible. Since each agent's valuation of items is different, we'll allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring no agent is left without considering their preferences.

Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 3, who values it at 99, the highest valuation for any item by any agent.
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 5, who values it at 96, the highest remaining valuation.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, who values it at 90, the highest valuation for that item.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 5, since they value it at 75, higher than any other remaining agents for other items.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 4, as they value it at 99, the highest remaining valuation for any item by any agent.
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, who values it at 91, the highest remaining valuation.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0, who values it at 58, balancing the allocation further.

Now, let's ensure all items have been allocated and each agent's preferences are somewhat respected:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers high-value preferences for each agent while ensuring every item gets allocated, respecting the need for each agent to have a chance at their most valued items.
