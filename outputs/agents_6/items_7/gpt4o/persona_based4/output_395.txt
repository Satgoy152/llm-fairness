Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  41   7  68  57  66  69
1  99  61  96  63  28  89  80
2   6  70  50  80   7  43  96
3  36  33  60  25   9  25  48
4  68  62  74  16  53  36  81
5  21  38   6   0  75  52  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we can utilize a method that attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives. The approach I'll use is an iterative process, considering each agent's highest-valued available item and assigning items to minimize envy.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Initial Considerations**:
   - We have 7 items and 6 agents, so some agents will end up with more items than others.
   - The goal is to minimize envy, meaning each agent should feel they have received a fair share given their preferences.

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - Consider the highest valued item for each agent that is not yet allocated.
   - Assign items to agents based on the highest remaining individual valuation for unallocated items until all items are allocated.

3. **Assign Items**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 most (99), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 6 most (96), so assign item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 second-most (85) and item 6 third-most (69), but these are taken. Next, item 5 (66) is highest available, so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 4 values item 2 next most (74), so assign item 2 to Agent 4.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 most (60), but it's taken; next is item 3 (25), so assign item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 5 values item 4 most (75), so assign item 4 to Agent 5.
   - Only item 1 is remaining. Check remaining agent preferences:
     - Agent 0: Item 1 value (41), not taken.
     - Agent 1: Item 1 value (61), assign to Agent 1 (highest remaining value).

4. **Final Allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Item 5
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 1
   - Agent 2: Item 6
   - Agent 3: Item 3
   - Agent 4: Item 2
   - Agent 5: Item 4

5. **JSON Format**:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives, given certain constraints and the goal of reducing envy among agents.
