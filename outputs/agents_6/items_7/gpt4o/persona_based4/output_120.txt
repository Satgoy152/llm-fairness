Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  11  71  27  30  25  81
1  73  70  78  33   7  49   3
2  73  15  97  44  71  37  60
3  28  69  72  36  90  11  48
4  17  28  18  92  93   5  46
5   8  39  51  80  35   3  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by any other agent over their own bundle. Given the constraint that each agent can receive an integer number of items, one potential approach is to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's start by examining the highest valued items for each agent and try to distribute them in a way that balances overall satisfaction. Since there are more agents than items, some agents will inevitably receive no items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible.

Here is one such allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 0, as it holds the highest value (81) for them.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as it holds the highest value (73) for them.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as it holds the highest value (97) for them.
4. Assign item 4 to agent 3, as it holds the highest value (90) for them.
5. Assign item 3 to agent 4, as it holds the highest value (92) for them.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1, as it holds the second highest value (49) for them after item 0.
7. Agent 5 will not receive an item due to the limited number of items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible within the constraints of the problem. Note that agent 5 ends up with no items due to the limited supply relative to the number of agents.
