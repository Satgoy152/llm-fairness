Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  88  19  66  47  61  39
1  36  12   7  61  76  12  75
2  70  49  36  34  33  48  97
3  75  76  32  31  67   0  36
4  72  13  51  14  12  10  34
5  13  20  99  89  70  22  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but the allocation should aim to minimize envy.

Let's approach this by attempting to balance the total value each agent receives. We will focus on maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items:** Start by allocating items with the highest valuations to the agents who value them the most to ensure satisfaction.
   
2. **Balance Remaining Items:** Distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation across agents.

3. **Check and Adjust:** Verify that no agent envies another's allocation by comparing the values.

Following this approach, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives Item 1 (88) as it is their highest valued item.
2. Agent 1 receives Item 4 (76) as it is their highest valued item.
3. Agent 2 receives Item 6 (97) as it is their highest valued item.
4. Agent 3 receives Item 3 (31) and Item 3 (67) because they highly value these items.
5. Agent 4 receives Item 0 (72) as it is their highest valued item.
6. Agent 5 receives Item 2 (99) as it is their highest valued item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one highly valued item, thereby minimizing potential envy among agents.
