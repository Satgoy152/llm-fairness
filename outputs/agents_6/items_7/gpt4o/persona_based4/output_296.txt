Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  57  98  76  11  92  67
1  75  56  65  80  96  96  67
2  82  65  41  61  19  36  96
3  61  50  93   2  31  49  68
4  38  12  81  86  26  14  95
5  95   3  34   4   5  79  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. Given the agents' valuations, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated bundle.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High values for items 0, 2, and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: High values for items 3, 4, and 5.
3. **Agent 2**: High value for item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: High value for item 2.
5. **Agent 4**: High value for item 3.
6. **Agent 5**: High value for item 0.

With these high-value items in mind, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 2 (highest value for these items for agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 4 (highest value for these items for agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 (highest value for this item for agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 (high value for this item, not the highest but fits well without causing envy)
- **Agent 4**: Item 1 (lower competition on this item)
- **Agent 5**: No items (agent 5 has generally lower valuations compared to others)

This allocation aims to minimize envy among agents given their preferences. Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, minimizing the potential for envy and maintaining fairness across the board.
