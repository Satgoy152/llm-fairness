Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  20  51   2   5  89  86
1   8  20  89  61  39  56  86
2  31  55  83  41  18  78  22
3  23  26  98  49  50  89  85
4  52  26  33  35  15  88  76
5   0  26  13  14   3  43  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem with the goal of achieving envy-freeness (or as close to it as possible given the constraints), let's follow a step-by-step approach. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

We have 6 agents and 7 items. The typical approach involves assigning items while considering each agent's preferences to minimize potential envy.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation
First, we determine the value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: 95, 20, 51, 2, 5, 89, 86
- Agent 1: 8, 20, 89, 61, 39, 56, 86
- Agent 2: 31, 55, 83, 41, 18, 78, 22
- Agent 3: 23, 26, 98, 49, 50, 89, 85
- Agent 4: 52, 26, 33, 35, 15, 88, 76
- Agent 5: 0, 26, 13, 14, 3, 43, 12

### Step 2: Allocate Items
We will assign items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while attempting to distribute items fairly.

1. **Agent 0:** Assign the highest-valued items to Agent 0 first since they have a high valuation for certain items:
   - Item 0 (95)
   - Item 5 (89)

2. **Agent 1:** Next, assign items to Agent 1 based on their valuations:
   - Item 2 (89)
   - Item 6 (86)

3. **Agent 3:** Continue with Agent 3:
   - Item 3 (49)
   - Item 4 (50)

4. **Agent 2:** Assign remaining items to Agent 2:
   - Item 1 (55)

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items

This allocation aims to minimize envy while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, except for Agents 4 and 5 who receive none. This allocation uses a priority based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction according to their highest valuations.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
