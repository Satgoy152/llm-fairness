Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  84  28  15   4  43  78
1  71  72  34  40  92  45  60
2  58  14  69   9   7  17  57
3  85  86  49  98  70  84  15
4  93  12  57  40  38  70  55
5  94  21  38   4  52  34  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent values their bundle as much as possible while maintaining envy-freeness. Given the valuations, we will attempt to distribute the items so that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. One approach is to start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent, iteratively adjusting until all items are allocated.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 at 84. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 at 92. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 at 69. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 at 98. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 at 93. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 5 at 34. Assign item 5 to Agent 5.

At this point, each agent has one item, and all items except item 6 have been allocated.

**Allocation of Remaining Item:**

7. **Item 6** is valued highest by Agent 0 (78), but to maintain fairness, we check if assigning it elsewhere can prevent envy:
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1, who values it at 60, maximizing envy-freeness across allocations.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has been considered for their highest value item in a manner that maintains fairness.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the agents' preferences while ensuring that the distribution is fair based on the given valuations.
