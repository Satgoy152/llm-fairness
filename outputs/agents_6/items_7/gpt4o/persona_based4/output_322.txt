Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  11  42  60  71  12  89
1  34  54  99  19  53  65  91
2  57   2  18  89  62   5  18
3  24  60  86  55   5  85  79
4  59  14  85  53  33  20  18
5  86  14  46  53  77  26   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. Given the differences in valuations, an exact envy-free allocation may not always be possible, but we can try to minimize envy.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the highest at 89.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest at 99.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the highest at 89.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 at 86 and item 1 at 60.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 at 85.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 0 the highest at 86.

Given these observation points, we will attempt to allocate the items in a way that tries to satisfy the highest valuations and minimize envy:

- **Agent 1** should get item 2, as they value it the highest.
- **Agent 5** should get item 0, as they value it the highest.
- **Agent 0** should get item 6, as they value it the highest.
- **Agent 2** should get item 3, as they value it the highest.
- **Agent 3** should get item 1, as it is their next highest valued item.
- **Agent 4** should get item 4, as they have no very highly valued items left, but this is a reasonable allocation.
- **Agent 3** should also get item 5, as they still have a high valuation for this item and this balances allocations.

Here is the JSON format of allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

Each agent gets items according to their highest preferences, while ensuring that all items are allocated and minimizing potential envy.
