Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  13  19  16  97  40  24
1  89  61  28  12  76  74  70
2  79   6   9  30  89  77  45
3  77  67  75  84  39  22  34
4  51  80  76  59   9  21  49
5  95  51  87  87   7  26  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [89 61 28 12 76 74 70]
 [79  6  9 30 89 77 45]
 [77 67 75 84 39 22 34]
 [51 80 76 59  9 21 49]
 [95 51 87 87  7 26 98]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy among agents by attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Given the valuations, a reasonable strategy is to allocate items to agents in such a way that each gets the items they value most, considering the constraints. Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (97).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (89).
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly (77).
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly (84).
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (80).
- Agent 5 values item 6 highly (98).

This leaves item 2, which is valued at 87 by agent 5. Allocating it to agent 5 makes sense to maximize their satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and it aligns with agents' preferences to the extent possible, given the constraint of distributing exactly 7 items among 6 agents.
