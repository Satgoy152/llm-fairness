Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  88  15  45  71  18  67
1  19  13  40  73   0  53   9
2  59  31  18  72  38  56  37
3  64  64  71  26  86  72  59
4  23  13  89  57  18  95  27
5  28  95  72  88   6  13  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
The goal is to allocate the items to the agents in such a way that it reflects fair division and minimizes envy among agents. One possible approach is to use the Envy-Free (EF) allocation method or any approximation of it, ensuring that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as they would envy from another allocation.

Let's consider the preferences and allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1 (88) and 4 (71). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 (73) the highest. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 (72) highly. However, item 3 is already allocated. The next best is item 5 (56). Assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 (86) the highest. Assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 (95) the highest, but it's already allocated. The next best is item 2 (89). Assign item 2 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 1 (95) the highest, but it's already allocated. The next best is item 3 (88), but it's also allocated. Assign item 0 (28) to agent 5.

Now, we have assigned 6 items and need to allocate one more:

* Item 6 is not assigned. Review the preferences:
  * Agent 0: 67
  * Agent 1: 9
  * Agent 2: 37
  * Agent 3: 59
  * Agent 4: 27
  * Agent 5: 12

Agent 0 values item 6 the most among the unassigned items, so assign item 6 to agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```
