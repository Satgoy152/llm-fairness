Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  39   6  94  42   5  38
1  57  56  58  78  45  26  88
2  22  76  16  37  32  28  96
3   1  79  95   1  41  19   3
4  77  72  53  37  62  83   9
5   5  72  70  81  68  94  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider achieving envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation, given their valuations of the items.

Let's approach this by trying to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive, while also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 3 (94) the most.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 6 (88) the most.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 6 (96), but since item 6 is already taken, they can get item 1 (76).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 2 (95) the most.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 5 (83) the most.
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 5 (94), but since item 5 is already taken, they can get item 3 (81).

Now, let's adjust and ensure that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [3] (94)
- Agent 1: [6] (88)
- Agent 2: [1] (76)
- Agent 3: [2] (95)
- Agent 4: [5] (83)
- Agent 5: Needs an item, they can get item 0 (5)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 4 (62) can be given to agent 4 as it increases their total value significantly.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [5, 4]
- Agent 5: [0]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and all items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
