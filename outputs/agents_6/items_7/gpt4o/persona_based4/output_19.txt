Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  28  97  44  54  84  21
1  16  89  42  41  75  58  31
2   2   9  39  89  69  26  56
3  17   2  20  78  79  98  39
4  71  82  95  30  22  72  82
5  36  91  35  98  78  66  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and aim for an envy-free distribution, we will consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them in a way that minimizes envy. We will try to prioritize each agent's highest valuations while ensuring every item is allocated.

Here are the allocations:

- Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 2 (97) and 5 (84).
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (89) and item 4 (75).
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly (89) and item 4 (69).
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly (98) and item 4 (79).
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly (95) and item 1 (82).
- Agent 5 values item 3 highly (98) and item 1 (91).

Now, let's allocate these items based on the valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one of their highest valued items:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 (98).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 0 (71).
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 4 (78).

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Only item 6 remains.

To allocate item 6, we observe which agent values it most:

- Agent 0: 21
- Agent 1: 31
- Agent 2: 56
- Agent 3: 39
- Agent 4: 82
- Agent 5: 23

Agent 4 values item 6 the highest and doesn't have a second item yet, so we'll allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent gets at least one of their top valued items, aiming for minimal envy.
