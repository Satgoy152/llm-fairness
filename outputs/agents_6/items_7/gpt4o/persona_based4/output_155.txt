Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  68   1  96  30   4  69
1  26  11   4  53  39  46  27
2  65  10  12  98  28   8  14
3  98  64  31  20  45  31  88
4  19  34   9  31  94  12  70
5  96  53  42  41  94  65  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we want to distribute the items among the agents such that envy is minimized, and each agent gets at least one item if possible. This can be challenging, but we can strive to make sure that the allocation is as equitable as possible given the constraints.

Let's proceed with the allocation by considering the valuations and attempting to distribute the items to maximize the perceived fairness.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations on items 1 and 3. Allocate item 3 (value 96) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: After other allocations, Agent 1 can be allocated item 4 (value 39) which is one of the higher valuations for them.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (value 65) to Agent 2, as it is the highest value for them.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 (value 88) to Agent 3, as it is one of the highest values for them.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 5 (value 12) to Agent 4, as it balances their overall valuation.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 2 (value 42) to Agent 5, as it maintains a relatively high valuation.
7. **Remaining Item for Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (value 68) to Agent 0 since they still have capacity for a new item and it is highly valued by them.

### Final Allocation:
```
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on high individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
