Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  16  69  54  65  81  10
1  98  19   6  81  18  65  47
2  97  22  41  50  15  31  43
3  60  93  52  64  39  96  73
4  18  53  18  23  59  70  94
5   4  34  71  60   2  99  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that they have received a fair share according to their valuations. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, we will allocate the items in such a way that no agent envies another. 

One approach to achieve this is by using the maximum marginal value method, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, as long as it does not cause envy. This can be adjusted through iterations to ensure all items are allocated fairly.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by agent 1 (98). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by agent 3 (93). Allocate item 1 to agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by agent 5 (71). Allocate item 2 to agent 5.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by agent 0 (54). Allocate item 3 to agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by agent 0 (65). Allocate item 4 to agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by agent 5 (99). Allocate item 5 to agent 5.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is by agent 4 (94). Allocate item 6 to agent 4.

This allocation gives each item to the agent who values it the most, considering the need to distribute all 7 items. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent either receives items they value highly or none at all if they do not have the highest valuation for any item.
