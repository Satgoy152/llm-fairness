Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11   2   2  19  31  83  87
1  17  79  60  36  75  67   8
2  76  51  79  60  73   5  45
3  41   1  49  52  56  10  94
4   8  89  95   5  34   8  21
5  78  26  29  67  44   9  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly relative to their preferences. We will attempt to allocate items such that each agent feels satisfied with their share, minimizing envy among agents.

Let's examine the valuations and attempt an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 5 and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the most.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 the most, but since it's already taken by Agent 2, consider their next high valuation.
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 the most.

Considering the above preferences, we can start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each gets at least one of their preferred items where possible.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 6] (valued at 83 and 87)
- **Agent 1**: Item [1] (valued at 79)
- **Agent 2**: Item [2] (valued at 79)
- **Agent 3**: Item [4] (valued at 56)
- **Agent 4**: Item [3] (valued at 5, although it's not their highest, it ensures an allocation)
- **Agent 5**: Item [0] (valued at 78)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to give each agent an item they value highly. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
