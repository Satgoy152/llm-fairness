Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  39  80  89  94  97  95
1  19  53  20  71  11  80  19
2   8  80  41  84  17  37  85
3   9  96  53  55  90  49  54
4  63  50  80  40  12  84  30
5  52  56  57  37  59  59  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for a solution that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent more than their own. Given the constraints, we'll use a heuristic approach to achieve a fair distribution.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Initial Considerations:**
   - Each agent should receive at least one item, if possible.
   - The total number of items is 7, and we need to distribute them among 6 agents.
   - We will try to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, but ensure that each agent gets a fair share.
   - Adjust allocations to balance the number of items each agent receives.

3. **Iterative Allocation:**
   - We will start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.
   - Then, we will redistribute if necessary to ensure a fair allocation.

Let's see the allocation following the strategy:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (86).
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 3 (96).
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 0 (80).
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 (89).
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (94).
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (97).
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (95).

Now, let's redistribute to ensure fairness, as Agent 0 has all the items:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 3.
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 3.
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 5.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the number of items each agent receives while trying to respect the highest individual valuations as much as possible.
