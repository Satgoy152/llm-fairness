Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  35  71  74  65  80  44
1  43  94   2  72  24  71   3
2  48  44   3  64  39  61  21
3   3  90   4  86  17  76  72
4  90  57  42  11  17  40  97
5  31  95  24  80  25  83  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate these items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy and maximize the satisfaction of each agent. One common method for achieving a fair allocation is the "Envy-Free" approach, which aims to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations provided, we can use a greedy allocation strategy to attempt to distribute the items fairly. Here, we consider assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are distributed.

First, let's identify the agent who values each item the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 90 (highest among all agents).
- Item 1: Agent 5 values it at 95.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 71.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it at 86.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 65.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 80.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it at 97.

Now, let's allocate these items to the respective agents:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 5.
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 4.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a large number of items due to their high valuations. To ensure each agent gets at least one item, we can adjust this allocation slightly while maintaining fairness. Let's reallocate some items:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [4]

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
