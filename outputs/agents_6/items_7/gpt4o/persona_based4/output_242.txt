Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  98  73  43  22  53  57
1   5  64  48  99  65  90  56
2  34  24  57  91  86  69  38
3  74  30  11  42  48  94  11
4  10  40  32  27  79   6  85
5  94  74  54  29   6  85  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible. We'll use the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to distribute items in a way that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they would value anyone else's allocation, as much as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: First, we calculate each agent's total valuation of all items to understand their preferences and relative satisfaction.

2. **Assign High-Value Items**: We assign items based on the highest individual valuations, trying to ensure that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

3. **Balance Remaining Items**: We distribute remaining items to balance the total valuation received by each agent as closely as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 1 (98), so give them item 1.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (99), so give them item 3.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (86), so give them item 4.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (94), so give them item 5.
- **Agent 4** highly values item 6 (85), so give them item 6.
- **Agent 5** highly values item 0 (94), so give them item 0.
- This leaves item 2, which should be allocated to balance valuations. Agent 0 values item 2 (73), which is a comparatively higher valuation than what other agents have left, so assign item 2 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation considers their highest preferences, aiming to minimize envy among agents.
