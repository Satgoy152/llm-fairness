Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  37  80  21  11  80  65
1  93  31  17   8  78  52  17
2  50  49  34  50  99  92  47
3  67  32  31  77  91  98   7
4  37  42  87  26  40  77  57
5  20  49  64  63  91   9  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy, we aim to allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given that we have more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others might receive none. However, the goal is to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations and create an allocation that attempts to distribute value fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for items 2 and 5. 
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for items 0 and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for items 4 and 5.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for items 4 and 5.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for items 2 and 5.
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation for items 4 and 2.

Given these preferences, we will distribute the items:

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 1 (valued at 93, highest among all agents).
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 0 (valued at 37, relatively high for this agent).
- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 4 (valued at 87, highest among all agents).
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 3 (valued at 77, highest among all agents).
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 2 (valued at 99, highest among all agents).
- **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 3 (valued at 98, highest among all agents).
- **Item 6**: Assign to Agent 0 (valued at 65, relatively high for this agent).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's perceived value from their most preferred items while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```
