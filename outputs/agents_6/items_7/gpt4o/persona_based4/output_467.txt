Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  78  31  11  33  56  84
1  24  87  13  79  57  20   7
2  10   3  17  38  55  25  72
3  31  15  10  19  86  37  74
4  94  16  20  10  47  53   6
5  73  78   5  42  73  21  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the minimum satisfaction or minimize envy. Given the valuations, one approach is to try to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, if possible.

First, let's examine the highest-valued item for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 97.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 87.
- Agent 2 values item 6 at 72.
- Agent 3 values item 4 at 86.
- Agent 4 values item 0 at 94.
- Agent 5 values item 6 at 99.

To minimize envy, we can try to allocate these high-value items to their respective agents:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 5.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 5) to the agents with consideration to their preferences:

5. Agent 2 values item 3 at 38, which is relatively high for them, so assign item 3 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 4 values item 5 at 53, so assign item 5 to Agent 4.
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as they have a higher valuation for it compared to other agents.

This allocation aims to balance the distribution by providing high-valued items to each agent as much as possible.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one item they have a high valuation for.
