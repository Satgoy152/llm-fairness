Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  62   6  92  17  54   5
1  41  25  48   4  37  40  26
2  70  71  22  33  13  20  35
3  95  76  31  93  90  54  60
4  44  47  97  48  23  97  55
5  62  75  32  21  54  56  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations table, we need to distribute the 7 items such that each agent feels their allocation is fair based on their own valuations.

First, let's summarize the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [15, 62, 6, 92, 17, 54, 5]
- Agent 1: [41, 25, 48, 4, 37, 40, 26]
- Agent 2: [70, 71, 22, 33, 13, 20, 35]
- Agent 3: [95, 76, 31, 93, 90, 54, 60]
- Agent 4: [44, 47, 97, 48, 23, 97, 55]
- Agent 5: [62, 75, 32, 21, 54, 56, 74]

We aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [3] (Value: 92)
- Agent 1: [0, 4] (Value: 41 + 37 = 78)
- Agent 2: [1] (Value: 71)
- Agent 3: [6] (Value: 60)
- Agent 4: [2, 5] (Value: 97 + 97 = 194)
- Agent 5: [] (No items allocated)

This allocation provides each agent with at least one item they value highly, and Agent 5 receives no items to ensure the total of 7 items are allocated. It's a challenge to perfectly balance valuations due to the constraint of integer items per agent, but this allocation aims to reduce envy:

- Agent 0 receives their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 receives two items totaling a relatively high value.
- Agent 2 receives their second-highest valued item.
- Agent 3 receives an item with a relatively high value.
- Agent 4 receives their highest valued item and another high-value item.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 5],
    "5": []
}
```
