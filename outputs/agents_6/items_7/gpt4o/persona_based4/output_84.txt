Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  72  50  20   8  52  59
1  56  70  60  17  47   1  49
2  99  23  33  86  49  74   1
3  25   6  77  73  40  34  16
4  76  51  63  21  70  36  25
5  93   4  48  90  48  77  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [99 23 33 86 49 74  1]

 [76 51 63 21 70 36 25]
 [93  4 48 90 48 77 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations. Envy-freeness can be complex to achieve perfectly, especially with integer constraints and a small number of items, but we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Given the valuations:

```
0: [26, 72, 50, 20, 8, 52, 59]
1: [56, 70, 60, 17, 47, 1, 49]
2: [99, 23, 33, 86, 49, 74, 1]
3: [25, 6, 77, 73, 40, 34, 16]
4: [76, 51, 63, 21, 70, 36, 25]
5: [93, 4, 48, 90, 48, 77, 44]
```

We will use a method that tries to give each agent their most valued items first while ensuring no more than one item per agent initially, and then adjust as needed:

1. **Initial Allocation:** Allocate the highest valued item for each agent.
2. **Adjust for Fairness:** If some agents have empty allocations, we will adjust by reallocating less valued items from those with more items.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- Agent 0: Highest value is item 1 (72).
- Agent 1: Highest value is item 0 (56).
- Agent 2: Highest value is item 0 (99) but already taken, so item 3 (86).
- Agent 3: Highest value is item 2 (77).
- Agent 4: Highest value is item 0 (76) but already taken, so item 4 (70).
- Agent 5: Highest value is item 0 (93) but already taken, so item 3 (90).

Now we have:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [5]

So far, all agents have one item, but we need to allocate item 6. We can give it to the agent with the next highest valuation for an unallocated item:
- Agent 0: Next highest is item 6 (59).

Final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's valuation based on their preferences and distributes the items fairly, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.
