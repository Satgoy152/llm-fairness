Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  77  67  61  84  51  10
1   5  50  36  45  54  81  88
2  56  84  28  59  87   9  55
3  98  77  97  67  20  64  16
4  46  13  64  39  71  91  61
5  53  64   3  34  98  76  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can start by considering the method of "round-robin" allocation or "max-min" allocation. However, given the complexity of reaching a perfectly envy-free allocation with integer items, we will aim to minimize envy as much as possible, ensuring each agent gets a fair value relative to their preferences.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent to identify which items are most valuable to them.
2. Allocate items based on descending valuation preference for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and trying to balance the total value received by each agent.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest.
- Agent 5 values item 4 the highest.

We will allocate the items to balance the total value:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0 because it's their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 6 to agent 1 because it's their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 3 because it's their highest valued item and also maximizes their total.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 4 because it's their highest valued item.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 5 because it offers a unique item that balances the overall distribution.
6. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because it has high value for them.
7. Assign item 3 to agent 2 as the next highest value to balance allocations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items such that each agent receives items that are relatively valuable to them, while ensuring that all items are allocated.
