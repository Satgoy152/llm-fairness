Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40   4  26  70  46   4  19
1  65  30  31   1  84  20  35
2  59  45  21  81  29  82  21
3  45  77  53  58  63  61   6
4  30  25  69  62  51  30  56
5  52  16  59  32  67   6  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we examine the valuations and aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents while minimizing envy. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Start by calculating the total valuation each agent would have if they received all the items. This helps to understand the relative preferences of each agent.

2. Allocate items to agents such that each agent receives items that maximize their own valuation while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than their own.

3. Iterate through allocations and adjust to ensure that items are distributed fairly, with each agent having an integer number of items and no item being assigned to more than one agent.

Based on these principles, let's allocate the items:

**Allocations:**

- Agent 0 receives item 3 (valuation 70).
- Agent 1 receives item 4 (valuation 84).
- Agent 2 receives item 5 (valuation 82).
- Agent 3 receives item 1 (valuation 77).
- Agent 4 receives item 2 (valuation 69).
- Agent 5 receives items 0 and 6 (valuations 52 and 40, respectively).

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive by prioritizing their highest-valued items, ensuring that we maintain an integer allocation of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```
