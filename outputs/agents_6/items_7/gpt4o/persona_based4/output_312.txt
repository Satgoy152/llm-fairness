Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  75   3  48  16  40  56
1  34  25  11  29  84  78  71
2  56  75  74  44  12   4   3
3  55  16  32  70  13  20  61
4  89  59  10  25  86  84  40
5  62  76  42  37  49  97  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible, given the preferences of each agent for the items. One common approach to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" method, which involves iteratively assigning items to agents based on their highest preference until all items are allocated.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This initial allocation may not satisfy all fairness criteria, but it serves as a starting point.

2. **Adjust for Fairness**: If necessary, adjust the allocation to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation considering the constraints of envy-freeness.

Using the given valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 4 (value: 89)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value: 75)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (value: 74)
   - Item 3: Agent 3 (value: 70)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (value: 84)
   - Item 5: Agent 5 (value: 97)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (value: 71)

2. **Final Allocation**: Review the allocations to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and adjust if necessary for better balance:
   - Agent 0: [1]
   - Agent 1: [4, 6]
   - Agent 2: [2]
   - Agent 3: [3]
   - Agent 4: [0]
   - Agent 5: [5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. This balances the allocations based on the initial preferences and ensures that each agent has an item to reduce envy.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
