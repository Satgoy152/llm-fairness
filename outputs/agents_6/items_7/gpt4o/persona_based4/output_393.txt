Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  22  74  71  36  18  87
1  97  44  77  55  68  20  89
2  57  33  89  93  44   4  66
3  80  10   6  65  28  72  66
4  11  48  96   8  66  86  68
5  90  47  95  88  33  84  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible based on the given valuations. The goal is to allocate all 7 items to the 6 agents such that each agent's allocation is fair relative to their valuations.

First, let's look at the valuations:

```
Agents' valuations for items:
Agent 0: [51, 22, 74, 71, 36, 18, 87]
Agent 1: [97, 44, 77, 55, 68, 20, 89]
Agent 2: [57, 33, 89, 93, 44, 4, 66]
Agent 3: [80, 10, 6, 65, 28, 72, 66]
Agent 4: [11, 48, 96, 8, 66, 86, 68]
Agent 5: [90, 47, 95, 88, 33, 84, 81]
```

To start, let's consider allocating items by maximizing the agents' individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (97)
   - Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (48)
   - Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (96)
   - Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (93)
   - Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (66)
   - Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (86)
   - Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (87)

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 1: [0]
   - Agent 4: [1, 2, 4, 5]
   - Agent 2: [3]
   - Agent 0: [6]

3. **Reallocation to Ensure All Agents Get Items:**
   - Agent 3 and Agent 5 need items.
   - Re-evaluate to adjust allocations:
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation for item 1 is Agent 3 with 10).
     - Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (second highest valuation for item 2 is Agent 5 with 95).
   
4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [6]
   - Agent 1: [0]
   - Agent 2: [3]
   - Agent 3: [1]
   - Agent 4: [4, 5]
   - Agent 5: [2]

This approach attempts to maximize individual satisfaction with respect to each agent's highest valuation, subject to the constraint that each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
