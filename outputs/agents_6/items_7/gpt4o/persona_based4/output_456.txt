Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  45   1  22  91  21  11
1  71  39  10  64   4  45  26
2  96  10  92  54  31  12  38
3  56   5  60  78  29  53  42
4  73  79  64  63  18  26  58
5  18  24  20  36  69  13  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider how to allocate the 7 items such that no agent feels envy towards another, given their valuations. One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation, or at least as close as possible under the constraints, is using the "envy-free up to one item" (EF1) criterion. This means that any envy an agent might have can be eliminated by removing a single item from the envied agent's allocation.

Given the table of valuations, let's use a heuristic method to allocate the items:

1. Sort items based on their total value across all agents. This gives us a rough sense of which items are most valuable overall.
2. Allocate items to agents starting with those who value them the most, while trying to maintain balance and minimize potential envy.
3. Adjust the allocations as needed to ensure that all items are distributed and that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Letâ€™s go through the steps:

- **Item 4** has the highest combined value and is most valued by Agent 0. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2** is the next highest value for Agent 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 to balance allocations.
- **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 4. Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
- **Item 6** is most valued by Agent 5. Assign item 6 to Agent 5.
- **Item 5** is most valued by Agent 1. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 to balance allocations.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [3, 5]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [1]
- Agent 5: [6]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```
