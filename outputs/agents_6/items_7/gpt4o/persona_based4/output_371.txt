Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  59  41  13  47  52  86
1  26  98  99  93   8  27  66
2  82  91  16  49  85  85  80
3  39  92  21  60  56  14   8
4  15  47  58  62  78   5  32
5  62  82  49   5  84  74  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can employ an approach based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, we can follow a greedy strategy where each agent is assigned their most valued item that is still available. This approach does not guarantee envy-freeness but aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent is satisfied with at least one highly valued item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Most valued item is 6 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1**: Most valued item is 2 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2**: Most valued item is 1 (value 91).
4. **Agent 3**: Most valued item is 1 (value 92), but it is already taken. Next highest is 3 (value 60).
5. **Agent 4**: Most valued item is 4 (value 78).
6. **Agent 5**: Most valued item is 4 (value 84), but it is already taken. Next highest is 5 (value 74).

Now, the remaining unallocated items are 0 and 3. We distribute them to minimize overall envy further:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest value is 0 (value 70).
- **Agent 3**: Already has 3, so no further allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide each agent with at least one of their top-valued items, ensuring that the overall satisfaction across agents is balanced as much as possible.
