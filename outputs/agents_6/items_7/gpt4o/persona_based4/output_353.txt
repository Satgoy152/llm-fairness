Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  79  22  10  62  80  45
1  68  90  97  74   5  46  84
2  54  49  23  51  62  14  77
3  25  41  94  43  94  61  24
4  27  92  22  69  66  89  48
5   8  24   3  20  62  52  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure envy-freeness or at least minimize envy as much as possible. Since we have 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.
2. Try to allocate items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction and minimizes envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agents have the following total valuations for all items:
  - Agent 0: 393
  - Agent 1: 464
  - Agent 2: 330
  - Agent 3: 382
  - Agent 4: 413
  - Agent 5: 193

Considering these preferences, we should give the higher-value items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring no agent is significantly worse off than others.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 5] (Values: 95, 80)
- Agent 1: [2] (Value: 97)
- Agent 2: [6] (Value: 77)
- Agent 3: [4] (Value: 94)
- Agent 4: [1] (Value: 92)
- Agent 5: [3] (Value: 20)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and the distribution is balanced. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```
