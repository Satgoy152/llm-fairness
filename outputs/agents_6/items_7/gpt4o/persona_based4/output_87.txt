Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  65  64  12  65  35  95
1  98  82  42  82  86  85   3
2  97  82  98  31  85  43   9
3  19  48  48  43   2  89   6
4  99  81   0   0   8  29  89
5  96  65   9   3  57  64  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that involves maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while keeping allocations balanced.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to ensure fairness and minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values items highly at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest, followed by items 1, 3, 4, and 5.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest, followed by items 0, 1, and 4.
4. **Agent 3** has a more even distribution but values item 5 highly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the highest, followed by 1 and 6.
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 the highest, followed by items 1, 5, and 6.

Considering these preferences, an allocation can be made as follows:

- **Agent 0**: [6]
- **Agent 1**: [0]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [5]
- **Agent 4**: [1]
- **Agent 5**: [4, 3]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and their individual valuations for their allocated items are relatively high. Additionally, the total number of items allocated is 7, meeting the problem constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 3]
}
```
