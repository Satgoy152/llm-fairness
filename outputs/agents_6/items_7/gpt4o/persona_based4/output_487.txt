Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  42  71  61  48  79   9
1  15  25  37  88  75  13  56
2  80   2  38   5  62  31  76
3  32  92  51  35  57  54  62
4   4   7  46  96  17  83  57
5  77   3   4  88  73  12  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to achieve a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-free means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of any other agent. Since we have 6 agents and 7 items, it's important to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the perceived fairness based on the given valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 highest (79), followed by item 2 (71).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 highest (88), followed by item 4 (75).
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 highest (80), followed by item 6 (76).
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 highest (92), followed by item 6 (62).
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 highest (96), followed by item 5 (83).
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 highest (77), followed by item 3 (88).

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to minimize envy.
- Ensure that all 7 items are distributed and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

#### Proposed Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (high value and no conflict with other agents' highest).
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Agent 4 gets item 3 (highest value for Agent 4).
- Agent 5 gets item 6 (second-highest, as item 0 is taken).

### Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item they value highly, distributing the items fairly in context of the given valuations. Each agent's allocation is based on their preferences as much as possible, subject to the constraint of distributing 7 distinct items.
