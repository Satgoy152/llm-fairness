Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  19  78  85   7  76  21
1  38  96   7  66  99  76  76
2  89  76  90  92  90  25  53
3  65  49  94  36  30  21  23
4  83  30  73   9  84  42  49
5  87  28  92  15  24   2  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent's valuation is as high as possible given their preferences, and no agent envies another.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 but it's already taken, so we give them item 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2, but it's already taken, so we give them item 0.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0, but it's already taken, so we give them item 4.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 0 and 2, but both are taken, so we give them item 6.

Now, let's assign the remaining items to minimize envy:
- Agent 1 could also receive item 1 since it is their second-highest preference.
- Agent 5 could also receive item 5 as it gives them the next highest value available.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to minimize envy among agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```
