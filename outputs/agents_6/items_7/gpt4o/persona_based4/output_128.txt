Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  48  25  58  13  42  25
1  80  97  69  61   2  90  39
2  31  37  78  71  10   1  69
3  53  58  50  44  44  56  88
4  58  54   5  47  98  13  80
5   4  90   1  76  79  30  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with a focus on envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations, one approach is to try to maximize each agent's perceived value while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 (58) highly compared to other items. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 1 (97) the most. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 (78) the most. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 6 (88) the most. Assign item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 4 (98) the most. Assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 5 (90) the most. Assign item 5 to agent 5.
7. **Item 0**: This item remains. It has a relatively low value for most agents. Assign it to an agent with the least perceived total value. Here, agent 4 has a relatively high valuation for one item, so assigning item 0 to agent 0 can balance the perceived values a bit more.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution attempts to maximize perceived value based on the highest individual valuations for each agent.
