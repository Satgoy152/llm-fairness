Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93   3  28  30  37   5  52
1  37  95  58   2  67  73   9
2  41  89  90  51  50  94  86
3  68   9  99  71  15  18  67
4  87  16  12  67  26  30  15
5  77  51  18  38  60  12  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [77 51 18 38 60 12 82]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is as good as or better than the allocation received by any other agent based on their individual valuations. Given that there are more agents than items, not every agent will receive an item, but we can still try to maximize fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items in a manner that keeps envy to a minimum:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 0 (93)
   
2. **Item 1:**
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 1 (95)

3. **Item 2:**
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 3 (99)

4. **Item 3:**
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 3 (71) (Already has item 2, next highest is Agent 4 with 67)

5. **Item 4:**
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 1 (67) (Already has item 1, next highest is Agent 5 with 60)

6. **Item 5:**
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 2 (94)

7. **Item 6:**
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 2 (86) (Already has item 5, next highest is Agent 5 with 82)

Based on these allocations, we can derive the following assignment:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy where possible given the constraints.
