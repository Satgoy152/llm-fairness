Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  53  79  54  98  89  73
1  39  93  46  93  64  40  35
2  19  67  80  88  67  61  80
3  36  22  78  98  19  63  13
4  41  73  13   0  64  85  88
5  14  66  85  87   4  53  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize fairness, such as minimizing envy and/or maximizing total value for each agent based on their preferences.

One reasonable and straightforward approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest value each agent places on an unassigned item. We aim to distribute items such that each agent perceives they have received a valuable allocation according to their own valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Analysis:**  
   - There are 6 agents and 7 items.
   - Each agent should ideally get about 1 or 2 items since we cannot divide items further and must allocate all 7 items.

2. **Strategy:**  
   - Loop through the items and assign each item to the agent who values it the most among the remaining unassigned items.
   - Ensure no agent receives more than 2 items, as balancing is essential for fairness.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (62).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (93).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (79).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (98).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (98), but since Agent 0 already has 2 items, assign it to Agent 1 (64).
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most (85).
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most (88).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the valuation each agent places on the items they receive while considering the entire set of valuations.
