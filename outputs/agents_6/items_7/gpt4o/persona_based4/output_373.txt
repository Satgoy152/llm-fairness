Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84   0  77  57  21  72  63
1  67  54  93  57  88  61  90
2  19  64  24  14  73  52  19
3  11  72  64  19  38  46  27
4  90  65  74  72  54  65  86
5  20  61  79  34  40  74  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84  0 77 57 21 72 63]
 [67 54 93 57 88 61 90]
 [19 64 24 14 73 52 19]
 [11 72 64 19 38 46 27]
 [90 65 74 72 54 65 86]
 [20 61 79 34 40 74 31]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should consider the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, known as "maximin" fairness, and ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items in relation to their valuations. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the other five agents will receive one item each.

Based on the valuations provided in the table, let's proceed with the allocation to ensure fairness:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 highly (84). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 highly (93). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly (73). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 highly (72). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 highly (86). Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 5 highly (74). Assign item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, all agents have been assigned one item. Since there is one item left, item 3, we should assign it to an agent who will benefit the most from it without creating envy:

- **Agent 4** has a relatively high valuation (72) for item 3 compared to others. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

The final allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that is as fair as possible given their different valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 3],
    "5": [5]
}
```
