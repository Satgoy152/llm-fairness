Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  56  16  11  93   5  70
1  95  78   6   1  49  55  67
2  35  53  80   8  10  16  47
3  43  69   9  62  26  82  34
4   6  43  51  97  64  44  54
5  42  32  37  28  64  17   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will attempt to allocate items such that envy is minimized, meaning that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent. This isn't always perfectly possible, but we can aim to allocate items in a way that approximates this goal. Given the constraint of having 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one.

The goal is to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents. To do this, we can start by assigning each agent the item they value most highly. Then, we'll allocate the remaining items to further balance the overall satisfaction.

Here's one possible solution:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item, if possible.
2. Assign the remaining items to balance out the allocation as best as possible.

Based on the table, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (value 93).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value 95).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value 80).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (value 82).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (value 97).
- Agent 5 values item 4 the most, but it's already taken. Their next highest is item 0, but it's also taken. Next is item 4 again, so we need to find another item. We'll give them item 1, which is their next highest available option (value 32).

Now, the only item left is item 6. We will allocate it to the agent who has the lowest overall value from their current allocation. Let's see if we can distribute it to balance the overall value.

- Agent 0 has item 4 (value 93).
- Agent 1 has item 0 (value 95).
- Agent 2 has item 2 (value 80).
- Agent 3 has item 5 (value 82).
- Agent 4 has item 3 (value 97).
- Agent 5 has item 1 (value 32).

Agent 5 has the lowest total value, so we'll give them item 6, which they value at 6.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
