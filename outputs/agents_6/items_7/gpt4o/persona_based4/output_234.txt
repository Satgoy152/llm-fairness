Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  95  82  43  42  94  34
1  25  17   8  76  31  51   8
2  52  41  49  44  58  18  66
3  26  17  16  88  71  81  49
4  41  28  82  91  39  13  60
5  39  91  54  58  14  22  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints. Each agent should receive items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This can be challenging to achieve perfectly with integer allocations, but we will aim to minimize envy.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values items 1 and 5 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the most.

We will try to distribute items such that each agent gets something valuable according to their preferences:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as it is the highest-valued item for them.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as it is the highest-valued item for them.
3. Assign item 6 to agent 2, as it is the highest-valued item for them.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as it is the second highest-valued item available (after item 3).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 4, as it is valuable to them and previously unallocated.
6. Assign item 0 to agent 5, as the highest-valued unallocated item.

Now, we have allocated 6 out of 7 items. Since Agent 0 values item 4 and is left with only one item, we assign item 4 to agent 0.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation seeks to distribute items based on each agent's preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
