Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  67  76  95  88  33  62
1  88  52  48  28  48  36  88
2  41  90  35  52  17  34  16
3  24  66  14  31  57  57  27
4  77  59  37  89  76  41  14
5  43   0  43  13  62  54  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 6 agents, we will aim to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 0 and 6, so we allocate items 0 and 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a relatively high valuation for item 4, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and aims to minimize envy by assigning items based on the highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
