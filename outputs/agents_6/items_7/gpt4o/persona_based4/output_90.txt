Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  61  97   8   8  75  50
1  69  92   9  18   3  55  62
2  39  82  60  15  47  91  44
3  36  12  91  32  91   3   8
4  41  65  34  25  61  21  23
5  33  61  89  21  32  51  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free or as close to an envy-free allocation as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent feels they received a bundle of items at least as good as any other agent's bundle based on their own valuations.

Given the table of valuations, let's consider the following steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation Attempt**: Each agent can either be allocated their highest-valued item or items they value highly compared to others. This may not be perfect but it's a starting point.

2. **Adjustments for Fairness**: If any agent feels envious, we may need to adjust allocations by swapping items between agents to reduce any significant envy.

3. **Ensure Full Allocation**: Ensure all 7 items are allocated, with no item left unallocated, and no agent receiving more than their fair share given the total items available.

Let's compute a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 2 (97).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 1 (92).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 5 (91).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is items 2 and 4 (91), but 2 is allocated, so allocate item 4.
- **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 4 (61), but it’s allocated, next is item 1 (65), but it’s allocated, next is item 0 (41).
- **Agent 5**: Highest value is item 2 (89), but it’s allocated, next is item 5 (51), but it's allocated, next is item 1 (61), but it's allocated, next is item 6 (26).

Adjust the allocation to ensure each item is assigned:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 5.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 5.

This allocation tries to respect the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. Here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item they value highly. Adjustments can be made to further minimize envy if necessary.
