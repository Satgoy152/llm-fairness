Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  66  88  63  77  54  27
1  21  67  94  41  87   0   1
2  50  99  20  53  12  21  19
3  72  95  44  47  35  72  68
4  77  59  86  68  60   1  68
5  29  55  44  72  52  92  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. Given that each agent must receive an integer number of items and we have a total of 7 items, we will ensure that each agent receives at least one item or none, with the constraint that all 7 items are allocated.

One approach to achieve this is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which balances fairness and efficiency by maximizing the product of the agents' utilities. This method often helps achieve envy-freeness or approximate envy-freeness.

Here is a proposed allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 1 since they value it highly at 94.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2 since they value it the most at 99.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 5 since they value it at 72, which is relatively high compared to their other values.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 4 since they value it at 77, the highest among their other options.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3 since they value it at 35, which is not the highest, but it helps balance the allocation.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 5 since they value it at 92, the highest in their row.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 3 since they value it at 68, which is relatively high compared to their other options.

This allocation is intended to balance the total utility among the agents as fairly as possible.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```
