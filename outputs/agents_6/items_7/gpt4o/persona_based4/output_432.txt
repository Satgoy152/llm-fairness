Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  43  50  96  10  74  17
1  92  99  94  36  71  34  11
2  74  32  87  94  49  76  48
3  98   0  96  88  70  68  38
4  71  85  94  44  58  79  78
5  68  65  22  40   1  89   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, meaning that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as that of any other agent, according to their own valuation. We also want each agent to receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and find a way to distribute the items to balance these values.
2. Try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

**Analysis of valuations:**

- For each agent, identify the items with the highest valuations.
- Allocate items to balance the overall perceived value among agents.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 (value 96) to Agent 0. 
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (value 99) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 (value 87) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 (value 98) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 6 (value 78) to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 5 (value 89) to Agent 5.

Now, we have one remaining item (item 4) to allocate. We will allocate it to an agent that still maintains a fair distribution:

7. Allocate item 4 (value 71 for Agent 1) to Agent 1.

**Final Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items among the agents while ensuring that every item is allocated. Each agent receives an item with relatively high personal value, and we attempt to prevent envy by distributing the most valued items as equitably as possible.
