Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  17  14  61  46  34  25
1  88   4  64  91  39  26  61
2  10  95   4  97  45  56  90
3  38  87  60  57  45  47  23
4  29  46  43  86  38  94  60
5  47  88  82  29  89  10   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy. One common way to achieve this is by using the envy-free allocation approach, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Based on the valuations provided, let's try to allocate the items in a way that approximates fairness:

1. Start by determining the maximum value each agent assigns to any item, as this could be a candidate for their allocation.
2. Try to allocate the items such that each agent either receives their highest-valued item or a combination of items that maximizes their perceived value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (value 61).
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly as well (value 91), but since Agent 0 values it less, Agent 1 should get it.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly as well (value 97), but since Agent 1 already gets it, we look for another item for Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly (value 87).
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly (value 94).
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly (value 89).

Now, allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest values for each agent:

- Agent 0 can take item 0 (value 58).
- Agent 2 can take item 6 (value 90).
- Agent 5 can take item 2 (value 82).

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy by ensuring each agent receives items they value relatively highly.
