Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  69  31  88   7  54  63
1  72  44  52   2   6  52  10
2  89  24  54  64  32  18  56
3  91  63  60  99  31  45  21
4  26   7  37  23   8  21  18
5  12  13  25  41  20  95  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of achieving an envy-free distribution as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The challenge is to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than their own. Given that exact envy-freeness can be complex to achieve with integer allocations and discrete items, we aim for the most balanced and fair distribution possible.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items to get a rough estimate of each agent's preference intensity.
2. **Item Prioritization**: For each item, identify which agent values it the most, and consider allocating it to them.
3. **Balanced Allocation**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and try to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

Given these considerations, here's an allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 very highly (96), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (99), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest (95), so allocate item 5 to agent 5.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (54), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 1 values item 1 significantly (44), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 more than others (56), so allocate item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 4 has no strong preference, but to balance the allocation, assign item 4 with a relatively low value (8 to agent 4).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
