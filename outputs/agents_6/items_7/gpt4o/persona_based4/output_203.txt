Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  88  38  50   2  89  73
1  53  45  67  71  16  41  73
2  16  24  90  32  99  63  21
3  17  48  14  37  48  17  42
4  13   7  37  94  20  18   3
5  77  79  21  92  12  55  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations. One approach to achieve this is to allocate items to maximize each agent's minimum perceived value.

Using the valuations provided, we can attempt to allocate the items by assigning the item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 77 by agent 5.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 88 by agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 90 by agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 94 by agent 4.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 99 by agent 2. However, agent 2 already has an item, and we want to distribute items fairly. The next highest is 48 by agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 89 by agent 0. However, agent 0 already has an item, and agent 5 also has an item. The next highest is 63 by agent 2, who already has an item. Then it is 55 by agent 5, who already has an item. Next is 41 by agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 73 by agent 0. However, agent 0 already has an item, and agent 5 also has an item. The next highest is 73 by agent 1.

Now let's check if each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: 1 item (Item 1)
- Agent 1: 2 items (Items 5, 6)
- Agent 2: 1 item (Item 2)
- Agent 3: 1 item (Item 4)
- Agent 4: 1 item (Item 3)
- Agent 5: 1 item (Item 0)

The allocation can be considered envy-free and fair under these constraints. Now we'll present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.
