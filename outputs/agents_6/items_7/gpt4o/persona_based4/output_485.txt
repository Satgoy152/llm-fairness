Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  63  48  93  92  46  57
1  90  86  13   6  28  93  41
2  13  71  83   8  23  21  79
3  83  50  24  48   1  24  48
4  90  14  70  79  67  55   4
5  60  61  60   2  40  38  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation of the items. Given that we have 6 agents and 7 items, some agents may not receive any items. We will try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (93), so assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (90), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2 (83), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 0 (83), but since it's already taken, consider their next highest valued item, which is item 3 (48), but it's also taken. Next is items 0 and 6 (both valued at 48), so assign item 6 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 0 (90), but it's already taken. The next highest valued item is 3 (79), but it's also taken. Then, consider item 2 (70), which is taken. Next is item 4 (67), so assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 highly values items 0, 1, and 2 (all 60), but they are all taken. The next highest valued item is 1 (61), so assign item 1 to agent 5.

Now, we must allocate the remaining item:
- Item 5 is left unallocated. Considering Agent 1 has a high valuation of item 5 (93), assign item 5 to Agent 1.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring each item is allocated.
