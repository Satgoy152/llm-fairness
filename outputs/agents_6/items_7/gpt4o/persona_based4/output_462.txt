Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  20  25  92  14  10  91
1  92  97  50  34  46  29  24
2   4  94  42  60  59  41  53
3  35  97  66   2  45  58  72
4  27  46  31  44  83  70  38
5  56   0   3  46  55   4   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

One common approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin allocation method, where agents take turns choosing their most valued item that is still available. Given there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will end up with 2 items.

Let's simulate this process:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 3 (value 92).
   - Agent 1 selects item 1 (value 97).
   - Agent 2 selects item 1 (value 94) but it's taken, so selects item 3 (value 60).
   - Agent 3 selects item 1 (value 97) but it's taken, so selects item 6 (value 72).
   - Agent 4 selects item 4 (value 83).
   - Agent 5 selects item 0 (value 56).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 2 now selects item 2 (value 42) since 1 and 3 were taken.
   - Remaining items to allocate: 0, 5, and 6.

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 6 (value 91).

4. **Round 4:**
   - Agent 1 selects item 0 (value 92).

5. **Round 5:**
   - Agent 4 selects item 5 (value 70).

Now, let's compile the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has received items according to their highest preferences available during their turn, aiming for a fair distribution.
