Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  70   5  78  75  96  61
1  24  91  54  80  97  14  88
2  94  32  60  12  30  72  86
3  98  58  99  38  22  32  51
4   6  64  60  96  42  64  49
5  99  20  39  14  11  11  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This approach tries to maximize the product of utilities, which often leads to fair and envy-free allocations. Let's calculate this allocation step by step:

First, let's evaluate some potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on the items with the highest valuations for Agent 0.
   - Item 5 (Value: 96)

2. **Agent 1**: Focus on the items with the highest valuations for Agent 1.
   - Item 4 (Value: 97)

3. **Agent 2**: Focus on the items with the highest valuations for Agent 2.
   - Item 0 (Value: 94)

4. **Agent 3**: Focus on the items with the highest valuations for Agent 3.
   - Item 2 (Value: 99)

5. **Agent 4**: Focus on the items with the highest valuations for Agent 4.
   - Item 3 (Value: 96)

6. **Agent 5**: Focus on the items with the highest valuations for Agent 5.
   - Item 1 (Value: 20), Item 6 (Value: 48)

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents and ensure that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [1, 6]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item they highly value and should be envy-free. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
