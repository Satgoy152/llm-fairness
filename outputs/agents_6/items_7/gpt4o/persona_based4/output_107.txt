Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  92  14  42  21  73  28
1  12  73  40  21  68  62  79
2  45  24  29  61  75  85  23
3  61  32  18   5  67  53  88
4  91  24   1  76  40  25  60
5  50  11  20  52   4  74   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to look for a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. This problem can be approached through combinatorial optimization techniques, but given the constraints, I'll provide a heuristic solution.

First, let's look at the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 300
- Agent 1: 355
- Agent 2: 342
- Agent 3: 324
- Agent 4: 317
- Agent 5: 219

Now, we aim to distribute the 7 items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. I'll assign items to maximize each agent's perceived value while ensuring no agent envies another.

After evaluating the best distribution for the given valuations, here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 5] for a total value of 165.
- Agent 1 receives item [6] for a total value of 79.
- Agent 2 receives item [4] for a total value of 75.
- Agent 3 receives item [3] for a total value of 5.
- Agent 4 receives item [0] for a total value of 91.
- Agent 5 receives item [2] for a total value of 20.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the overall distribution takes into account the highest valuations for each agent where possible, thus minimizing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2]
}
```
