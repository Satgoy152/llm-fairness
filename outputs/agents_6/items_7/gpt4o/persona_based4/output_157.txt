Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  71  84  61  81  84  87
1  41  47  17  50  39  16  76
2  64  57  67  69  89  14  18
3   3  73  34  98  99   0  22
4  31  29  59  17  23  30  16
5  97  71  29   8   3  40  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that they value the allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. While perfect envy-freeness might not be possible with this setup, an attempt can be made to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with a simple allocation that takes into account the agents' preferences as reflected in their valuations. We'll aim to balance the total value each agent receives, given their valuations.

First, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 561
- Agent 1: 286
- Agent 2: 378
- Agent 3: 329
- Agent 4: 205
- Agent 5: 284

Now, let's aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value while balancing the number of items each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 6]
  - Total value: 93 + 87 = 180
- Agent 1 receives items: [3, 4]
  - Total value: 50 + 39 = 89
- Agent 2 receives items: [1]
  - Total value: 57
- Agent 3 receives items: [5]
  - Total value: 0
- Agent 4 receives items: [2]
  - Total value: 59
- Agent 5 receives items: []

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on the agents' preferences, while trying to balance the value obtained by each agent. Note that not all envy can be eliminated, but the allocation aims to minimize it.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
