Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  63  21  91  70  55  34
1   1  68  87  17  61  54  97
2  65  60  98  70  68  79  74
3  27  69  24   2  44  71  97
4  18  11  92  68  61  75  21
5  84   0  42  80   2  78  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, taking into account their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible. However, since there are more agents than items, not all agents will receive an item, and we must ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible under these constraints.

One approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, aiming to distribute the items such that no agent envies another's allocation based on their valuations. To achieve this, we can follow a simple procedure to allocate items to agents with the highest valuations strategically:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as they value it the highest (98).
2. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as they value it the highest (97).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as they value it the highest (71).
4. Assign item 0 to agent 5, as they value it the highest (84).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as they value it the highest (91).
6. Assign item 4 to agent 4, as they value it the highest (61).
7. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as they value it the second highest (63).

This distribution attempts to ensure that each agent gets an item they highly value and aims to reduce envy among them:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation is designed to minimize envy, given the constraints, by prioritizing high valuations for each item and distributing them among different agents.
