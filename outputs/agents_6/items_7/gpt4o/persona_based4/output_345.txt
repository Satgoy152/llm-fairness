Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  48  93  58  82  59  13
1  91  21  21  63  36  86  47
2  99  91  42  17  54  25  56
3  60  57   9  64  69  51   8
4  88  70  72  38  88  43  44
5  21   8   0   3  48  19  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share given their own valuations. The challenge is to distribute the 7 items among the 6 agents so that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Given the matrix of valuations, one possible approach is to allocate items in such a way that each agent maximizes their perceived value, ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 2 (93) and 4 (82). We can give item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 0 (91). We can give item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 0 (99) and 1 (91). Item 0 is already allocated, but item 1 is still available. We can give item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 3 (64). We can give item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 0 (88) and 4 (88). Item 4 is already allocated, but item 5 is still available. We can give item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value items are 4 (48), 6 (41), and 0 (21). Item 4 is already allocated, but item 6 is still available. We can give item 6 to Agent 5.

The allocation should be structured to meet the requirement of distributing exactly 7 items. Since we have one item left to allocate, we need to check if any agents can receive additional items without causing envy:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 0.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 3.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 5.
- **Agent 5**: Already has item 6.

Since we have not yet allocated item 2, which is valued highly by Agent 0, we can give item 2 to Agent 0 as well.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives an item(s) that they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated.
