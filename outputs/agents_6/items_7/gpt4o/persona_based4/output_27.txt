Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  97  63  91  63  96  76
1   5  65  87  18  28  79  48
2  22  30  81  59  54  72  68
3  70  83  59  48  94  45  55
4  23  83  31  75  17  81  40
5   8  51  92  85  26  53  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own, considering their valuations. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their preferences.

Given the valuations for each item by each agent, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest at 97. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest at 87. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest at 72. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the highest at 94. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest at 75. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 3 the highest at 85, but it is already taken by Agent 4. The next highest for Agent 5 is item 2, but it's taken by Agent 1. Next is item 5 at 53, but it is taken by Agent 2. We allocate item 6, which is valued at 31 by Agent 5.
7. **Agent 0** has the next highest value for item 0 (67) that is still available. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

After this allocation, every agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed. The distribution avoids envy as much as possible given the constraints. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```
