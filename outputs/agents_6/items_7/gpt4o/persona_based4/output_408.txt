Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  73  14  45  37  76  97
1  65  36  81  87  90  66   3
2  89  43  86  59  93  85  48
3  86  77  13  66  53  55  92
4  77   1  74  48  11  55  16
5  88  78  26  17  15   9  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we will utilize a strategy that considers each agent's valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Given the table of valuations, we can use an approach such as the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most-valued item from the remaining pool. This can help in achieving a reasonable level of fairness and envy-freeness.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 2** picks item 4 (value: 93).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 4, but since it's taken, they pick item 3 (value: 87).
3. **Agent 5** picks item 0 (value: 88).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 0, but since it's taken, they pick item 6 (value: 92).
5. **Agent 0** picks item 6, but since it's taken, they pick item 5 (value: 76).
6. **Agent 4** picks item 0, but since it's taken, they pick item 2 (value: 74).

Remaining items (1) are allocated to ensure all items are distributed:

7. **Agent 1** picks item 1 (value: 36).

Following this process, the allocation would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items according to their preferences as much as possible and all 7 items are allocated.
