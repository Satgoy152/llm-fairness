Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  16  98  35  63   2  22
1  20  25  99  19  27  83  69
2  64   9  75  96   4  35  86
3  98  17  35  88  66  35  83
4  95  25  22  47  25  54  46
5  24  18  24  21  31  49  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate items in a manner that maximizes each agent's satisfaction according to their own valuations.

Let's consider a simple approach to achieve an envy-free allocation by sequentially offering each agent the item they value the most, provided it hasn't been allocated yet.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is for item 2 (value = 98). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is for item 2, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 5 (value = 83). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is for item 3 (value = 96). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is for item 0 (value = 98). Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is for item 0, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 1 (value = 25) and item 4 (value = 25), but item 1 is a unique highest value not yet allocated. Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is for item 5, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 4 (value = 31). Allocate item 4 to Agent 5.

7. **Remaining Item (6)**: The remaining item is 6. The agent who values it the most among those who haven't received a second item is Agent 1 (value = 69). Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints and ensures that each agent receives at least one item, while no more than 7 items are allocated in total.
