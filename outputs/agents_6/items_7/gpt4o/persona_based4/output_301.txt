Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  32   7  16  83  14  89
1  44  51  72  50  13  33  45
2  37  86  97  44  76  10  65
3  44  53  96  29  84  30  76
4  56  25  31  91  12   3  44
5   4  38   7  81  82  67  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents in such a way that the allocation is fair, and ideally envy-free. Given the constraints, it's not guaranteed that an envy-free allocation is possible, but we can aim for a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations.

First, let's consider the valuations provided and aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their valuation while trying to minimize envy.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Receives item 6 (value: 89)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Receives item 2 (value: 72)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Receives item 1 (value: 86)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Receives item 4 (value: 84)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Receives item 3 (value: 91)

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Receives items 0 and 5 (values: 4, 67)

Let's ensure that each agent is accounted for and check that 7 items in total are allocated.

Now, let's format this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with at least one item they value highly, while distributing the total items evenly among the agents.
