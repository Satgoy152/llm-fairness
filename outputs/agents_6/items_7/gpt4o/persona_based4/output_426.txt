Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  82  97  89  73  85  84
1  77  99  70  54  52  71  62
2  70  61  54  36  59   5  25
3  22  20  19   7  96   5  71
4  30  87  76  82  20  25  58
5  49  21  69  47  49  81  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that aims to minimize envy and be as fair as possible, we can use a method that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives. Given there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will get 1 item each. The goal is to make the allocation such that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as high as possible, while also ensuring no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

To achieve this, we can use a simple greedy algorithm where we allocate items to agents based on maximizing their perceived value while keeping track of the total value assigned to each agent:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Sort the items based on how much each agent values them.
3. Allocate items iteratively to agents, prioritizing agents who have received lower total value so far.

Let's work through this process:

1. Calculate total valuation of items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 43 + 82 + 97 + 89 + 73 + 85 + 84 = 553
   - Agent 1: 77 + 99 + 70 + 54 + 52 + 71 + 62 = 485
   - Agent 2: 70 + 61 + 54 + 36 + 59 + 5 + 25 = 310
   - Agent 3: 22 + 20 + 19 + 7 + 96 + 5 + 71 = 240
   - Agent 4: 30 + 87 + 76 + 82 + 20 + 25 + 58 = 378
   - Agent 5: 49 + 21 + 69 + 47 + 49 + 81 + 31 = 347

2. Assign items focusing on maximizing perceived value for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (97)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (99)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (70)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (96)
   - Agent 4: Item 3 (82)
   - Agent 5: Item 5 (81)

3. Assign the remaining item to the agent with the lowest total value:
   - Remaining item: Item 6
   - Agent 3 has the lowest total value so far, so they receive Item 6 (71)

Now, all 7 items have been allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```
