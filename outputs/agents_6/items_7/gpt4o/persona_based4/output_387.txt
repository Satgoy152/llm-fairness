Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  94  29  39  73  90   2
1   8   9  84  70  27  19  73
2  40  25  28  42  82  27  11
3   8  81  18  11  30  15  18
4  61   6  45  66  89  24  38
5  37  95   2  81  68  98   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division, we must allocate all 7 items to the 6 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is as envy-free as possible. Given the valuations, our goal is to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the perceived value each agent gets, thereby minimizing envy.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item and consider allocating those items to those agents to maximize their satisfaction.

2. Ensure that no agent goes without items where possible, and try to balance the perceived value across agents.

Hereâ€™s the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (value of 94), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly (value of 84), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly (value of 82), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly (value of 81), but it is taken. The next highest is item 0 (value of 8), which is not ideal. However, agent 5 values item 1 the most, so we give agent 3 item 5 (value of 15 to agent 3).
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly (value of 89), but it's taken. The next highest is item 3 (value of 66), so give agent 4 item 3.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly (value of 98), so allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, we have 1 item left, item 0, which can be allocated to Agent 4, as it provides them with additional value and they have fewer high-value options left.

After these considerations, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 0],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, with the total number of items allocated being 7.
