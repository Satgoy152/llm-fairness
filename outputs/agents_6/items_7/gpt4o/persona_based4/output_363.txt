Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  35  82  13  47  93  45
1  84  49  12  35  95  45  77
2  94  39  23  88  91   2   3
3  43  67  94  53  11  21   5
4  84  94  65  61  10  50  30
5  49  13  54  84  44  47  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents, we'll use the concept of maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation. An allocation is considered fair if it minimizes envy, meaning each agent's allocation is as valuable to them as possible, given the constraints.

Agents' valuations for each item are given in the table. The goal is to distribute all 7 items among the 6 agents such that each agent has an integer number of items, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

Let's evaluate the items and attempt a distribution:

1. **Agent 0** has high value in item 0 (92) and item 5 (93).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (95) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (94) highly but should not cause too much envy with Agent 0.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 (94) highly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 (94) highly.
6. **Agent 5** has a moderate distribution of values, with item 3 (84) being the highest.

Considering these valuations, we can attempt to allocate items to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 (93)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (95)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (88)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 2 (94)
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 1 (94)
- **Agent 5**: Allocate item 0 (49) and item 6 (25)

This allocation seeks to give each agent the highest possible value, considering their preferences and minimizing potential envy among agents.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```
