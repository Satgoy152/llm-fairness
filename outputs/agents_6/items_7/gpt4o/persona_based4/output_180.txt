Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  37  22  14  15  35  92
1  26  95   4  84  97  21  84
2  15  68  10  27  89  24  32
3  96  97  79  85   9  39  46
4  37  31  86  41  50  67  94
5   4  38  28  47  54  34  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach for fair division is to attempt to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items and ensure that no agent envies another's allocation.

Given the table and the need to allocate 7 items to 6 agents, there will be one agent with one more item than the others. We will focus on distributing the items such that the difference in valuations among agents is minimized.

Let's consider the following approach:
1. Evaluate each agent's highest valued items.
2. Allocate items starting from the highest valuation, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure fairness and minimize envy.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the highest (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest (97).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (89) but already taken, so the next highest is item 1 (68).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest (97) but already taken, so the next highest is item 0 (96).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 the highest (94) but already taken, so the next highest is item 2 (86).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 3 the highest (47).

### Adjusting for unallocated items:
- Re-evaluate to distribute remaining items: 
  - After the first allocation, item 5 is unallocated. Since Agent 5 has only one item, give item 5 to Agent 5, as it has the next highest valuation for them (34).

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items and their valuations across agents.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution minimizes perceived envy based on their highest valuations.
