Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15   3  30  58  80  93  30
1  78  86  55  56  89  39  89
2  44  66  21  86  60  63  40
3  55  43  44  13   2  53  54
4  16  75   4  16  75  84  10
5  54   2   2  43  37  86  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the maximin share approach. This involves trying to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Given this setup, we can attempt to distribute the items such that no agent feels envy towards another agent. The goal is to make sure each agent's allocation is as fair as possible according to their preferences.

Let's analyze the situation and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest (93).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (89) and item 6 equally (89).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest (86).
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest (55).
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 and item 4 equally (75).
6. **Agent 5** values item 5 the highest (86).

Now, we attempt to allocate items in a fair manner:

- **Agent 0** can receive item 5 (93).
- **Agent 1** can receive item 4 (89).
- **Agent 2** can receive item 3 (86).
- **Agent 3** can receive item 0 (55).
- **Agent 4** can receive item 1 (75).
- **Agent 5** can receive item 6 (29).
- The remaining item, item 2 (30), can be allocated to **Agent 0** as it increases their satisfaction without causing envy.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. It aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints and the values provided by each agent.
