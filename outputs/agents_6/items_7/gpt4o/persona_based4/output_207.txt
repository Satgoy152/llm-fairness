Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  58   2  62  91  56  68
1   8  42  90  93  46  56  24
2  80  26  45  84  46  66  20
3   3  33  94  40   6  14  30
4  80  25  51  49  29  97  99
5  59  29  73  13  10   4   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. To approach this, we can use the maximum envy-free allocation method. Let's first calculate the total valuation for each agent to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0: 61 + 58 + 2 + 62 + 91 + 56 + 68 = 398
- Agent 1: 8 + 42 + 90 + 93 + 46 + 56 + 24 = 359
- Agent 2: 80 + 26 + 45 + 84 + 46 + 66 + 20 = 367
- Agent 3: 3 + 33 + 94 + 40 + 6 + 14 + 30 = 220
- Agent 4: 80 + 25 + 51 + 49 + 29 + 97 + 99 = 430
- Agent 5: 59 + 29 + 73 + 13 + 10 + 4 + 6 = 194

Next, we distribute the items to minimize envy. A common strategy is to prioritize giving high-value items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item to maintain fairness.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value: 80).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value: 58).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value: 94).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value: 93).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value: 91).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (highest value: 97).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (highest value: 99).

This allocation tries to satisfy the highest valuation preference for each item while ensuring all items are allocated. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
