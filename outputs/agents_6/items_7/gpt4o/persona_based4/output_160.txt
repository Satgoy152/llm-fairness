Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  20  24  52  89   7  10
1  65   0  12  18  50  11  30
2  47  60  41  45   0   6  76
3  64  71  94  66   8  71  26
4  60  63  16  93  39   3   2
5  53  74  95  38  57  96  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In fair division problems, especially with indivisible goods, achieving a perfectly envy-free allocation can be challenging. However, we can aim for a fair allocation by minimizing envy and ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable portion of their valued items.

To proceed, I'll implement an allocation strategy based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's consider the table provided:

```
0  87  20  24  52  89   7  10
1  65   0  12  18  50  11  30
2  47  60  41  45   0   6  76
3  64  71  94  66   8  71  26
4  60  63  16  93  39   3   2
5  53  74  95  38  57  96  67
```

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation for Each Agent:** Assign each agent the item they value the most if it hasn't been assigned yet.

2. **Resolve Conflicts:** If multiple agents value the same item the most, assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation and then proceed to their next highest valued item.

3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:** Continue assigning remaining items to agents who value them next highest until all items are allocated.

Now, let's determine the allocation using the strategy above:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most: Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most: Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most: Assign item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most: Assign item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most: Assign item 3 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most: Assign item 5 to agent 5.

Now, item 1 is left unallocated. Agent 5 values it second highest after item 5, so assign item 1 to agent 5.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items and attempts to reflect each agent's preferences as much as possible.
