Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13   4  17  37  83  68   1
1  75   6   2  84  92  65  74
2  27  25  39  50  93  89  36
3  71  73  99  99  73  85  39
4  39  94   6  23   1  45  37
5  92  31  40  79  99  55   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, while trying to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation. There are multiple methods to achieve this, such as the "Envy-Free" method, but due to the limited number of items (7) and agents (6), we need to allocate in such a way that each agent gets at least one item or none, depending on the optimization of their valuations.

First, let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [13, 4, 17, 37, 83, 68, 1]
- Agent 1: [75, 6, 2, 84, 92, 65, 74]
- Agent 2: [27, 25, 39, 50, 93, 89, 36]
- Agent 3: [71, 73, 99, 99, 73, 85, 39]
- Agent 4: [39, 94, 6, 23, 1, 45, 37]
- Agent 5: [92, 31, 40, 79, 99, 55, 3]

Let's allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. Agent 3 highly values item 2 (99) and item 3 (99). Assign these to Agent 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4 (92). Assign this to Agent 1.
3. Agent 5 highly values item 0 (92). Assign this to Agent 5.
4. Agent 4 highly values item 1 (94). Assign this to Agent 4.
5. Agent 2 highly values item 5 (89). Assign this to Agent 2.
6. Item 6 is left, and Agent 1 values it at 74. Assign this to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that agents receive items they value highly, thus reducing envy. Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```
