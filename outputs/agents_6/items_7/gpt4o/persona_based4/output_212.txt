Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  14  46  14  34  97  19
1  10  47  61  76  79  94  53
2  18   4  51  66  76  17   9
3  53  57  32  49  54  98   2
4  70  92  66  20  25  61  25
5   0  18  41   7  87  59  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents based on the given valuations, we will employ a method that aims to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness is achieved when no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given that there are only 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, and we must balance this allocation carefully to minimize envy.

Here is a possible allocation of the items that considers the valuations and aims to be as fair as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation on item 5.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations on items 3 and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Moderate valuations on items 2 and 3.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation on item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation on item 1.
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation on item 4.

Following these observations, here is a fair allocation of the items:

- Agent 0: [5] (value 97)
- Agent 1: [3, 4] (values 76, 79)
- Agent 2: [2] (value 51)
- Agent 3: [0] (value 53)
- Agent 4: [1] (value 92)
- Agent 5: [6] (value 28)

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that reflects the preferences of the agents and minimizes envy. Now let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```
