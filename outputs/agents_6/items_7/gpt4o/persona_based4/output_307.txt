Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  80  76  97  70  42   0
1  90  12  37  84  66  61  31
2  30  57  50  82  78  75  43
3  64  15  40  82  22  21  90
4  98  83  53  29  20  73  23
5  84  17  46  32  45  47  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, the goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuation, considering the constraints. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive more than one item. The allocation should be such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

One approach to achieve this is by using the "maximum envy-freeness" principle, where we try to minimize the maximum envy any agent might have. We can also consider the "max-min fair share" approach, which ensures each agent gets at least their fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation that considers these principles:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items iteratively, starting with the agent who values an item the most, while ensuring that no agent receives less than their fair share if possible.

Here's an allocation that adheres to these principles:

- Agent 0 highly values items 3 and 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most, but it is already allocated to Agent 0, so we allocate item 3 instead.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most but item 3 is already allocated, so we allocate item 5 instead.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly, but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 1.
- Agent 5 values item 6 highly, but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 3, which they value the highest.
- Agent 1 gets an item that maximizes their remaining value.
- Agent 2 receives item 5, which is one of their higher-valued items.
- Agent 3 receives item 6, which they value the most.
- Agent 4 gets item 1, which is among their higher-valued items.
- Agent 5 receives items 2 and 0, balancing their overall valuation satisfaction. 

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly based on the given valuations.
