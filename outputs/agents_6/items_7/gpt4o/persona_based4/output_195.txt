Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  20  12  45  84   1  22
1  91  56  12  19  65  49  70
2  47  42  11  22  23  61  66
3  78  69  99  80   3  74  39
4  47  54  78  61  98  85  41
5  27  29  39  87  70  92  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 42 11 22 23 61 66]

 [27 29 39 87 70 92 82]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, we will try to balance the value each agent receives based on their own valuations. Here is one possible allocation of the items:

1. **Agent 0**: We aim to give Agent 0 the items they value the most.

2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, allocate items that are of high value to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Ensure Agent 2 has items they value significantly.

4. **Agent 3**: Assign items to Agent 3 that contribute to a fair total value.

5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items that Agent 4 values highly.

6. **Agent 5**: Assign items to Agent 5 to ensure they receive a fair share.

After evaluating the table, here is a fair allocation that seeks to provide a balanced value to each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (value 84)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 91)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (value 61)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value 99)
- **Agent 4**: Item 3 (value 61)
- **Agent 5**: Item 6 (value 82)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (value 56) (Note: Avoiding envy by optimizing the allocation)

This allocation ensures that agents receive items that maximize their valuations while each agent receives exactly one item, leading to a total of 7 items allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```
