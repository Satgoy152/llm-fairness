Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  13   6  54  85  49   4
1  16  95  58  32  70  18  26
2  46  55  81  25  43  83   0
3  39  99   9  17  21  37  90
4  70  86  73   4  37  92  23
5  12  54  96  73  68  79  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the individual preferences (valuations) of each agent for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List all valuations**: Start by listing the valuations each agent has for each item. This has already been provided in the table.

2. **Use a fair division algorithm**: One common method for allocating indivisible goods fairly is the "round-robin" method or a "greedy" allocation. Given the constraints and the need for an integer number of items per agent, this method can work effectively.

3. **Allocate items**:

   - **Round 1**: Assign each agent their most valued available item.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**: Continue assigning remaining items to agents based on their next highest preferences, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. If all agents have at least one item, proceed to allocate remaining items based on the highest preference among remaining options.

Letâ€™s proceed with the allocation based on these principles:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highest (85).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highest (95).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highest (83).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highest (99), but already taken, so next highest available is item 6 (90).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 5 highest (92), but already taken, so next highest available is item 1 (86).
- **Agent 5**: Values item 2 highest (96).

Now, the remaining items are [0, 3]. We allocate these based on the next highest valuations among remaining options:

- **Agent 2**: Takes item 3 (25), as it's the next highest available.
- **Agent 0**: Takes item 0 (21).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and respects their highest available preferences.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This distribution ensures at least partial envy-freeness by respecting the highest available preferences of each agent given the constraints.
