Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8   2  25  90   6  52  59
1  93  85   6  47  70  47   6
2   2  94  20  12  39  46   5
3  30  59  61  82   5  72  35
4  79   8  72   1  21  18  54
5  24  21  40   8  81  19  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that ideally, each agent should prefer their allocation over any other agent's allocation based on their valuations. Given the constraints of integer allocation and the fact that we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will end up with one more item than others.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:**
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly (93).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 highly (94).
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly (90).

2. **Initial High-Value Item Assignment:**
   - Assign item 0 to agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 0.

3. **Consider Remaining Items:**
   - Items left: 2, 4, 5, 6.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 highly, but it is already allocated. Next high value is item 5 (72).
   - Agent 4 values item 2 highly (72).
   - Agent 5 values item 4 highly (81).

4. **Allocate Based on Remaining Preferences:**
   - Assign item 5 to agent 3.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 4.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 5.

5. **Address Any Remaining Items:**
   - Item 6 is left unallocated.
   - Agent 0 values item 6 moderately (59).
   - Assign item 6 to agent 0 as it complements their existing allocation.

### Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy high-value preferences for each agent and distribute the items such that envy is minimized as much as possible given the constraints.
