Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  82  19  81   6  39  93
1  48  93   7  68  66  69  42
2  95  56  47  18  71  96  90
3   0  13  50  38  77  55  79
4  40  25  48  42  59  16  49
5  59  38  96  19  57  43  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure an envy-free distribution while respecting the preferences and valuations of each agent. We'll use a strategy to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive. We'll try to minimize envy by allocating items in such a way that each agent feels they aren't missing out on a better bundle that another agent received.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Each agent values certain items more than others. We will prioritize giving each agent an item they value highly if possible.

2. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive more than one item. We'll distribute items considering each agent's highest preferences first and then proceed to the next best options.

Here's a potential allocation based on the table provided:

- **Agent 0**: Receives item 0 (valuation 94) and item 6 (valuation 93).
- **Agent 1**: Receives item 1 (valuation 93).
- **Agent 2**: Receives item 5 (valuation 96).
- **Agent 3**: Receives item 4 (valuation 77).
- **Agent 4**: Receives item 2 (valuation 48).
- **Agent 5**: Receives item 3 (valuation 19).

This allocation is structured to give each agent one of their highest-valued items, with Agent 0 receiving an additional item due to its high valuation preference.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least their top preference where possible, thereby minimizing envy and maximizing fairness in the distribution.
