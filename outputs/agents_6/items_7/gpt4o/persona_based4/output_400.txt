Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  69  89  59  73  84  66
1  80  73  31  54  55   9  51
2  53  54  39  82  20  35   8
3  48  76  96  95   9   9  29
4  60  98  77  25  87  97  72
5  64  31  76  56  95  98  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation is as close as possible to their highest valued items without creating envy among the agents. Given that there are more agents than items, not all agents will receive an item. The goal here will be to maximize the total utility while ensuring fairness.

The matrix provided gives the valuations for each agent and item:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  69  89  59  73  84  66
1  80  73  31  54  55   9  51
2  53  54  39  82  20  35   8
3  48  76  96  95   9   9  29
4  60  98  77  25  87  97  72
5  64  31  76  56  95  98  61
```

To achieve an allocation, we will consider the highest valuations and try to assign each item to the agent who values it most, while ensuring no item is assigned more than once and exactly seven items are allocated in total.

### Allocation Plan

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 80 (highest).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it at 98 (highest).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it at 96 (highest).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it at 95 (second highest after item 2 for agent 3).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 5 values it at 95 (highest).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it at 98 (highest).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 66 (highest available after above allocations).

### Allocations

Based on the above plan, here is the json format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, or among the highest available options after the prior allocations, aiming to reduce envy and ensure fairness.
