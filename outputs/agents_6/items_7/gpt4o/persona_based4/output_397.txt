Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  71  50  36  98  13  98
1  71   4   3  91  74  42   9
2  87   3  83   7  56  36  83
3  72  21  61  42  46  44  25
4  93  98  61  22   4  52  16
5  40  35  52  10  70  81  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to maintain envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a collection of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 4 and 6 highly (valuation of 98 each). Let's assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 the most (valuation of 71). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 0 the most (valuation of 87), but since it's already taken, assign item 2 (valuation of 83) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 the most (valuation of 72), but since it's taken, assign item 5 (valuation of 44) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 1 the most (valuation of 98). Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 5 the most (valuation of 81), which is taken, so assign item 3 (valuation of 10) to Agent 5.

Now, we need to assign the remaining item:

- **Agent 0**: Can also receive item 6 (valuation of 98), as they have the highest valuation for it and they only have one item so far.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```
