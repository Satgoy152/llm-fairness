Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19   2  61  56  52   0  99
1  26  77  43  53  46  58  34
2  30  88  90  74  79  46  10
3  18  21  32  42  49  72  75
4   8  37  23  46  35  26   8
5  98  88  46  56  39  23  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation. One approach to achieve this is by maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Given the valuations matrix, let's allocate the items in a way that tries to minimize envy and maximize fairness. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will get two items, and the rest will receive one item each.

Let's go through the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 6 (99).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (77).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (90).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (72).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 3 (46).
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 0 (98).

This leaves item 4 unallocated. We need to allocate this to one of the agents who would benefit most from an additional item. Let's consider:

- Agent 3 also values item 4 moderately (49), which is the highest among the unallocated items.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by allowing each agent to receive one of the items they value highly, with Agent 3 receiving an additional item they also value reasonably well.
