Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  84  20  94  74   3  40
1  81  83  57  20   2  74  88
2  47  97  91  12  30  63  30
3  42  68   8  54  70  39  90
4  40  86  96  14  67  61  41
5  74  35  10  68  31  93   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, and to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, and we must try to balance the allocations as equitably as possible based on the given valuations.

Hereâ€™s a potential fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 3 (94), followed by item 1 (84). We can give Agent 0 item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6 (88). Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most (97). Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 6 (90), but it's already taken. Their next highest is item 4 (70). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 2 (96). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5's highest valuation is item 5 (93). Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

At this point, all agents have received one item except for Agent 0, who has received item 3. We still have one item left, item 0.

To complete the assignment:

- **Allocate item 0 to Agent 5**, since Agent 5 values item 0 (74) reasonably high and to ensure everyone gets an integer number of items.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5, 0]
}
```
