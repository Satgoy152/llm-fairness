Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  42  14  83  33  59  94
1  32  81   2  20  89  62  51
2  36  73  41  23  72  88  26
3  81  34  64  85   2  44  55
4  99  20  22  70  29  37  31
5   0  50  50  18  93  35  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for a solution that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives at least one item, while taking into account the preferences expressed in their valuations.

Given the table of valuations, we can attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes the sum of valuations each agent receives, thus minimizing potential envy. Let's proceed with a round of allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valued item: Item 6 (Value: 94)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valued item: Item 1 (Value: 81)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (Value: 88)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (Value: 85)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (Value: 99)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5:** 
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (Value: 93)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 5.

We have allocated 6 items so far. The remaining item is Item 2. We will allocate this based on the remaining preferences:

- **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation for Item 2 (Value: 41).

Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we have allocated all 7 items. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation maximizes individual preferences to the extent possible and aims to minimize envy amongst the agents.
