Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  12  17  58  10  27  61
1  35  20  64  95  16  47  62
2  88  49  53  34  29  67  34
3  58  13  59  98  32  78  36
4  63  49  25  40   0  95  96
5  78  59  37  43  24  90  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the six agents, we aim for a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. We will consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest preference: Item 0 (62), Item 6 (61)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0 to fulfill one of their high preferences.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest preference: Item 3 (95), Item 2 (64)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 as their top choice.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest preference: Item 0 (88), Item 5 (67)
   - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 2; allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest preference: Item 3 (98), Item 5 (78)
   - Since Item 3 is already allocated, allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest preference: Item 6 (96), Item 5 (95)
   - Both Items 5 and 6 are allocated; next best is Item 4 (40)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest preference: Item 5 (90), Item 0 (78)
   - Since Item 5 is allocated, allocate Item 1 (59) to Agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items, ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Let's allocate the remaining items based on the next highest preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Allocate Item 2 (highest remaining value for Agent 1) to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 3 (remaining unallocated) to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and preferences are respected as much as possible.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
