Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  28  68  28  11  78  55
1  75  84  63  79  16  55  65
2  98  29  44  72  76  74   5
3  83  57  72  12  75  20  63
4  34  95  22  93  30  39  49
5  75  40  60  45  31  47  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation where each agent receives items in such a way that minimizes envy. Here, I'll implement the "envy-free" criterion to the best extent possible given the constraints:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We have 6 agents and 7 items. This means one agent can receive two items while others receive one.
   - We aim to maximize individual satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by identifying items with the highest valuation for each agent.
   - Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
   - Distribute the remaining item to minimize envy.

3. **Applying the Strategy:**

   - **Agent 2** values item 0 the most at 98.
   - **Agent 0** values item 5 the most at 78.
   - **Agent 1** values item 1 the most at 84.
   - **Agent 4** values item 3 the most at 93.
   - **Agent 5** values item 6 the most at 92.
   - **Agent 3** values item 0 the most, but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 2. Next highest is item 2 at 72.

Now, there is one item left (item 4) that hasn't been assigned yet. We need to assign this item to minimize envy:

   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 76, which is the highest unallocated value, but Agent 2 already has an item.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as they value it fairly high at 30 compared to other unallocated agents.

4. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing each agent's satisfaction with the items they value most, with the remaining item assigned to reduce potential envy.
