Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  83   7  41  95  51  43
1  57  16  28  60  38  76  48
2  53  61  60  49  61  73  33
3  17  48  78  34  59  52  45
4  61  80  46  82  43  66  24
5  96  30  46  36  80  33  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we can utilize a fair division algorithm, such as the adjusted winner procedure or maximum marginal utility approach. Here, I'll use a simple heuristic based on maximum marginal utility, which aims to allocate items to the agent who values them the most at each step, ensuring that no agent is entirely left out if possible.

First, let's list the items in descending order of their highest valuation by any agent:

1. Item 0: Agent 5 values it at 96
2. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 95
3. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 83
4. Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 76
5. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 43
6. Item 3: Agent 4 values it at 82
7. Item 2: Agent 3 values it at 78

Now, allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 5
- Item 4 goes to Agent 0
- Item 1 goes to Agent 0
- Item 5 goes to Agent 1
- Item 6 goes to Agent 5
- Item 3 goes to Agent 4
- Item 2 goes to Agent 3

Here is the allocation of items in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's valuation and ensure that all items are allocated. Note that Agent 2 did not receive any items in this allocation, but this is a common outcome in fair division when the total number of items is not evenly divisible by the number of agents.
