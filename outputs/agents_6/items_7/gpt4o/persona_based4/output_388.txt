Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  63  79  99  17  18  37
1   5  75  58  87  15  12  50
2  64  37  91  33   7  49  31
3  92  65  12  74  43  86  67
4   5  56  73  96  15  89  49
5  12  72  72  57  14  42  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "adjusted winner procedure" or a similar fair division algorithm. However, since we only need to allocate a total of 7 items, we can aim for each agent to get at least one item if possible, ensuring that the allocation respects the given valuations as much as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 (valued at 99) to agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for agent 0.
2. Assign item 1 (valued at 75) to agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 (valued at 91) to agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for agent 2.
4. Assign item 0 (valued at 92) to agent 3, as it is the highest valued item for agent 3.
5. Assign item 5 (valued at 89) to agent 4, as it is the highest valued item for agent 4.
6. Assign item 4 (valued at 14) to agent 5, as it is the highest valued remaining item for agent 5.

We need to assign one more item to ensure all 7 items are allocated. Since agent 1 has the second-highest valuation for item 6 (valued at 50), we can assign item 6 to agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to minimize envy based on the highest individual item valuations.
