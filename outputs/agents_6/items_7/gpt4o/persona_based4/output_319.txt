Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  89  48  49  89   8  42
1  99  87  46  91  16  54   7
2  33  16   9  40  62  75  95
3  62   2  58  76  13  94  94
4   6  94  18  70  19  42  34
5   0  13   0  24  82  65  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy, we can start by examining the valuations and looking for a balanced way to distribute the items, keeping in mind the preferences of each agent.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Observations**:
    - Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 4.
    - Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 3.
    - Agent 2 highly values item 6.
    - Agent 3 highly values items 3, 5, and 6.
    - Agent 4 highly values item 1.
    - Agent 5 highly values item 4 and 6.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
    - Start by allocating the most valued items to each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one of their top preferences.
    - Ensure all items are distributed and each agent ends up with at least one item to maintain fairness and minimize envy as much as possible.

3. **Proposed Allocation**:
    - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4, as it is their highest value.
    - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
    - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
    - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2, as it is their highest value.
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 5.
    - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, as they value it highly and can balance their allocation.
    - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it is among their higher valued items and they need an allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and attempts to minimize envy by taking into account the highest valued items for each agent.
