Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  65  79  44  88  84  86
1  80  78  28   4  55  84   1
2   5  61  39  87  69  77  23
3  31   5  16   0  31  24  85
4  89  86  87  62  46  54  63
5  98  99  51   6  59  18  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll aim to distribute items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here's a suggested allocation method based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent and balancing the distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 4, 5, and 6. We'll assign:
   - Item 0 (value 83)
   - Item 5 (value 84)

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 doesn't have strong preferences except for item 1, which is valued at 78, and item 5, valued at 84. To avoid conflicts with Agent 0, we'll assign:
   - Item 1 (value 78)

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 highly (87). We'll give:
   - Item 3 (value 87)

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 6 highly (85). We'll assign:
   - Item 6 (value 85)

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. We'll assign:
   - Item 2 (value 87)

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 has the highest total valuation for item 4 and item 1. To avoid conflicts with other allocations, we'll assign:
   - Item 4 (value 59)

This distribution attempts to give the highest valued items to agents based on their preferences while keeping the distribution fair and envy-free.

Here is the allocation presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4]
}
```
