Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  22  82  74  58   8  41
1  22  20  87  18  74  23  46
2  95  26  36  53  71  46   8
3  52  71  58  73  77  21   1
4  43  72  33  55  49  91  40
5  65  56  83  15  83  81  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. We are given the valuations of 6 agents for 7 items. 

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a greedy algorithm approach, where we allocate items iteratively based on maximizing the minimum envy. This means we try to give each agent the item that they value the most, without creating envy among other agents.

Here's one possible allocation of items to agents, aiming to be as envy-free as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item or is explicitly represented with an empty list:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (value 82)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (value 74)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 95)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 73)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (value 91)
- Agent 5: Item 1 (value 56)
- Remaining item (Item 6 with value 41) can be allocated to Agent 0, as they have the least value currently.

This allocation is done by considering each agent's highest-valued item that has not yet been allocated, iteratively:

- Check which unallocated item each agent values the most.
- Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most and has not yet received an item.
- Repeat until all items are allocated.

Now, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
