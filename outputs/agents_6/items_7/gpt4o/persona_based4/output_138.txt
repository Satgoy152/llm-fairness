Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  76  29  25  71  32  20
1  77  79  13  18   0  48  26
2   4  11  53  37  46  86  51
3  86  99  87   4  67  81  14
4  87  70  81  65  51  84  70
5  62  86  27  62  82   5  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 6 agents and 7 items, we can allocate some agents 1 item each and some 2 items each. The goal is to balance each agent's perceived value of the items they receive relative to other agents.

Here's a potential allocation using the valuations provided:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall preferences.
2. Identify high-value items for each agent and allocate them considering maximizing their utility while minimizing envy.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the highest.

To avoid conflict, we need to distribute the items considering different high-value preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 has the maximum value for this item).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (as Agent 2 values this item highly).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (as Agent 4 values this item highly).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 5 (a compromise for a relatively high value).
5. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (next best value after item 1 for Agent 0).
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (a reasonable value for Agent 3).
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (as a second item, since Agent 5 values it moderately).

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
