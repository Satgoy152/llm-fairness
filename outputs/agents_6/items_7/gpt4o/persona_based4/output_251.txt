Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  35   4  94  78  56   0
1  26   5   3  85  94  84  12
2  17  54   4  60  54   8  63
3  80  50   0  61  49  48  25
4  26  59  30  54  11  46  86
5   9  63  98   7  59  93  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly, and no agent envies another's allocation. Given the valuations provided, we can use a simple heuristic approach to assign items to agents based on their preferences.

Let's examine the values and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4. We'll assign item 0 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value for them.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 5. We'll assign item 4 to Agent 1 since it provides the highest value for them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 highly. We'll assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 highly but since it is already assigned, we'll assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 highly, but since it is already assigned, we'll assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 highly. We'll assign item 2 to Agent 5.

Now let's check for any remaining unallocated items. Item 1 is still unallocated:
- Agent 1 and Agent 5 both have relatively high values for item 1, but to maintain a balanced allocation, we'll assign item 1 to Agent 5 because they have fewer items so far.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 1]
}
```
