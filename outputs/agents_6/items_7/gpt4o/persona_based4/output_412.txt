Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  71  72  72  66  28  90
1  64  25  38  38  48  74  38
2  63  59   4  38  65  92   9
3  16  98  59  13  35  10  61
4  45  56  75  15  21  88  19
5  54  99  22  80  65  93   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation based on their own valuations. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the most (90). Let's allocate item 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: After item 6 is allocated, item 5 has the highest value (74) for agent 1. Let's allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: For agent 2, item 5 is already taken. The next highest value is item 4 (65), so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 the most (98), so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: For agent 4, item 2 is the most valued (75). Let's allocate item 2 to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 1 the most, but it's taken. The next highest value is item 3 (80), so we allocate item 3 to agent 5.

7. **Remaining Item**: The only remaining unallocated item is 0. Agent 0 values item 0 the most after item 6, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: Item [2]
- Agent 5: Item [3]

Now let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```
