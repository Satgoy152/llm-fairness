Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  26  16  93  32  21  28
1  72   0  63  12  51  18   6
2  43  10  32  49  54  40  59
3  65   9   6  68  22  29  50
4   0  16   1  64  16  46  91
5  56  75  26  60  23   7  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we aim for an envy-free allocation, meaning that each agent should not prefer the bundle of another agent to their own based on their valuations. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive one more item than the others.

Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences**: Start by identifying which items have particularly high valuations for certain agents and attempt to allocate those items to those agents.

2. **Assign Items**: Distribute the items to agents considering their preferences and try to ensure that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** has high values for items 0 and 3. We'll give them item 3.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 highly. We'll allocate item 2 to them.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 the most. We'll give them item 6.
- **Agent 3** has a higher valuation for item 0 compared to others. We'll allocate item 0 to them.
- **Agent 4** values item 4. We'll allocate item 4 to them.
- **Agent 5** values item 1 the most. We'll give them item 1.
- The remaining item 5 can be allocated to Agent 4 or Agent 5. We'll allocate it to Agent 4 to balance the number of items since Agent 4 has a lower total value from their initial allocation.

Here's how the allocation looks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items with at least one agent receiving more than one item to account for all 7 items.
