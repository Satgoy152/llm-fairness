Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  19   7  90  61  72  92
1  64   3   5  74   2  69  74
2  22  60  79  89  10  24  14
3  46  26  81  86  24  84  14
4  93   6  66  70  58  61  54
5  58  19  52  34  79  61   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64  3  5 74  2 69 74]
 [22 60 79 89 10 24 14]

 [93  6 66 70 58 61 54]
 [58 19 52 34 79 61  9]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or reducing envy among the agents. Our goal is to ensure that all agents feel they are getting a fair share without envying others for what they have received, as much as possible.

Given the preferences in the table, let's start by examining the highest value items for each agent and attempt to allocate based on where the respective items are valued most, while ensuring all 7 items are allocated:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (93).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (60).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (81).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (90).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 5 (79).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (72), but Agent 3 (84) values it higher.
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (92).

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item while trying to align with their highest valuations to reduce envy:

- Agent 0: Receives item 6 (value 92).
- Agent 1: Receives item 3 (value 74).
- Agent 2: Receives item 1 (value 60).
- Agent 3: Receives item 5 (value 84).
- Agent 4: Receives item 0 (value 93).
- Agent 5: Receives item 4 (value 79).

So far, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining item 2:

- Item 2: The next best valuation is by Agent 3 (81).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure each agent receives at least one item they highly value, minimizing potential envy.
