Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  10  15  48   0  94   2
1  21  88  91  95  87  90   4
2  67  67   6  97  89  87  25
3  24  51  79  45  72  70  39
4  96  88  38  70  37   8  36
5  85  53  58  82  73  24  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness as a guiding principle. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own. Given the valuation matrix, we will aim to distribute items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation minimizes potential envy.

First, we identify each agent's highest valued item and attempt to allocate it to them if no conflict arises. If a conflict does arise, we'll look for alternative allocations that maintain or improve envy-freeness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 5 with a valuation of 94.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 3 with a valuation of 95.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 3 with a valuation of 97, but since item 3 is already claimed, the next highest valued item is item 4 with a valuation of 89.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 2 with a valuation of 79.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 highly values item 0 with a valuation of 96.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 highly values item 0 with a valuation of 85, but since item 0 is already claimed, the next highest valued item is item 3 with a valuation of 82, which is already claimed. We then allocate item 1 with a valuation of 53.

Now we have:
- Item 6 is still unallocated. It is the next best option for Agent 3, who has a valuation of 39 for it.

Let's allocate the remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item and minimize envy:

- Agent 0: Items [5]
- Agent 1: Items [3]
- Agent 2: Items [4]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 4: Items [0]
- Agent 5: Items [1]

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. The allocation minimizes envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```
