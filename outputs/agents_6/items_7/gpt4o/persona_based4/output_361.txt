Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  47   8   0  57  43  19
1  33  56  74  45  15  50   4
2  45  75  70  91  43  61   7
3  73  35  33   7  43  88  52
4  41  25  73  71  97  30  74
5  48  33  68  44  55  60   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

Given the valuations, a possible strategy is to perform a round-robin allocation where each agent picks their most valued item from the remaining available items. This method can help mitigate envy among agents.

Let's go through the allocation process step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (57), so they pick item 4.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (74), so they pick item 2.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest (91), so they pick item 3.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest (88), so they pick item 5.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest, but it is already taken, so they pick item 6 instead (74).
6. **Agent 5** values item 5 the highest, but it is already taken, so they pick item 0 (48).

After the first round, we have the following allocations:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [0]

Now, we have 1 item left to allocate (item 1). We will review the remaining item and allocate it to the agent with the next highest valuation:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 at 47.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 at 56.
- **Agent 2** values item 1 at 75.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 at 35.
- **Agent 4** values item 1 at 25.
- **Agent 5** values item 1 at 33.

Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 75, so they pick item 1.

The final allocations are as follows:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```
