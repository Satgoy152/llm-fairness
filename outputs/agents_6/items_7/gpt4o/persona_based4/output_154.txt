Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  36  90  66  21  72  67
1   8  47  75  10  66  65  96
2  73  30  88  73  85  96  89
3  53  27  84  81  56  65  21
4  26  31  42  52  86  68  29
5  45  88  84  97  67  27  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and possibly achieves envy-freeness. Envy-freeness implies that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. However, given the constraints of an integer number of items per agent and the limited number of items, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible. Instead, we'll aim to find a reasonable fair allocation based on the given valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [13, 36, 90, 66, 21, 72, 67]
Agent 1: [8, 47, 75, 10, 66, 65, 96]
Agent 2: [73, 30, 88, 73, 85, 96, 89]
Agent 3: [53, 27, 84, 81, 56, 65, 21]
Agent 4: [26, 31, 42, 52, 86, 68, 29]
Agent 5: [45, 88, 84, 97, 67, 27, 71]
```

To achieve an allocation, we can use a greedy algorithm, starting by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item whenever possible, and making adjustments to balance the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it most at 73.
2. Item 1: Agent 5 values it most at 88.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it most at 90.
4. Item 3: Agent 5 values it most at 97.
5. Item 4: Agent 4 values it most at 86.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it second most at 96 (after Agent 2).
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it most at 96.

Now, let's make sure each agent has an item, and adjust if needed:

- Agent 5 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 currently has no items, so we need to adjust.

Since Agent 3 has no items and we need to ensure every agent gets something, let's consider redistributing:

To ensure agent 3 receives an item, we can adjust the allocation by moving item 5 from agent 2 to agent 3, as agent 3 values item 5 at 65, which is reasonable compared to other items. This leaves agent 2 with one item but still maintains a fairer distribution across agents.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
