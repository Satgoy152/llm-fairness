Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  98   5  14  53  97  83
1  40  84  14  91  57  29  34
2  89  20  88  49  14  51  97
3  45  64  53  89  88  75  24
4  32   0  74  56  29  53  93
5  94  68  31  85  49   4  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that aims for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy among agents. One approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin or bidding approach where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool.

Let's proceed with this approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (98).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (91).
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (97).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most, but it’s already taken, so next best is item 4 (88).
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 the most, but it’s already taken, so next best is item 6 (93).
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 the most (94).

Now, for the remaining items, we need to continue the process where each agent picks their next highest valued item from the remaining items:

7. **Agent 0**’s next highest is item 0 (84), but it’s taken, next is item 5 (97).
8. **Agent 1**’s next highest is item 5 (29), but it’s taken, next is item 0 (40).
9. **Agent 2**’s next highest is item 2 (88).
10. **Agent 3** already has one item, and since there are only 7 items and 6 agents, not all agents will have two items.
11. **Agent 4** already has one item.
12. **Agent 5**’s next highest is item 1 (68), but it’s taken, next is item 3 (85).

After this process, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: [3, 0]
- Agent 2: [6, 2]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: []

However, this needs to be adjusted because not all items are unique, and some allocations overlap. Let's correct this:

1. **Agent 0** gets item 1 (98), then item 5 (97).
2. **Agent 1** gets item 3 (91).
3. **Agent 2** gets item 6 (97).
4. **Agent 3** gets item 4 (88).
5. **Agent 4** gets item 2 (74).
6. **Agent 5** gets item 0 (94).

Each agent gets one item except for one agent who gets zero because there are 6 agents and 7 items.

Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```
