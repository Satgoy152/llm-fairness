Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  53  60  94  30   9  99
1  39  24  45  66  90  41  50
2  20  44  10  60  41  96  93
3   5  69  99  50   3  22  41
4  11  40  68  67  94  73  81
5  40  90  19  40  17  79  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the envy-free fair division principle. In this context, an allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. One simple approach to achieve this is by iterating over the agents and assigning each agent the item that they value the most among the remaining unallocated items. 

We have 6 agents and 7 items, which means one agent will receive 2 items and the rest will receive 1 item each. Let's try to allocate the items as follows:

1. Calculate the highest valued item for each agent and allocate it.
2. Once each agent has received one item, allocate the remaining item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't received two items yet.

Let's walk through this allocation:

1. For Agent 0, the highest value is item 6 (value 99).
2. For Agent 1, the highest value is item 4 (value 90).
3. For Agent 2, the highest value is item 5 (value 96).
4. For Agent 3, the highest value is item 2 (value 99).
5. For Agent 4, the highest value is item 4 (value 94), but item 4 is already taken, so the next highest is item 6 (value 81), which is also taken, so we move to item 5 (value 73), which is also taken, hence item 0 (value 11) is allocated.
6. For Agent 5, the highest value is item 1 (value 90).

Now, all agents except one have one item. The remaining item 3 is not yet allocated. The agent who values item 3 the most among those who have received only one item gets it.

- Agent 0 already has item 6.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for the remaining item 3 (value 66).

Thus, Agent 1 receives item 3 in addition to item 4.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
