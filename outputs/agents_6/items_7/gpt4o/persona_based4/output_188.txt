Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74   5  20  18   2  58  80
1  46  95  48  26  17  96  97
2  68  84  73  70  40   6  30
3  37  84  52  13  68  83  60
4  42  91  25  99  54  96  20
5  42  56  61  56   9  68  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which balances the product of utilities for each agent. However, given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in all scenarios with integer allocations, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations and as close to envy-freeness as possible.

First, let's compute the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 74 + 5 + 20 + 18 + 2 + 58 + 80 = 257
- Agent 1: 46 + 95 + 48 + 26 + 17 + 96 + 97 = 425
- Agent 2: 68 + 84 + 73 + 70 + 40 + 6 + 30 = 371
- Agent 3: 37 + 84 + 52 + 13 + 68 + 83 + 60 = 397
- Agent 4: 42 + 91 + 25 + 99 + 54 + 96 + 20 = 427
- Agent 5: 42 + 56 + 61 + 56 + 9 + 68 + 26 = 318

Next, we aim to allocate the items so that the distribution reflects these valuations as fairly as possible, considering both the total valuation and the specific preferences for individual items.

A proposed allocation could be:

- Agent 0 (257 total valuation): Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1 (425 total valuation): Item [6]
- Agent 2 (371 total valuation): Items [1]
- Agent 3 (397 total valuation): Item [5]
- Agent 4 (427 total valuation): Items [4]
- Agent 5 (318 total valuation): Items [2]

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items according to preferences and total valuations. Now let's provide the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.
