Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  53  13  26  38  76  84
1  80  12  32  85  15  71  88
2  85  92  65   1  97  30  19
3  27  66  85  49  73  58  42
4  32  63   2  83  93   0  82
5   0  16  28  71  95  30  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to distribute the 7 items among the 6 agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible. Fair division in this context means minimizing envy among agents, where envy arises if one agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We'll aim for an allocation that considers each agent's valuation of the items.

One common approach is to maximize the sum of each agent's minimum satisfaction (also known as the "leximin" approach), or we can try to ensure that the allocation is envy-free if possible. Given the constraints of integer allocations and the number of items, we need to be strategic in how we distribute items.

Let's consider the agents' preferences and try to make an allocation that balances these preferences as much as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 0 and item 6. 
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 and item 3.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 and item 1.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 and item 4.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 and item 3.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 4 and item 6.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0** is allocated to Agent 0, who values it the highest.
- **Item 1** is allocated to Agent 2, who values it the highest.
- **Item 2** is allocated to Agent 3, who values it the highest.
- **Item 3** is allocated to Agent 1, who values it the highest.
- **Item 4** is allocated to Agent 4, who values it the highest.
- **Item 5** is allocated to Agent 0, who has a high remaining preference for it.
- **Item 6** is allocated to Agent 5, who shares a high valuation but hasn't received any item yet.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the strong preferences of each agent while ensuring every item is allocated exactly once. Each agent receives at least one item, minimizing potential envy given the high-value items they receive.
