Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  58  77  16  57  68  66
1  14  22  45  41   0  91  32
2  54  49  51  66  99  18  61
3  58  52  34  77  58  88  70
4  23  58  62  61  76  49  96
5  29  28  91  83  28  58  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction is balanced. Given there are 6 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive one item, and others will receive two. We'll aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than their own.

Here is one possible allocation strategy considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Has relatively high valuations for items 2 and 5. Let's assign item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** Values item 5 highly, but it's already allocated. Instead, we can give Agent 1 item 2.

3. **Agent 2:** Highly values item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** Values item 3 highly. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuation is for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuation is 91 for item 2, which is already allocated, but item 3 is also highly valued. Since item 3 is allocated, we'll assign item 0 to Agent 5.

Now we have assigned one item to each agent, leaving item 1 unallocated. We will assign the remaining item to ensure balance in total valuations.

- **Item 1** has relatively high value for Agents 0, 3, and 4.
- To balance the allocations and maximize overall satisfaction, we will assign item 1 to Agent 3, who can benefit from it significantly.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance each agent's satisfaction with their respective valuations and minimize envy.
