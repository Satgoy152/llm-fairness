Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  44  51  16  37  28  57
1  76  26  41  81  25  77  63
2  80  29  29  44  90  86  54
3  28  75  33  89  10  12  38
4  19  96  38  94  43  86  29
5  19  97  40  58  23  71  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division and minimize envy among the agents, we can use various fair division algorithms, such as the envy-free method. However, given the constraints of allocating exactly 7 items among 6 agents, we aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible in terms of perceived value by each agent.

The goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's attempt to allocate the items in a manner that maximizes each agent's total value of allocated items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **List each agent's highest-valued item**: Start by identifying the item that each agent values the most. This can guide initial allocations.
   
2. **Initial allocations based on highest values**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (63).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (81).
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (90).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (89), but since it’s taken, the next is item 1 (75).
   - Agent 4 values item 1 the most (96), but since it’s taken, the next is item 3 (94), but since it's taken, the next is item 5 (86).
   - Agent 5 values item 1 the most (97), but since it’s taken, the next is item 5 (71), but since it's taken, the next is item 2 (40).

3. **Resolve conflicts and finalize allocations**: If multiple agents value the same item the most, assign it to the agent who values it more or whose alternative options are less favorable. Then, proceed to allocate remaining items to balance the distribution.

Following this process, here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: Item [5]
- Agent 5: Item [2]

This allocation attempts to distribute items such that each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items when possible, achieving a balance across the valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
