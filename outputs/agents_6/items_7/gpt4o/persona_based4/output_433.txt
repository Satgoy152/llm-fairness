Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  68  13  25  49  11  53
1  90  10  30  96  10  30  53
2  65  59  36   7  11  13  72
3  16   3  77  98  58  53  13
4  60  77  87  83  81  30   2
5  82  73  20  13  42  49  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives through the allocation. The goal is to ensure that no agent prefers the allocation of another, thereby minimizing envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 0 (90) and 1 (68).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 0 (90) and 3 (96).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Has a high valuation for item 6 (72).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 3 (98) and 2 (77).

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 2 (87) and 4 (81).

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Has relatively high valuations for items 0 (82) and 1 (73).

**Allocation Strategy:**

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their highest value.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it is their highest value.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as it is their highest value.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 5, as it is one of their highest values and Agent 1 already got item 3.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest value.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as it is available and they have a moderate valuation for it.

This allocation tries to maximize the utility for each agent while considering their preferences and keeping envy to a minimum.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are relatively valuable to them while ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents.
