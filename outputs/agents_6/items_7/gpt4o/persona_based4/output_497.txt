Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  99  78  14  28  45  97
1  37  54  79  62  44  57  95
2  58  25  42  65  38  41   5
3  75  10  81  54  25  87  63
4   9  67  57  90  81  81  73
5  84  50  83  40  95  12  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we should aim for each agent to receive items such that they feel they are getting a fair share based on their valuations. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive an extra item. 

We will attempt to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring no single agent dominates the allocation excessively. Here's one possible approach:

1. List each agent's highest valued item to start the allocation process.
2. Allocate items iteratively while considering the next highest valued items for each agent.
3. Ensure that one agent gets an extra item in a way that minimally disrupts the perceived fairness.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (99).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (95).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (65).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most (87).
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the most (90) but it's taken, so item 4 (81).
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the most (95) but it's taken, so item 0 (84).

Continuing to allocate remaining items:

- Since most agents have their highest or second highest valued items, the remaining items (2, 6) can be allocated to minimize envy.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [0, 2] (Agent 5 gets two items as they benefit less from their highest valued item being taken)

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```
