Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  66  83  78  43  54  71
1  99  78  94  73  18  48  17
2  13  99   0  23  78  89  73
3  44  93  77  33  89  21  14
4  54  28  26  33  71  57  32
5  10  50  73   3  69  96  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This approach maximizes the product of the utilities (or valuations) each agent receives from their allocated items. We will consider each agent's valuation of each item and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes this product.

Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Let's proceed with the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Values items 2 and 3 highly (83 and 78 respectively).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 very highly (99).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 1 highly (99).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 4 highly (89).
- **Agent 4**: Has moderate values across items, but none very high.
- **Agent 5**: Values item 5 highly (96).

A possible allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy is:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 4.
- Agent 4 receives item 6.
- Agent 5 receives item 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fair share relative to their valuations, with a focus on reducing potential envy among the agents.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```
