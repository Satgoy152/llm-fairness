Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  55  13   2  51  24  76
1  76  20  25  97  48  85  82
2  20  10  88  79  50  78  99
3  79   0  57  16  91  56  60
4  10  87  54  58  19  78  74
5  11  80  18  90  27  26  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will consider an envy-free approach where each agent receives items such that their perceived value is maximized while attempting to minimize envy between agents. Given that there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one item each.

To achieve this, we can use a method that tries to assign each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will then adjust the allocation to ensure that one agent receives two items.

### Initial Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Best valued by Agent 0 with a value of 94.
2. **Item 1**: Best valued by Agent 4 with a value of 87.
3. **Item 2**: Best valued by Agent 2 with a value of 88.
4. **Item 3**: Best valued by Agent 1 with a value of 97.
5. **Item 4**: Best valued by Agent 3 with a value of 91.
6. **Item 5**: Best valued by Agent 1 with a value of 85.
7. **Item 6**: Best valued by Agent 2 with a value of 99.

### Balancing the Allocation:

Given the above initial allocation, we can see that Agent 1 and Agent 2 have been assigned two items. We will have to select one of them to receive only one item to ensure all agents get an item. Letâ€™s adjust by re-allocating item 5 to another agent:

- Agent 1: Items 3 (97) and 5 (85). Remove item 5.
- Agent 2: Items 2 (88) and 6 (99).

Reallocate item 5 to Agent 5, who values it at 26 (next highest among unallocated agents).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize their individual valuations in an envy-free manner.
