Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  72  39  32  83  50  25
1  39  64   4  51  23  60  18
2  15  80   2  64  36  94  68
3  94  17  38  47  11  35  60
4  48  39  13   5  95  13  32
5  73  40  91   2  31   5   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Since there are 6 agents and 7 items, we can allocate 1 item to each of 5 agents and 2 items to one agent.

Here's one potential allocation that considers the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (83).
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (60).
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest (94), but since item 5 is assigned to Agent 1, we can assign Agent 2 their next highest valued item, which is item 1 (80).
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest (94).
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest (95), but since item 4 is assigned to Agent 0, we can assign Agent 4 their next highest valued item, which is item 0 (48).
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 the highest (91).

To ensure all items are allocated without any overlap:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 5.

This allocation attempts to balance the high valuations across different agents while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```
