Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  91   0  18  28  19  29
1  44   4  32  68  59  94  55
2  95  38  90  64  76  24  51
3  93  90   6  53  48  34   8
4  13  55  10  92  17  51  30
5  23  36  64  30  25  73  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible. We will use the concept of envy-freeness as a guideline, which means that each agent should ideally prefer their own allocation over any other agent's allocation.

A common approach in such problems is to use an algorithm like the Round Robin or Maximum Nash Welfare, but given the small size, we can manually inspect and allocate items to find a fair solution.

Let's first consider the highest valuations by each agent for the items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 91.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 94.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 95.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 93.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest at 92.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest at 73.

Now, let's attempt to allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring fairness and minimizing envy:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 and should receive it.
2. **Agent 0** has the second-highest valuation for item 1 and should receive it.
3. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 3 and should receive it.
4. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 and should receive it.
5. **Agent 3** values item 2 next and should receive it.
6. **Agent 5** can receive item 4, which is one of the remaining high-valued items for them.
7. The last item, item 6, can be allocated to the agent with the least total value so far to balance the allocation. Given the allocations, it can go to **Agent 5** to balance their allocation value with that of the others.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
