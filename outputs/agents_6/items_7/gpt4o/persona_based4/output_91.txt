Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  83   5  82  60  79  11
1  94  90  59  30  24  81  15
2  77  92  50  76  54  38  63
3  85  93  45  53  19  28  79
4  22  65   1  96  42  73  99
5  35  93  18  48  95  38  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use various algorithms or approaches, such as the adjusted winner procedure, the envy-free cake-cutting algorithm, or the max-min fair allocation. However, given the constraints of integer allocation and the need for practicality, we can approach this through a manual inspection of the valuation matrix to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 1 (83) and item 3 (82). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 0 (94). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 2 (50) and item 5 (38) compared to others. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 6 (79) and item 1 (93), but item 6 is not yet allocated. Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 3 (96). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highly values item 4 (95) and item 1 (93), but item 4 is not yet allocated. Assign item 4 to Agent 5.

Now, let's see if we can allocate the remaining item, item 2, to minimize envy. Item 2 has relatively low values for most agents, but Agent 2 values it higher than Agent 5 does. We can assign item 2 to Agent 2, which gives Agent 2 a higher combined valuation without significantly increasing envy.

The final allocation is:

- **Agent 0**: [1]
- **Agent 1**: [0]
- **Agent 2**: [2, 5]
- **Agent 3**: [6]
- **Agent 4**: [3]
- **Agent 5**: [4]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning each agent at least one item that they value relatively highly, considering the constraints.
