Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  35  33  97  33  95  30
1  33  68  72  85  13  62  26
2  50  12  15   2  54  41  60
3  45  88  56  54  30   7  77
4  58  17  60  13  64  28  10
5  72  32   2  45   3  35   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we must ensure that each agent perceives their bundle as at least as good as anyone else's, based on their valuations. Given the constraints that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, we can proceed with a reasonable division by evaluating the valuations of the items for each agent.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are higher for items 3 and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the highest.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 the highest.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 0 the highest.

Based on these valuations, an allocation that minimizes envy could be:

- Agent 0 is given items: 3, 5
- Agent 1 is given item: 2
- Agent 2 is given item: 6
- Agent 3 is given item: 1
- Agent 4 is given item: 4
- Agent 5 is given item: 0

This allocation gives each agent an item they value highly, attempting to balance the perceived fairness of the distribution.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```
