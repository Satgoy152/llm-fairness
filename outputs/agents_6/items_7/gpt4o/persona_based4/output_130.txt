Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27   1  73  27  18   6  92
1  48  25  52  49  97  51  47
2  22  17  39  81  69  32  90
3  90  92  41  72   3  88  97
4   9  26  46  94  70  92  61
5  71  62  31  94  79  67  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve a division that minimizes envy among the agents. Given that we have 6 agents and 7 items, each agent can get at least one item, but distributing them in a way that balances the agents' perceived values is tricky. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuation Items:** Determine items with high valuations across agents and try to allocate them to agents who value them the most, provided this doesn't create significant envy.

2. **Assign Based on Maximum Valuation:** Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the highest while ensuring that other agents are not left with unacceptably low value items.

3. **Balance Remaining Items:** After the high-value items are assigned, balance the remaining items to ensure each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Based on this strategy, let's perform the allocations:

- **Item 0:** Agent 3 values this item the highest at 90.
- **Item 1:** Agent 3 also values this item the highest at 92.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this item the highest at 73.
- **Item 3:** Both Agents 4 and 5 value this item at 94, but Agent 4 has fewer high-value options, so we assign it to Agent 4.
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values this item the highest at 97.
- **Item 5:** Agent 4 values this item the highest at 92, but since Agent 4 already has item 3, we'll check others. Agent 5, with a good valuation of 67, can take it.
- **Item 6:** Agent 3 values this item the highest at 97, but to avoid concentration, we give it to Agent 2, who also has a high valuation of 90.

Now, each agent is checked for envy and valuation balance:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 3.
- Agent 5 gets item 5.

Here is the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations while ensuring all agents receive at least one item.
