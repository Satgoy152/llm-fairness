Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  63  65  63  84   4  91
1  87  41  34  95  56  26  93
2  53  40  92  16  72  33  46
3  54   7  45  53  16  22  44
4  78   4  39  40  24  69  81
5  13  64  85  72  51  13  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ the envy-free criterion, which seeks to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints, we aim to allocate each of the 7 items to the 6 agents such that the allocations are fair based on the provided valuations.

One approach to make this allocation is to use a round-robin method, where each agent in sequence selects their most valued remaining item. This method often produces an envy-free result when agents have distinct preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value = Item 6 (91)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value = Item 3 (95)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value = Item 2 (92)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value = Item 0 (54)
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value = Item 6, but it's taken. Next highest = Item 0 (78)
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value = Item 2, but it's taken. Next highest = Item 1 (64)

Now, repeat the selection among remaining items:

- Remaining items: 4, 5
- **Agent 0**: Highest value = Item 4 (84)
- **Agent 1**: Highest value = Item 6, but it's taken. Next highest = Item 0 (87)
- **Agent 2**: Highest value = Item 4, but it's taken. Next highest = Item 0 (53)
- **Agent 3**: Highest value = Item 2, but it's taken. Next highest = Item 0 (54)
- **Agent 4**: Highest value = Item 2, but it's taken. Next highest = Item 6 (81)
- **Agent 5**: Highest value = Item 4, but it's taken. Next highest = Item 0 (13)

Final allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [6, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Item [3]
- **Agent 2**: Item [2]
- **Agent 3**: Item [0]
- **Agent 4**: No items left for allocation with higher preference
- **Agent 5**: Item [1]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the process attempts to minimize envy based on the preferences. Here's the JSON formatted allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1]
}
```
