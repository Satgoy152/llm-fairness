Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61   4   6  92  10  99  17
1  69  53  19  36   1  58  81
2  86  46  68  21  68  77  13
3  30   5  80  78  73  13  78
4  59  87  45  84  45  89  16
5  81  14  36  57  82  20  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among agents, we aim to achieve a division where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations, ideally minimizing envy. Considering there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one.

Here is one potential allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocate items where Agent 0 has relatively high value compared to others.
   - Assign item 5 (value 99).

2. **Agent 1:** Allocate items which maximize Agent 1's valuation.
   - Assign item 0 (value 69).

3. **Agent 2:** Allocate items where Agent 2 has relatively high value compared to others.
   - Assign item 2 (value 68).

4. **Agent 3:** Allocate items where Agent 3 has relatively high value compared to others.
   - Assign item 3 (value 78).

5. **Agent 4:** Allocate items where Agent 4 has relatively high value compared to others.
   - Assign item 1 (value 87).

6. **Agent 5:** Allocate items where Agent 5 has relatively high value compared to others.
   - Assign items 4 (value 82) and 6 (value 78).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and one agent receives an extra item to ensure all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4, 6]
}
```
