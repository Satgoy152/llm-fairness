Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  53  95  25  86   1  52
1  82  15  77  35  10  90  72
2  33  25   0  20  69   5  54
3  41  84  17  16  56  85  25
4   1  61  17  15  90   6  79
5  78  40  89  88  24  40  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items to the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a combination of items that maximizes their utility given the constraints. The goal is to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given the valuation matrix.

The table of valuations is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  53  95  25  86   1  52
1  82  15  77  35  10  90  72
2  33  25   0  20  69   5  54
3  41  84  17  16  56  85  25
4   1  61  17  15  90   6  79
5  78  40  89  88  24  40  46
```

The allocation strategy involves analyzing the valuations and distributing the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction and minimizes envy:

1. **Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations**: This helps ensure that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.
2. **Ensure integer allocation**: Each agent can be assigned an integer number of items.
3. **Distribute all items**: All 7 items must be allocated.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most.

Now, let's check if any items cause conflicts and resolve them by considering second-highest preferences:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 has a high valuation for it and it avoids conflicts.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 based on a high valuation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 based on a high valuation.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 5.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent gets an item that they highly value while minimizing envy among the agents.
