Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  57  53  12  26  20  76
1  49  85  16  16  37  80   4
2  95  16  42   6  38  52  30
3  50   8  76  94  33  39  63
4  25  35  29  97  41  69  53
5  94  29  99  11  92  38  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent has a better allocation based on their own valuations. In this scenario, we can attempt a simple allocation strategy that ensures each agent receives a high-value item based on their own preferences.

Let's analyze the given valuations and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 highly at 76.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly at 85.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 highly at 95.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly at 94.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 highly at 97.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 2 highly at 99.

Now, let's try to allocate these items by maximizing each agent's individual valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (although Agent 3 values item 3 highest, it will be allocated to Agent 4 to maximize combined satisfaction).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 4 (as it is the highest for Agent 4).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 5.

Now, we have one item, 5, left unallocated. Let's choose a fair distribution for the remaining item:

- Agent 3 has the next highest valuation for item 5 at 39.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the highest individual valuations to reduce envy among the agents. Here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```
