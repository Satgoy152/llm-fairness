Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  59  62   8  22  43  13
1  95  23  61  14  50   4  24
2  64  96  33  49  78  88  38
3  33  96  23  12  47  38  56
4  56  89  32  82  93  30  41
5  83  11  93  50  70  38  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each.

To determine the allocation, we can employ a strategy such as maximizing the minimum value received by each agent or using a round-robin selection based on the highest valuations. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 2 (highest value for Agent 0 is 62)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 0 (highest value for Agent 1 is 95)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (highest value for Agent 2 is 96)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 6 (highest value for Agent 3 is 56)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 4 (highest value for Agent 4 is 93)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 3 and Item 5 (highest values for Agent 5 are 93 and 70, but since item 2 is taken, next are 38 and 50)

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives at least one of their highest-valued items, while Agent 5, receiving two items, gets a combination close to their highest total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that only 7 items are allocated in total, with each agent receiving items according to their preferences as much as possible given the constraint of integer allocations.
