Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  10  91  45  29  52  23
1  12  25  82  15  59  79  84
2   0  62  55  16  97  99  74
3  72  73  91  90  78  85   7
4  83  32  65  63  54  81  19
5   0  30  75  49  84  72   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels their allocation is as fair as possible, trying to minimize envy. We will consider the valuations of each agent for the items and attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's consider the problem and make an allocation attempt:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 highly (99). Allocating item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 highly (84). Allocating item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highly (99). Allocating item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 and 3 highly, but item 2 has a higher value (91). Allocating item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 highly, but it is already allocated, so we allocate item 5, but it is already allocated, so we allocate item 4 (54) to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 4 highly (84). Allocating item 4 to agent 5.

Now we have allocated items 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Items 1 and 3 are yet to be allocated.

- **Agent 0** already has item 0, but no agent has a high preference for item 1. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 to balance.
- **Agent 1** has item 6, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1, which is the last unallocated item.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4]
}
```

Every item is allocated, and each agent has been considered for their preferences to the best extent possible, given the constraints.
