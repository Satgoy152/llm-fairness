Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36   4  56  28  96  39  56
1  34  19  77  13  38  22  65
2  86  10  87  46  28  40  88
3  36  20  71  50  31  84  50
4  56  10  41  21  15  13   5
5  95  14  12  47  30  25  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we must ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent. However, since we're dealing with integer allocations and a limited number of items, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible. Instead, we'll aim for a reasonable distribution based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. We'll also try to minimize envy by considering the highest valued items for each agent.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued item is 4 (value 96).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued item is 2 (value 77).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued item is 6 (value 88).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued item is 5 (value 84).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valued item is 0 (value 56).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valued item is 0 (value 95).

Given the above preferences, let's allocate items to maximize individual satisfaction while covering all items:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 5. (Agent 4's second preference is item 0, but Agent 5 values it more.)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (next highest value after item 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has item 4, which is highly valued, we add another item to balance allocations).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and we have allocated exactly 7 items in total.
