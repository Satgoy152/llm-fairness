Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  42  61  66  40  10  57
1  69  34  66  55  68  94  22
2  67  78  59  39  81  52  86
3  15  30  69  64  17   4  45
4  28   8  18  60  38   6  68
5  61  31  95  41  80  60  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll consider each agent's preferences and attempt to distribute items such that no agent envies another's allocation. We'll use a heuristic approach to balance the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [2, 42, 61, 66, 40, 10, 57]
- Agent 1: [69, 34, 66, 55, 68, 94, 22]
- Agent 2: [67, 78, 59, 39, 81, 52, 86]
- Agent 3: [15, 30, 69, 64, 17, 4, 45]
- Agent 4: [28, 8, 18, 60, 38, 6, 68]
- Agent 5: [61, 31, 95, 41, 80, 60, 23]

We aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their highest valued items and ensuring that the total allocation is balanced.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 will get items that they value moderately but are not the highest valued by others: Items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 will receive high-value items that are not highly valued by others: Items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 will get items of high personal value: Items 4 and 1.
- Agent 3 will receive item 3, which is of moderate value to them and not the highest valued by others.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [4, 1]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: []

Let's ensure that all 7 items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items. This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to distribute items fairly across agents. Not all agents receive items, but those who do get items that are relatively higher in their preference list, reducing overall envy.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```
