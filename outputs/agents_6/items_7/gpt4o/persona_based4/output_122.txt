Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  22  10  29  44  42  31
1  65  84  84  17  29  77  85
2   0  91  80  76  33  96  92
3  67  62  76  12   5   7  93
4   6  77  61  36  28  53  83
5  80  71  26  54  95  70  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we will employ the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations, we'll try to allocate items in such a way that minimizes envy among the agents. Here's one approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation on item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation on item 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation on item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation on item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation on item 1.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation on item 4.

We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 values item 0 the most, assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 6 to agent 1 based on highest value.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 to agent 2 based on highest value.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 to agent 3 based on their highest value.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 1 to agent 4 based on their highest value.
6. **Agent 5**: Assign item 4 to agent 5 based on their highest value.

Remaining item:

- **Item 2**: This item can be allocated to the agent who values it the most without causing substantial envy issues. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2 as well, so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.

Summarizing the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item [0]
- Agent 1: Items [6, 2]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Item [3]
- Agent 4: Item [1]
- Agent 5: Item [4]

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4]
}
```
