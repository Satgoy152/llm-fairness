Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  53   9  95  64   3  78
1  90  62  55   4  61  31   0
2  18  65   3  34  25  55  77
3  74  30  54  24  53  35  27
4  89  53  54  53  60  41  24
5   3  35  63  21  34  71  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while maintaining a sense of fairness and avoiding envy, as much as possible. Given the constraints, we'll use a simple allocation method focusing on maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations.

First, let's look at the highest values each agent has for any item and consider allocating items based on these preferences, while ensuring each item is only given to one agent.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high value for item 3 (95). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 0 (90). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 6 (77). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 0 (74) but it's already taken, next highest is item 2 (54). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 0 (89) but it's already taken, next highest is item 4 (60). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value for item 5 (71). Assign item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item 1. Let's look for the agent who would benefit the most from it without causing envy:

- **Agent 0**: Valuation 53
- **Agent 1**: Valuation 62
- **Agent 2**: Valuation 65
- **Agent 3**: Valuation 30
- **Agent 4**: Valuation 53
- **Agent 5**: Valuation 35

Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1, and since Agent 2 has only one item so far, it makes sense to allocate it to them.

Here is the fair allocation based on this reasoning:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
