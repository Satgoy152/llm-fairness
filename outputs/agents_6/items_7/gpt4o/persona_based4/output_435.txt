Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17   0  66  90  90  76  73
1  29  69  77  66  94  17  92
2  43  24  31  70  99  46  63
3  81  40  65  49  75  38  73
4  27  53  14  97  21  28  39
5   2  41   7  83  97   7  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of achieving envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. This makes sure that each agent feels fairly treated to the extent possible given their valuations. One approach is to use an iterative method to assign items, ensuring that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation to their own. Let's proceed with that method.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate items based on the highest valuation where possible, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are assigned and no agent excessively envies another.

Based on the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest.
- Agent 5 values item 4 the highest.

After careful consideration to balance the allocations, here is a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [3]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [0]
- Agent 4: Items [1]
- Agent 5: Items [2, 5]

This allocation attempts to evenly distribute items based on the highest utility each agent derives from the items, while respecting the overall constraint of assigning exactly 7 items.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```
