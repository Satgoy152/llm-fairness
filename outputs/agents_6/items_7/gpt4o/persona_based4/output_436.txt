Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14   5  30  62  51  66  70
1   8  52  91  62  22  44  99
2  12  26  81  99  29  87  30
3  69  45  24  73  74  47  37
4  65  59   2  55  69  74   3
5  36  89  23  68  88  57  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that considers envy-freeness and tries to distribute the items such that no agent has a reason to envy another based on their valuation of the allocated items. This suggests considering each agent's preferences and attempting to balance the total value each agent receives to the extent possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Prefers item 6 (value 70), item 5 (value 66)
- Agent 1: Prefers item 6 (value 99), item 2 (value 91)
- Agent 2: Prefers item 3 (value 99), item 5 (value 87)
- Agent 3: Prefers item 4 (value 74), item 3 (value 73)
- Agent 4: Prefers item 5 (value 74), item 4 (value 69)
- Agent 5: Prefers item 1 (value 89), item 4 (value 88)

Considering these preferences and trying to allocate items to reduce potential envy:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2)
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (highest value for Agent 4)
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 5 (highest value for Agent 5)
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3)
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest preference for Agent 0)
7. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (remaining item, with reasonable value for Agent 0)

This allocation attempts to balance the values received by each agent, minimizing potential envy according to their preferences.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
