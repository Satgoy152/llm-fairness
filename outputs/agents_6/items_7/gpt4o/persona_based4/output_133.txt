Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  73  97  44  61  76  45
1  87  73   4  63  34  30  36
2  90  35  34   0  47  24  76
3  38  54  55   7  45  28   9
4   0  73  10  62  44  32  36
5   8  18  93  39  33   2  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's bundle of items over their own, based on their valuations. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, at least one agent will receive 2 items, while others will receive 1 or none.

Here's a possible allocation that tries to balance the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (97) and item 0 (90). Allocating these two items will maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 (87) the most, but it's already allocated. The next best is item 3 (63), which is unallocated.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6 (76).
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 (55) highly, but it's taken. Item 1 (54) is the next best.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 (73) the most. However, it's taken, and item 3 (62) is the next best.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 2 (93), which is taken, so the next best is item 0 (8), but it's taken. Item 4 (33) is unallocated and the highest among available items.

With the above considerations, here's an allocation of items:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [6]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: Item [5]
- Agent 5: Item [4]

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest available valuations. It also ensures that all 7 items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```
