Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  95  72  29  26  31  96
1  53  13  48  79  27  25  24
2  16  40  45  67  29  87  71
3  38  79  46  89  28  33  96
4  41  20  25  90  17  56  55
5  70  66  72  14  51  71  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, we need to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. One possible approach is to use a round-robin method, wherein each agent gets a chance to pick an item based on their highest valuation. This approach will provide a reasonable distribution of items based on the agents' preferences.

Let's start by assigning items to agents:

1. **Agent 0** values items as follows: [81, 95, 72, 29, 26, 31, 96]. They value item 6 the highest.
2. **Agent 1** values items as follows: [53, 13, 48, 79, 27, 25, 24]. They value item 3 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values items as follows: [16, 40, 45, 67, 29, 87, 71]. They value item 5 the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values items as follows: [38, 79, 46, 89, 28, 33, 96]. They value item 6 the highest (already taken by Agent 0), so their next highest is item 3 (already taken by Agent 1), followed by item 1.
5. **Agent 4** values items as follows: [41, 20, 25, 90, 17, 56, 55]. They value item 3 the highest (already taken by Agent 1), so their next highest is item 4.
6. **Agent 5** values items as follows: [70, 66, 72, 14, 51, 71, 28]. They value item 2 the highest.

Considering the above, we'll allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 2.

This leaves item 0 unallocated. Since item 0 is highly valued by Agent 0, we will allocate it to them.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item they value highly.
