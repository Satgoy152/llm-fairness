Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  34  90  67  22  69  68
1  28  95  77   2  88  13  83
2  92  53  54  69  79  25  33
3  33  98  40  52   7  32   4
4  95  97  85  39   3   4  65
5  31  10  91  33  45  14   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the 6 agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, ensuring that each agent receives an allocation that they perceive as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. This is a complex problem and perfect envy-freeness might not always be achievable, especially given the constraints of integer allocations and a fixed number of items.

Let's proceed with a simple allocation approach that tries to maximize individual satisfaction based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 2 the most (value 90).
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 1 the most (value 95).
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 0 the most (value 92).
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 1 the most (value 98). However, since item 1 is taken, let's consider the next best, item 3 (value 52).
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 1 the most (value 97). However, since item 1 is taken, let's consider the next best, item 0 (value 95). But since item 0 is taken, let's consider the next best, item 2 (value 85).
6. **Agent 5:** Values item 2 the most (value 91). However, since item 2 is taken, let's consider the next best, item 4 (value 45).

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated fairly among these agents:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 5.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4 or Agent 5, depending on the fairness criteria.

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on the highest individual valuations while ensuring no agent is overly envious of another's allocation. Let's represent this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures every item is assigned to exactly one agent.
