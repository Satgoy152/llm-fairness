Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  32   2  37  31  38  98
1  30  78  62  45  11  77  33
2  81  35  17  51  44  97  79
3  33  37  86  57  28  91  74
4  57  32  61  70  32  55  52
5  25   7  26   7  93  86  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can utilize concepts from fair division, such as envy-freeness and maximizing overall satisfaction. The challenge is to balance the distribution so that no agent feels envious of another's allocation, given their own valuations.

To approach this, we can use a method such as the "maximin" or "envy-free" method. Here is a step-by-step outline of the strategy:

1. **Initial Observations**: Each agent has different valuations for each item, and we aim to distribute the total 7 items available to them such that envy is minimized.

2. **Total Valuation per Agent**: Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items. This will help in understanding which agents have higher preferences overall.

3. **Iterative Allocation**: Begin by allocating items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that the distribution remains balanced and fair.

4. **Checking for Envy**: After an initial allocation, check if any agent envies another agent's allocation. Adjust if necessary to reduce or eliminate envy.

5. **Final Allocation**: Ensure all items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items. It's important that the allocation is fair based on the agents' valuations.

After performing these calculations, here's a proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their item valuations, while ensuring all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
