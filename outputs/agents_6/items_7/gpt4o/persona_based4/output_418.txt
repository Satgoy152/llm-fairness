Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37   2  77  35  27   1  73
1  34  60  26   1  91  15   9
2  71  62  44  59  37  95  21
3  20  32  67  90   1  26  35
4  65  46   7   0  16  67  17
5  98  34   4  66  97  58  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. Our goal is to allocate the items in such a way that no agent envies another's allocation. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent’s allocation in terms of their own valuations.

A good strategy in this context is to use the Envy-Free up-to-One Item (EF1) criteria, which ensures that any envy an agent might have can be eliminated by removing at most one item from another agent's allocation.

Here’s one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly (77) and item 6 (73) — allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (91) — allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly (95) — allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly (90) — allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 does not have strong preferences, but has relatively higher valuation for item 0 (65) — allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 and 4 highly but they are already allocated, so allocate item 1 (34) to agent 5.
7. The last remaining item, item 6, can be allocated to agent 0, who values it highly.

This allocation respects the fairness criteria, attempting to satisfy each agent's preferences fairly.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1]
}
```
