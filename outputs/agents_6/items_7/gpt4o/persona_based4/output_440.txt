Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  48  10  65  74  16  56
1  90  47   3  84  93  67  86
2  64  30  68  25  30  69  23
3  44  49  79  72  67  82  38
4   3  36  26  25  88   2  42
5  51   3  90  23   6  24  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach this problem, we need to allocate each of the 7 items to the 6 agents in a manner that attempts to be fair and envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible. A common way to achieve this is by maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible, given the constraint of having more agents than items.

### Steps and Considerations:

1. **Initial Analysis**: We have 6 agents and 7 items. Each agent should ideally receive at least one item, but since this is not possible given the constraint, some agents might receive no items.

2. **Valuation Matrix**: 
   - Agent 0: [35, 48, 10, 65, 74, 16, 56]
   - Agent 1: [90, 47, 3, 84, 93, 67, 86]
   - Agent 2: [64, 30, 68, 25, 30, 69, 23]
   - Agent 3: [44, 49, 79, 72, 67, 82, 38]
   - Agent 4: [3, 36, 26, 25, 88, 2, 42]
   - Agent 5: [51, 3, 90, 23, 6, 24, 93]

3. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by allocating items based on the highest valuations. This might not be perfectly envy-free but can lead to an efficient allocation.

4. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Allocate items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that each item is allocated only once and no agent is allocated more than they value significantly compared to others.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 4**: Most valued by Agent 1 (93).
2. **Item 5**: Most valued by Agent 3 (82).
3. **Item 6**: Most valued by Agent 5 (93).
4. **Item 3**: Most valued by Agent 0 (65).
5. **Item 2**: Most valued by Agent 5 (90), but Agent 3 values it at 79 which is still high.
6. **Item 0**: Most valued by Agent 1 (90).
7. **Item 1**: Most valued by Agent 0 (48), but Agent 3 also values it at 49.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [3, 1]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [6, 2]

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items while ensuring all items are allocated. Note that some agents may not receive items due to the constraints of the problem.
