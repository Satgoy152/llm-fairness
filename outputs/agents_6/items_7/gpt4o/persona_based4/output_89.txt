Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  98  66  59   7   6  50
1  14  35  58  28  28  81  91
2   2  80  63  66  19  22  17
3   1  98  14  56  12  80  22
4  83  74  11  96  93  65  66
5  38  10  16  41  93  92  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness can be difficult with indivisible goods and diverse preferences, so we aim to approximate this as closely as possible.

First, let's assess the valuations to identify any items that are particularly valuable to specific agents or any potential items that could be easily allocated without causing significant envy. We'll also try to ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Hereâ€™s a potential allocation considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 and item 0. Let's allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a significant value for item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 highly. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest value for item 3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 5.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an item they value relatively highly, minimizing potential envy. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation exhausts all 7 items, assigning each item to an agent in a way that considers their preferences.
