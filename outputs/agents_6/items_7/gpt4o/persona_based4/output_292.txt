Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  19  36  43  73  32  40
1  33  98  42  40  93  80  74
2   8  70  70  30  49  29  26
3  72  31  72   6  61  65  72
4  44   6  56  80  58  76  15
5  82  64  65  48   3  88  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this problem, we want to allocate the items to the agents in a way that aims to be envy-free or as fair as possible given the valuations. Since we have 7 items and 6 agents, each agent should ideally receive at least one item, and one agent will end up with two items.

The goal is to minimize envy, which means each agent should prefer their own allocation to that of any other agent, or at least not prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives Item 4, valued at 73 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Receives Item 1, valued at 98 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Receives Item 2, valued at 70 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. **Agent 3**: Receives Item 6, valued at 72 (highest value for Agent 3).
5. **Agent 4**: Receives Item 3, valued at 80 (highest value for Agent 4).
6. **Agent 5**: Receives Items 0 and 5, valued at 82 and 88 respectively (high values for Agent 5).

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's happiness based on their own valuations, and also considers giving one agent two items in a way that maintains balance and fairness overall.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 7, as required.
