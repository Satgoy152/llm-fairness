Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  86  84  67   1  93  68
1  78  99  93  56   7   5  32
2  30  22  10  87  65  99  50
3  14  44  27  12  54  54  51
4  24  64  91   9  27  58  65
5  52  66  87  88  28  90  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [30 22 10 87 65 99 50]

 [52 66 87 88 28 90 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations and aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction. A common approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) criterion, which seeks to balance the product of the utilities of the agents. 

Given the table of valuations, we will try to allocate the items so that the distribution is as fair as possible:

```
Valuations Table:
           0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0:  14  86  84  67   1  93  68
Agent 1:  78  99  93  56   7   5  32
Agent 2:  30  22  10  87  65  99  50
Agent 3:  14  44  27  12  54  54  51
Agent 4:  24  64  91   9  27  58  65
Agent 5:  52  66  87  88  28  90  74
```

### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 99, so allocate it to Agent 1.
2. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 99, so allocate it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 91, so allocate it to Agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 5 values it the highest at 88, so allocate it to Agent 5.
5. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 78, the highest among remaining allocations, so allocate it to Agent 1.
6. **Item 6**: Agent 5 values it at 74, the highest among remaining allocations, so allocate it to Agent 5.
7. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 65, the highest among remaining allocations, so allocate it to Agent 2.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: No items allocated
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 3: No items allocated
- Agent 4: Item [2]
- Agent 5: Items [3, 6]

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize satisfaction and minimize envy among the agents, given the constraints and valuations.
