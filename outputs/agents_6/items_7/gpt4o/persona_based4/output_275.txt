Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  60  84   7  43  64  47
1  72  22  37   6   5  23   4
2  88  31  81  47  93  94  37
3  57  26  44  42  41  71  82
4  70  49  23  31  76  70  28
5  27  96  69  20  84  96  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness and adhering to the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method such as the "round robin" or "sequential allocation" approach. Here, agents take turns selecting their most valued item from the remaining unallocated items. 

Given the valuations, we can simulate this process to find an equitable distribution of items among the agents. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** selects item 2 (value 84).
2. **Agent 1** selects item 0 (value 72).
3. **Agent 2** selects item 5 (value 94).
4. **Agent 3** selects item 6 (value 82).
5. **Agent 4** selects item 4 (value 76).
6. **Agent 5** selects item 1 (value 96).
7. The remaining item 3 is selected by **Agent 0** (value 7).

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. Each agent receives their most preferred items available during their turn, thereby aiming to minimize envy.
