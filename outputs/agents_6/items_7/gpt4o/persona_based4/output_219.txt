Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23   3  65  88  80  24  82
1  57  90  28  67  35  72   2
2  62  10  69  30  86  89  92
3  16  66  58  20  94  66   8
4   0  15  36  98  23  86  31
5   5  47  93  29  73  14  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for a solution that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Here is one approach to allocate the items while considering the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 highly (88), so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1's highest value is for item 1 (90), so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 highly (92), so we assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 highly (94), so we assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 3 highly, but it is already assigned to Agent 0. The next highest is item 5 (86), so we assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 2 highly (93), so we assign item 2 to Agent 5.

This leaves item 0 unassigned. To ensure all items are allocated, let's assign item 0 to Agent 4, who also has a non-zero valuation for it.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 0],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item they value highly while ensuring all 7 items are distributed.
