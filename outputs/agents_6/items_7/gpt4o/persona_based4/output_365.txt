Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  58  29  39  62  71  82
1  18  72  47  46  60  13  64
2  21  49  58  79  40  74  30
3  76  32  81  71  55  84  38
4  88   0  36  64  64  92  39
5  92  32  19  65  97  60  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given their valuations. We will try to distribute the items so that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent, and everyone feels they have received a fair share.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 the most. Allocating item 6 to agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 1 the most. Allocating item 1 to agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 3 the most. Allocating item 3 to agent 2 maximizes their satisfaction.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 the most. Allocating item 5 to agent 3 maximizes their satisfaction.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 0 the most. Allocating item 0 to agent 4 maximizes their satisfaction.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent values item 4 the most. Allocating item 4 to agent 5 maximizes their satisfaction.

Since we have 7 items to allocate, and each agent is currently allocated one item, we need to allocate the remaining item. Item 2 is the only item left. We choose to allocate it to the agent who would gain the most additional value from it without causing significant envy. 

Among agents who have not received their top choice, agent 3 values item 2 the most after their top choice. Thus, item 2 is allocated to agent 3.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance valuations and minimize envy among the agents.
