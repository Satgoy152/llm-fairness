Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  37  66  11  12   7  21
1  61  53  98  65  63  47  85
2  77  61  18  74  83   1   8
3  58  21  29  56  54  36  62
4  29  93  74  97  51  87   8
5  88  98  95   3  31  80  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents while ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible. We aim to minimize envy, meaning that each agent should be as satisfied as possible with their allocation compared to others.

One approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin or maximin strategy, where we prioritize giving each agent their most valued items while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Given there are more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Let's start by allocating items one by one, prioritizing each agent's highest-valued item that is still available:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest, but it's already taken. Next valued is item 6.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest.
6. **Agent 5** values item 1 the highest.

Now all agents have one item, and one item (5) remains unallocated. We'll allocate it to the agent who values it the most but still keeps balance in allocations:

7. **Item 5** is valued highest by Agent 4 (87). Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [3, 5]
- Agent 5: [1]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and item 5 is allocated to the agent who values it highly, given the constraints.

Now, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
