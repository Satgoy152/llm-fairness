Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  88  38  74  35  89  83
1  82  61  89  85  73  46  16
2  28  96  12  50  43  52  54
3  97  71   2  84  53  92  57
4   8  38  11  16  20  47  98
5  44  52  58  72  95  42  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents with regard to their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value. Given the constraints, here's a fair allocation approach:

1. Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents such that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 7 + 88 + 38 + 74 + 35 + 89 + 83 = 414
- Agent 1: 82 + 61 + 89 + 85 + 73 + 46 + 16 = 452
- Agent 2: 28 + 96 + 12 + 50 + 43 + 52 + 54 = 335
- Agent 3: 97 + 71 + 2 + 84 + 53 + 92 + 57 = 456
- Agent 4: 8 + 38 + 11 + 16 + 20 + 47 + 98 = 238
- Agent 5: 44 + 52 + 58 + 72 + 95 + 42 + 66 = 429

Now, we allocate items by selecting high-value items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (89), and item 1 (88).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (89), and item 3 (85).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (96).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (97), and item 5 (92).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (98).
- Agent 5 values item 4 the highest (95).

It's necessary to ensure each item is only allocated to one agent and each agent receives an integer number of items. Given these preferences, a possible fair allocation could be:

1. Agent 0 receives item 5.
2. Agent 1 receives item 2.
3. Agent 2 receives item 1.
4. Agent 3 receives item 0.
5. Agent 4 receives item 6.
6. Agent 5 receives item 4.
7. Agent 1 (or another) receives item 3 to balance allocations.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, reducing envy and making the distribution fair based on their preferences.
