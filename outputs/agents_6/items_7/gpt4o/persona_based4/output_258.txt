Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  43  44   1  54  16  46
1  19  27  16  99  18  77  93
2  24  54  65  96  67  22  33
3  14  12  96  32  70  35  10
4  48  67  60  10  85  83   2
5  89  76  72  44   0  25  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should prefer their own bundle of items over the bundles received by other agents, considering their respective valuations. Given that we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each. 

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 values item 4 the most (value 54), we can allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the most (value 99), so we can allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most (value 96), but since it's already taken, we allocate their next best item, item 2 (value 65).
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 the most (value 96), but since it's already taken, we allocate their next best available item, item 4 (value 70), but it's already taken, so we move to item 5 (value 35).
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 4 the most (value 85), but since it's already taken, we allocate their next best available item, item 1 (value 67).
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 0 the most (value 89), so we allocate item 0 to agent 5. Since agent 5 has received only one item and there is one item remaining (item 6), we also allocate item 6 to agent 5.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly and maintains the total allocation of 7 items. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```
