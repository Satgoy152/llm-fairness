Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  49  45  46  87  24  33
1  14  41  76  72  39  50  65
2  92  50  71  56  71  84  77
3  22  82  71  68  76  75  30
4  45  95  27  12  17   1  54
5   9  46  14  77  44  67  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. We will aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations, we can approach this by assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction. One way to do this is to assign the item to the agent who values it the most, provided that this results in a fair distribution of the total number of items.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations accordingly:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (87), so we assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (76), so we assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (92), so we assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (82), so we assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the highest, but it's already taken, so we look at the next highest available item, which is item 6 (54). So, we assign item 6 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 3 the highest (77), so we assign item 3 to agent 5.

This process leaves us with item 5 unassigned. We look at the remaining agents, and we can assign item 5 to agent 2, as agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5 (84).

Now, let's check:

- Agent 0 has 1 item [4].
- Agent 1 has 1 item [2].
- Agent 2 has 2 items [0, 5].
- Agent 3 has 1 item [1].
- Agent 4 has 1 item [6].
- Agent 5 has 1 item [3].

Each agent has at least one item, and 7 items are allocated in total.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```
