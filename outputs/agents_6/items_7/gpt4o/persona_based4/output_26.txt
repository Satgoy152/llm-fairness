Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  67  14  91  20  20  77
1  99  64  30  82   9  18  45
2  33  62   7  56  38  86   5
3   9  52  53   7  25  21  19
4  82  86  22  23  40  63  64
5   5  21  86  47  63  87  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, aiming to achieve envy-freeness, we can use a method that tries to maximize the minimum satisfaction each agent receives based on their valuations. This is a complex problem, but a heuristic approach can often provide a reasonably fair allocation.

First, let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0: [74, 67, 14, 91, 20, 20, 77]
- Agent 1: [99, 64, 30, 82, 9, 18, 45]
- Agent 2: [33, 62, 7, 56, 38, 86, 5]
- Agent 3: [9, 52, 53, 7, 25, 21, 19]
- Agent 4: [82, 86, 22, 23, 40, 63, 64]
- Agent 5: [5, 21, 86, 47, 63, 87, 39]

A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and adjusting to avoid envy.

**Initial Allocation:**
1. Item 0: Agent 1 (99)
2. Item 1: Agent 4 (86)
3. Item 2: Agent 5 (86)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 (91)
5. Item 4: Agent 5 (63)
6. Item 5: Agent 5 (87)
7. Item 6: Agent 0 (77)

**Adjustments for Fairness:**
- Agent 5 has been allocated 3 items (2, 4, 5), which is disproportionate.
- We need to distribute items to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

**Revised Allocation:**
- Give item 2 to Agent 5.
- Give item 0 to Agent 1.
- Give item 1 to Agent 4.
- Give item 3 to Agent 0.
- Give item 4 to Agent 2.
- Give item 5 to Agent 3.
- Give item 6 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest preferences and ensures no item is left unallocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```
