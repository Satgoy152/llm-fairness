Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  68  34  62  40   0  93
1  75  25  38  35  50  70   7
2  40  83  43  47  30  82  44
3  85  31   5  93   9  35  26
4  79  90   4  59  45  81  84
5   7  29  59  69  53  44  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll use a strategy that attempts to minimize envy by considering the valuations each agent has for each item. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item and the total value of the allocation for each agent is as balanced as possible given their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [0, 6] - Total value = 61 + 93 = 154
2. **Agent 1**: Item [5] - Total value = 70
3. **Agent 2**: Item [1] - Total value = 83
4. **Agent 3**: Item [3] - Total value = 93
5. **Agent 4**: Item [4] - Total value = 45
6. **Agent 5**: Item [2] - Total value = 59

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives an item they value relatively highly, and the values are spread out. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated among the agents.
