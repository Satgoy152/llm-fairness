Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  75  74  51  51  24  86
1  34   9  55  12  59  13  42
2  94  36  98  34  37  24  17
3  32  76  60  50  43  62  94
4  65  20  82   9  75  48  52
5  95   4  66  23  94   0  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we'll employ the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to minimize the envy among agents regarding the allocation of items. While absolute envy-freeness might not be possible in every scenario, especially given the constraints of integer allocations and discrete items, we can strive to make the allocation as fair as possible. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Identify each agent's highest-valued items**: Each agent should initially be considered for their most highly valued items. However, we need to ensure that every item is allocated uniquely.

2. **Assign items to maximize individual valuations while minimizing envy**: We start by assigning items based on the highest value for each agent, checking for overlaps, and resolving them by considering the second-highest valued items or the overall distribution of item values.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (86), so we can assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (59), so we assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (98), so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most (94), but since it's already taken, we consider the next highest, item 1 (76).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most (82), but since it's already taken, we consider the next highest, item 4 (75). However, item 4 is taken, so the next is item 0 (65).
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most (95), but since it's taken, we consider the next highest, item 4 (94). However, item 4 is taken, so the next is item 2 (66), also taken. The next is item 3 (23).

Now, we check if all items are allocated and no agent is assigned more than one item unless necessary.

After resolving conflicts and ensuring all items are allocated, here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items, with agent 5 receiving two items to ensure all items are allocated. The allocation attempts to minimize envy, recognizing that perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable in this setup.
