Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43   3  14  80  95   6  96
1  34  55  70  39  50  31  47
2  96  31   3  53  67  39  73
3  26  69  70  31  55  59  55
4  96  57  29  66  23  21  60
5  72  85  47  28  65  89  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent to their own.

The goal is to distribute the 7 items among the 6 agents such that each agent receives at least one item and no agent is envious of another's allocation.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [43, 3, 14, 80, 95, 6, 96]
- Agent 1: [34, 55, 70, 39, 50, 31, 47]
- Agent 2: [96, 31, 3, 53, 67, 39, 73]
- Agent 3: [26, 69, 70, 31, 55, 59, 55]
- Agent 4: [96, 57, 29, 66, 23, 21, 60]
- Agent 5: [72, 85, 47, 28, 65, 89, 79]

To find a fair allocation, let's use a heuristic approach to distribute these items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items.

### Allocation Strategy

1. Start by giving each agent their highest-valued item, ensuring no item is repeated.
2. If any items remain, allocate them based on the next highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

### Allocation Steps

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 96).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 70).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 96).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 2, but it’s already allocated, so take item 1 (value 69).
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 0, but it’s already allocated, so take item 3 (value 66).
- **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (value 89).

This covers items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. Item 4 is left, so it will be allocated to the agent with the highest remaining valuation for it.

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (value 95) is unallocated and has the highest valuation for agent 0.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize individual satisfaction based on their valuations.
