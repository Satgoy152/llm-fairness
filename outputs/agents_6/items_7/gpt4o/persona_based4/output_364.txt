Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  19  48  68  27  62  40
1  17  26  58  76  90  82  36
2  42  20  57  25  64  50  56
3  60   4  92   9  75  74  38
4  74  55  95  73  19  62  28
5  12  97  19  90  27  61  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents that minimizes envy, we can begin by analyzing the given valuations. This involves attempting to distribute items so that each agent feels they received fair value compared to their peers. One common approach is to ensure that each agent's allocation maximizes their total perceived value.

Let's consider an approach where we aim to balance the total value received by each agent based on their preferences. Since we have 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive two items.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

- Assign item 4 to agent 1 because it has the highest value for that agent.
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 because it has the highest value for that agent.
- Assign item 5 to agent 4 because it has the highest value for that agent.
- Assign item 0 to agent 5 because it has the highest value for that agent.
- Assign item 1 to agent 5, as it has a relatively high value for that agent and helps balance the distribution.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 because it has the second-highest value for that agent.
- Assign item 6 to agent 2 to give them a fair share of total value.

Let's finalize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences, given the constraint of integer allocations.
