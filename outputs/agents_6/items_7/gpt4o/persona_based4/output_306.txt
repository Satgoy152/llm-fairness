Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77   6  81  58  86  55  14
1   3  41  44  56  32  79  52
2  29  37  64  69  91   2  10
3  68  70  19  96  45  95  23
4   9  22   1  90  24  54  49
5  38  97  77  51  69  43   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a manner that aims to minimize envy, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute them so that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Given the valuations, one approach is to look for an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives.

Here are the initial valuations:

- Agent 0: [77, 6, 81, 58, 86, 55, 14]
- Agent 1: [3, 41, 44, 56, 32, 79, 52]
- Agent 2: [29, 37, 64, 69, 91, 2, 10]
- Agent 3: [68, 70, 19, 96, 45, 95, 23]
- Agent 4: [9, 22, 1, 90, 24, 54, 49]
- Agent 5: [38, 97, 77, 51, 69, 43, 8]

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that aims for an envy-free (or at least envy-minimized) distribution. A potential solution is to allocate items based on maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, aiming for fairness:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest, so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest, so assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest, but it's already taken, so assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken, so assign item 5, the next highest, to Agent 3, but it's already taken, so assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken, so assign item 5, the next highest, to Agent 4, but it's already taken, so assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 the highest, so assign item 1 to Agent 5.

Now, let's check if any items remain unallocated and distribute them to agents with the least total value:

- Item 2 remains unallocated, and Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 2 after item 1, so assign item 2 to Agent 5.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation is designed to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints of the problem.
