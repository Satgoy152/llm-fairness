Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19   1  25  11  64  75  45
1  62  35  74  97  45  13  78
2  71  26  33   0  10  77  70
3  92  62  57  35  19  28  38
4  43  36  41  59  55  73  31
5  16  86   4  23  20   6  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items among the agents in such a way that the allocation is considered fair. A common fairness criterion is envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

To approach this, we can use a method to ensure that each agent has a fair share based on their valuations. One way to do this is to allocate items iteratively to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent has at least one item if possible, and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Let's analyze the agent valuations and make the allocations:

1. Start by identifying the highest valued items for each agent to ensure no initial envy.
2. Allocate items based on highest value preference until all items are allocated.
3. Ensure that allocations are balanced and as close to envy-free as possible.

Here's an allocation strategy based on these principles:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (75), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 3 (97), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (77), but it's already taken, so allocate item 0 (71) to agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 (92), so allocate item 0 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 5 (73), but it's already taken, so allocate item 3 (59) to agent 4.
- Agent 5 highly values item 1 (86), so allocate item 1 to agent 5.
- Now allocate remaining items to balance allocations and maximize fairness.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [1, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total allocation is exactly 7 items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```
