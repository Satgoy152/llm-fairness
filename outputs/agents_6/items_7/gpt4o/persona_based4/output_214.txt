Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76   4  29   7  64  53   9
1   2  81  82  23  98  14  12
2  80  88  50  28  15  23  34
3  31  58  74  13  79  81  70
4   0  31  31  66  10  81  73
5   1  58  67  82  35  99  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, while trying to achieve envy-freeness or minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.

Envy-freeness is a state where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent values their allocation. Given the small number of items and the diverse valuations, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can aim to minimize envy.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that balances the total value as fairly as possible across agents:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (76) and item 4 (64).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (98) and item 2 (82).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (88) and item 0 (80).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (81) and item 4 (79).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 5 (81) and item 6 (73).
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 5 (99) and item 3 (82).

Given these observations, let us attempt an allocation:

- Assign items in a way that each agent gets at least one of their higher valued items, if possible, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0] (item 0 is highly valued by Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: [2] (item 2 is highly valued by Agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: [1] (item 1 is highly valued by Agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: [4] (item 4 is highly valued by Agent 3)
- **Agent 4**: [6] (item 6 is one of the higher valued items for Agent 4)
- **Agent 5**: [3, 5] (item 5 is highest valued by Agent 5, item 3 is also valued)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value relatively highly, which helps minimize envy. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```
