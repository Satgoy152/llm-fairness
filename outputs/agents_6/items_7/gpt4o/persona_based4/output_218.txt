Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  18  64  96  52  90  81
1  34  52  59  15  70  34  16
2   2  33  69   5  75  39  42
3  90  38  75   9  82  61  22
4  74  99  13  40   7  22  55
5  94  48  28  80  48  12  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they have received the best or an equivalent share in comparison to others, based on their valuation. Given the valuations provided, we will attempt to distribute the items in such a way that each agent's perceived value of their allocation is as close to equal as possible.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 496
- Agent 1: 280
- Agent 2: 265
- Agent 3: 377
- Agent 4: 310
- Agent 5: 338

We will allocate the items to maximize each agent's total perceived value while keeping the distribution as fair as possible.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3 (Value: 95 + 96 = 191)
- Agent 1 receives items 4, 1 (Value: 70 + 52 = 122)
- Agent 2 receives items 2 (Value: 69)
- Agent 3 receives items 5 (Value: 61)
- Agent 4 receives items 6 (Value: 55)
- Agent 5 receives no items (Value: 0)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, the total number of allocated items is 7, and attempts to balance perceived value distribution among agents.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": []
}
```
