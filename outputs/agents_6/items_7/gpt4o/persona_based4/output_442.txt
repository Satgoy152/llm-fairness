Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  12  90   3  17  74  34
1  41   8  47  25   5  46  81
2  58  84  20  20  81  19  22
3  16  31  15  39  79  41   2
4  82  65  22  26   0  21  96
5  52  82  54  65  57  59  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 6 agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division, where each agent feels they have received the best bundle according to their own valuations. Although achieving perfect envy-freeness is often unattainable, especially with integer constraints, we can still try to make the allocation as fair as possible.

I'll use a simple allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive while ensuring that all items are allocated. This approach involves assigning items to agents who value them the most until all items are distributed.

Let's carefully allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation by Agent 4 (82)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 4.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation by Agent 2 (84)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest valuation by Agent 0 (90)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest valuation by Agent 5 (65)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 5.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest valuation by Agent 2 (81)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest valuation by Agent 0 (74)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest valuation by Agent 4 (96)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent their most valued items while ensuring all items are distributed. Note that Agent 1 and Agent 3 do not receive any items, as their valuations did not lead to them being assigned any of the items over other agents.
