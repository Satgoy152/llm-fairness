Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  54  48  91  38   0  21
1   8  34  55   5  73  22  57
2  94  54  35  87  85  16  82
3  91  61  18  82  49  89  79
4  13  46  65   4  66  29  88
5  93  97  96  58  32  48   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 54 48 91 38  0 21]
 [ 8 34 55  5 73 22 57]
 [94 54 35 87 85 16 82]
 [91 61 18 82 49 89 79]
 [13 46 65  4 66 29 88]
 [93 97 96 58 32 48  2]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, if possible. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by any other agent over their own bundle, given their valuations.

### Valuations Table

- Agent 0: [75, 54, 48, 91, 38, 0, 21]
- Agent 1: [8, 34, 55, 5, 73, 22, 57]
- Agent 2: [94, 54, 35, 87, 85, 16, 82]
- Agent 3: [91, 61, 18, 82, 49, 89, 79]
- Agent 4: [13, 46, 65, 4, 66, 29, 88]
- Agent 5: [93, 97, 96, 58, 32, 48, 2]

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 5** highly values items 1, 2, and 0, with valuations of 97, 96, and 93 respectively. Allocating these items to Agent 5 makes sense as these are the highest valuations for these items across all agents.

2. **Agent 2** highly values items 3, 4, and 6, with valuations of 87, 85, and 82. Allocating these items to Agent 2 is beneficial for maximizing this agent's satisfaction.

3. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 5, at 89, which is the highest for this item. Allocating this item to Agent 3 would be beneficial for this agent.

### Allocation Proposal

Given the above considerations, we can make the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [] (no items)
- Agent 1: [] (no items)
- Agent 2: [3, 4, 6] (total value: 87 + 85 + 82 = 254)
- Agent 3: [5] (total value: 89)
- Agent 4: [] (no items)
- Agent 5: [0, 1, 2] (total value: 93 + 97 + 96 = 286)

This allocation ensures that agents receive the items they value most highly, which helps minimize envy. Note that some agents (0, 1, and 4) do not receive any items, but the overall allocation focuses on minimizing envy for the agents with strong preferences.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 4, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items and aims to be as fair as possible under the given valuation constraints.
