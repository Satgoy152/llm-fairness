Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  98  32  34  75  34  83
1  31  21  85  88  45  12  96
2  86  32  65  91  98  89  60
3  40  17  49  54  76  13  84
4  62  48  52  84  86  81  33
5  15  76  69  52  41  44  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. This means that each agent should feel that they received a fair share of items based on their valuations. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to what they perceive as valuable.

Let's examine the table of valuations and identify potential allocations:

Agent 0 Values: [54, 98, 32, 34, 75, 34, 83]
Agent 1 Values: [31, 21, 85, 88, 45, 12, 96]
Agent 2 Values: [86, 32, 65, 91, 98, 89, 60]
Agent 3 Values: [40, 17, 49, 54, 76, 13, 84]
Agent 4 Values: [62, 48, 52, 84, 86, 81, 33]
Agent 5 Values: [15, 76, 69, 52, 41, 44, 93]

To allocate the items fairly, we can follow a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction by prioritizing items based on their highest valuations. Here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (98).
- Agent 1 highly values item 6 (96).
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (98).
- Agent 3 highly values item 6 (84). However, since item 6 is already allocated to Agent 1, let's give them item 4 (76), the next highest available.
- Agent 4 highly values item 4 (86). Since item 4 is already allocated, let's give them item 5 (81).
- Agent 5 highly values item 6 (93). Since item 6 is already allocated, let's give them item 1 (76), the next highest available.

After initially allocating the highest-valued items, we will ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust any conflicts by considering the next highest available items for each agent.

The final allocation is as follows:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly relative to their preferences, and all items are allocated fairly.
