Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  49  69  34  97  78  98
1  79  91   3  19  72  68  69
2  45  40  62  80  29  79   2
3  37  34  65  24  91  38  64
4  98  71  74  62  30  74  49
5  39  10  77  35  97  44  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 49 69 34 97 78 98]
 [79 91  3 19 72 68 69]
 [45 40 62 80 29 79  2]
 [37 34 65 24 91 38 64]
 [98 71 74 62 30 74 49]
 [39 10 77 35 97 44 33]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll use a method that attempts to balance the valuations and ensure that no agent envies another's allocation too much. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items and the others will receive one item each.

Here's one way to approach a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate the most valued item to each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. Allocate the remaining item to the agent whose total valuation is the lowest, to balance the overall perceived fairness.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

- Agent 0: [82, 49, 69, 34, 97, 78, 98]
- Agent 1: [79, 91, 3, 19, 72, 68, 69]
- Agent 2: [45, 40, 62, 80, 29, 79, 2]
- Agent 3: [37, 34, 65, 24, 91, 38, 64]
- Agent 4: [98, 71, 74, 62, 30, 74, 49]
- Agent 5: [39, 10, 77, 35, 97, 44, 33]

Total valuation per agent:
- Agent 0: 507
- Agent 1: 401
- Agent 2: 337
- Agent 3: 353
- Agent 4: 458
- Agent 5: 335

Allocate the highest valued item to each agent initially:
- Agent 0: Item 6 (value 98)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 91)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (value 79)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (value 91)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (value 98)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (value 77)

The remaining item is Item 3. Allocating it to the agent with the lowest total valuation after this initial allocation (Agent 5), we balance the distribution.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [2, 3]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2, 3]
}
```
