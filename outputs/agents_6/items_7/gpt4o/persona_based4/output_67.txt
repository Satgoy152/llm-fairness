Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  52  41  77  64  68  87
1  82  41  86  35  74  63  30
2  30  80  36  49  22  25  96
3  85  42  57  86  59  48  51
4  26  57  66  13  65  67  89
5  68   9  73  55  85  88  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with envy-freeness in mind, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations, minimizing any potential envy.

We'll use a simple heuristic approach: allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation for the unallocated items, one at a time.

Here's a possible allocation that achieves these objectives:

1. Allocate item 6 to agent 2 (highest value among all agents for item 6).
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 2 (highest remaining value for item 1).
3. Allocate item 3 to agent 3 (highest remaining value for item 3).
4. Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (highest remaining value for item 0).
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 5 (highest remaining value for item 4).
6. Allocate item 5 to agent 5 (highest remaining value for item 5).
7. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (highest remaining value for item 2).

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
