Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23   5  61  93  19  84  45
1  47  65  54   8  59  23  61
2  83  57  23  24  71  71  58
3  72  19   2  57  65   9  36
4  28  49  97  71  68  48  44
5  56  36  50  93  64   0  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 57 23 24 71 71 58]

 [56 36 50 93 64  0 34]]
Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can apply a strategy that tries to minimize envy and distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation for the items they receive. The goal is to make sure each agent gets a reasonable portion of their most valued items while ensuring that all items are allocated.

### Analysis of Agent Valuations:
1. **Agent 0**: Highest values for item 3 (93) and item 5 (84).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values for item 1 (65) and item 6 (61).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values for item 0 (83) and item 4 (71).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values for item 0 (72) and item 4 (65).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values for item 2 (97) and item 3 (71).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest values for item 3 (93) and item 0 (56).

### Allocation Plan:
We'll attempt to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's top preferences, while ensuring all items are distributed.

1. **Item 3**: Highly valued by Agents 0, 4, and 5. Allocate to Agent 0, as it provides a high valuation (93).
2. **Item 5**: Highly valued by Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 1**: Highly valued by Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 6**: Highly valued by Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 0**: Highly valued by Agents 2 and 3. Allocate to Agent 2, as it provides the highest valuation (83).
6. **Item 4**: Highly valued by Agents 2 and 3. Allocate to Agent 2, as it complements their allocation.
7. **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 4. Allocate to Agent 4.

### Final Allocations:
After reviewing the valuations and considering the constraints, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are fairly distributed among them.
