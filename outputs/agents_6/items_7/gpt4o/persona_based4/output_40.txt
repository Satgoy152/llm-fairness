Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  43  34  91  42  41  67
1  74  49  89  61  39  63  46
2  14  20  91  19  72  22  97
3  55  41  32  71  74  42   9
4  77  52  81  93  41  35  26
5  81  77  89  58  47  95  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations table:

```
Agent \ Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
-------------|---------------------------
      0      |  2  43  34  91  42  41  67
      1      | 74  49  89  61  39  63  46
      2      | 14  20  91  19  72  22  97
      3      | 55  41  32  71  74  42   9
      4      | 77  52  81  93  41  35  26
      5      | 81  77  89  58  47  95  40
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we will use a simple method that attempts to maximize each agent's happiness by assigning them their most valued remaining items iteratively. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 5**: Highly values item 5 (95). Assign item 5.
2. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 6 (97). Assign item 6.
3. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 3 (93). Assign item 3.
4. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 3 (but already allocated). Next highest is item 2 (34). Assign item 2.
5. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 2 (but already allocated). Next highest is item 0 (74). Assign item 0.
6. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 4 (74). Assign item 4.
7. **Agent 4**: Next highest available item is 1 (52). Assign item 1.

Now all items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the agents' preferences as much as possible given the constraints. Note that such allocations might not be perfectly envy-free due to the discrete and limited nature of the items and the specific valuations, but it aims to minimize potential envy.
