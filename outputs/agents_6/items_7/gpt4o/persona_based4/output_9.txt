Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  46  66  84  75  76  80
1   7  69  62  60  59  12  58
2  77  34   6  77  27  52   2
3  28  24  44  67   6  57  86
4  73   7   1  42  14  77  94
5  15   1  75  95  48  20  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items that another agent has received over their own bundle.

Let's attempt an allocation that tries to maximize individual satisfaction and balance:

1. Calculate total valuations for each agent and attempt to allocate items to balance their total values.
2. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

After analyzing the valuations, the allocation can be made as follows:

- Agent 0 has high valuations on items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. Item 3 is also highly valued.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most, but it's already allocated to Agent 3. Item 5 is another option.
- Agent 5 highly values item 3, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. Item 2 is another option.

Considering these observations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Item [6]
- Agent 4: Item [5]
- Agent 5: Item [2]

This allocation aims to give each agent an item they value highly, and Agent 0 receives two items because of their high valuation for item 0 and 3.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item while attempting to maximize their individual satisfaction based on their valuations.
