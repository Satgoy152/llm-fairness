Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  57  58  38  63   5  45
1   6  51  87  97  50  44  88
2  27  84  19  89  84  21  71
3  14  72  80  55  61  85  87
4  87  48  99  72  53  23  17
5  13  48  48   7  82  86  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness based on the agents' valuations of the items. One approach to achieve this is to use the "Envy-Free" method and "Maximin" approach, ensuring each agent receives at least one item or a fair value distribution.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are item 4 (value 63) and item 2 (value 58). Allocating item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest with a valuation of 97, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 84. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: For Agent 3, item 6 has the highest valuation of 87. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2 at 99. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 5 the most at 86. Allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, all but one item (item 0) has been allocated, and we have a situation where every agent has received one item.

The last item (item 0) has the highest valuation from Agent 4 (value 87), but Agent 4 already has an item with their highest value. Considering the relatively low value of item 0 among all agents, we can allocate item 0 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is aimed at minimizing envy based on the given valuations.
