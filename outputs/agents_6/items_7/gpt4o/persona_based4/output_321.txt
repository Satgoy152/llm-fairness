Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  58  35  87   4  28  33
1  70  21  12  57  90  22  51
2  68  18  93  43  49   5  57
3  61   3  22  53  51  77  77
4  59  69  59  72  46  96  22
5  88  27  55  77  74  11  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy among agents, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items and seek a balance that maximizes individual satisfaction. The goal is to distribute the items in a manner where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuation. Given the constraints and the need for integer allocations, here is one possible fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent.
2. Allocate items iteratively by checking which agent values the remaining items the most and has the least envy.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values Item 4 the highest (value of 90).
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 2:** Agent 2 values Item 2 the highest (value of 93).
3. **Assign Item 5 to Agent 4:** Agent 4 values Item 5 the highest (value of 96).
4. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 5:** Agent 5 values Item 0 the highest (value of 88).
5. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest and equal to Item 0 (value of 87), but Item 0 is already taken.
6. **Assign Item 6 to Agent 3:** Agent 3 values Item 6 the highest (value of 77).
7. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:** This item is left, and Agent 0 values it significantly (value of 58).

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed.
