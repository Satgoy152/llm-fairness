Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  94   3  15  67  48  52
1  35   0  80  42  84  54  21
2  95  30  72  29  55  93  19
3   6  89  46  30   3  86  72
4  48  42  51  64  75  57  40
5  62  95  97  30  86  26  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents such that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Since there are more items than agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

One common approach in fair division is to use the "max-min" strategy, where we try to maximize the minimum valuation that each agent receives. Given the valuations provided, we can attempt to assign items to agents by iteratively allocating the item that increases an agent's minimum valuation the most while respecting the constraint that each agent should receive at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is item 1 (94). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is item 4 (84). Assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is item 0 (95). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is item 1 (89), but it's taken. The second-highest is item 5 (86). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is item 4 (75), but it's taken. The second-highest is item 3 (64). Assign item 3 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is item 2 (97). Assign item 2 to agent 5.

At this point, each agent has at least one item, and we have allocated 6 out of the 7 items. We need to allocate one more item. The remaining unallocated item is item 6.

Let's determine which agent should receive the remaining item (item 6) by considering who would benefit most:

- Agent 0: Item 6 value is 52.
- Agent 1: Item 6 value is 21.
- Agent 2: Item 6 value is 19.
- Agent 3: Item 6 value is 72.
- Agent 4: Item 6 value is 40.
- Agent 5: Item 6 value is 71.

Agent 3 values item 6 the most after item 5, which they already have. Assign item 6 to agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 7.
