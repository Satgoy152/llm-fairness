Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  22   5  18  51  35  67
1  10  65  14   2  18  73  74
2  24  71  24  93  16  11  10
3  80  48  63  73   7  66  29
4  61  72  87  95  27  55  66
5  36  95  66   8  81  31   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their individual valuations. Since each agent will receive an integer number of items and the total number of items equals seven, we need to ensure each agent's allocation is as fair as possible given their preferences.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to the agent who values it the most, provided it doesn't cause significant imbalance.**
2. **Repeat this process while checking if any improvement can be made for any agent without causing envy from others.**

Let's go through the allocations:

- **Item 0:** Agent 3 values it the most at 80.
- **Item 1:** Agent 5 values it the most at 95.
- **Item 2:** Agent 4 values it the most at 87.
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it the most at 51.
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 values it the most at 73.
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it highly at 74, after accounting for Item 1 which Agent 5 values more.

Now, ensure that no agent feels envious:

- Agent 0 has Item 4.
- Agent 1 has Items 5 and 6.
- Agent 2 has Item 3.
- Agent 3 has Item 0.
- Agent 4 has Item 2.
- Agent 5 has Item 1.

This allocation seems fair as it considers each agent's highest valuations without creating envy based on the given preferences.

Here's the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
