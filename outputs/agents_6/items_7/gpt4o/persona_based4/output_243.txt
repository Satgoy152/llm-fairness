Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  61  95  97  93  51  34
1  87  25  59  79  23  98  81
2  46  12  73  77   7  20  53
3  79  45  13   6  46  78  29
4  12  61  60  27   0   3  45
5  95  95  81  77   9  61  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a way that is envy-free as much as possible, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility based on their valuation of the items. Given there are 6 agents and 7 items, some agents will get more items than others. To ensure no agent envies another based on the allocation, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations.

Let's try to allocate the items step-by-step:

1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 97.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 98.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 73.
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 79.
   - Agent 4 values item 1 the highest at 61.
   - Agent 5 values item 0 and item 1 equally the highest at 95.

2. Allocate these highest-value items to the corresponding agents, trying to give each agent their top choice or a near top choice if conflicts arise:
   - Agent 0 gets item 3.
   - Agent 1 gets item 5.
   - Agent 2 gets item 2.
   - Agent 3 gets item 0.
   - Agent 4 gets item 1.
   - Agent 5 gets item 6.

3. Resolve any conflicts or remaining items:
   - Agent 5's highest value items (0 and 1) were taken, so they get item 6 as it is the next highest value for them.
   - The remaining item 4 has a low valuation for most agents, so allocate it to the agent with the least currently valued portfolio: Agent 5.

Now we have allocated all items. Here's the final allocation, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and agents receive items that maximize their utility to the extent possible given the constraints.
