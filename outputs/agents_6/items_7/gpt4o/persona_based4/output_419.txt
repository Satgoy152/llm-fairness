Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  76  70  99  12  31  70
1  65  20  34  85   0  81  64
2  34  13  94  67   1  83  81
3  87  86  92  75  11  18  19
4  37  33   3  67  33  53  91
5   8  73  43  53  83  37  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuation. Given the nature of the problem, we'll attempt to allocate items such that no agent envies another agent's bundle based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Each agent has different high-value items which we can prioritize in allocation to satisfy them. 

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction by prioritizing their highest valued items.

3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:**
   - Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, at least one agent must receive 2 items. We'll ensure that this allocation does not cause envy by carefully selecting the second item for one of the agents with lower overall valuation.

### Allocation Strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (99) and item 1 (76).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (65).
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (94).
- Agent 3 values item 0 and 1 highly, but we already have these allocated, so we look for the next best option.
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly (91).
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly (83).

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [3]
- **Agent 1:** Items [0]
- **Agent 2:** Items [2]
- **Agent 3:** Items [5]
- **Agent 4:** Items [6]
- **Agent 5:** Items [4, 1]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an item they value highly, and the additional item assigned to Agent 5 is a reasonable fit given their preferences. This should help maintain envy-freeness or at least minimize envy.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 1]
}
```
