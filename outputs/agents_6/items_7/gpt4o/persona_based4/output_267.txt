Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  42  27  90  28  79  91
1  97  75  91  17  28   3  10
2  23  17  36   5  88  43  20
3  16  37  60  34  15  74  24
4  70  36  72  91  26  62   4
5  16  46  72  16  13  44  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, let's attempt to allocate the items in a manner that maximizes each agent's total perceived value from their allocated items.

Hereâ€™s one possible approach:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 highly and item 2.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 3.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 highly.

By analyzing these preferences, we can make an allocation that tries to maximize individual satisfaction and minimize envy:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value of 97 for agent 1)
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 5 (value of 46 for agent 5)
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 5 (value of 72 for agent 5)
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value of 90 for agent 0)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value of 88 for agent 2)
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (value of 74 for agent 3)
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value of 91 for agent 0)

This distribution attempts to reflect the highest value items for each agent based on their individual preferences, while ensuring each item is allocated. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items, with Agent 4 not receiving any items due to their lower valuations relative to the other agents' preferences.
