Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1   0  90  39  90  50  66
1  66  98  97  73  73  18  59
2  86  66  72   2   9  25  14
3  44  60   1   9  49  70  82
4  54  93  24  93  74  77  48
5  11  39  61  50  90  86  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use concepts such as envy-freeness and maximizing total valuation. However, achieving complete envy-freeness might not be possible for all cases with integer allocations, but we can aim to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

Let's approach this by trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation based on maximizing the total valuations for agents:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 and item 4 highly (90 each). Let's allocate item 4 to this agent.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highly (98). Let's allocate item 1 to this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 highly (86). Let's allocate item 0 to this agent.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 highly (82). Let's allocate item 6 to this agent.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 highly (93). Let's allocate item 3 to this agent.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 5 highly (86). Let's allocate item 5 to this agent.

This leaves item 2, which is valued highly by agent 1 (97). Since Agent 1 already has item 1, let's re-evaluate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has already received item 4.
- Agent 1 has received item 1.
- Agent 2 could take item 2, since they value item 2 (72) reasonably well.

Now let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items by considering the highest value each agent places on the remaining items. Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
