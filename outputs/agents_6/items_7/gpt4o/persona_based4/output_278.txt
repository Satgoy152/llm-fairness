Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  55  39   1  48  81  60
1  54  87  26  83  64  52  81
2  36  35  23  67  17  92  60
3  60  48  44  18  88  90  39
4  84  90  59  29   5  52  72
5  49  73  57  85  95  38   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent is as content as possible with their allocation, given their valuations. We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction, attempting to make each agent as least envious as possible by considering their preferences.

Here's the allocation process:

1. **List each agent's highest valued items**: Identify the items each agent values the most.
2. **Assign items based on highest valuations**: Attempt to assign items to agents based on their top preferences, while ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent and no agent receives more than one item initially.
3. **Reevaluate and adjust**: If any items are left unassigned, or if adjustments are needed to ensure a fair distribution, reallocate based on secondary preferences or by trading items to improve overall satisfaction.

After applying the above steps to the table of valuations, here's a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 5 (value: 81)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value: 87)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 (value: 60)
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (value: 88)
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 (value: 59)
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 3 (value: 85)

This allocation leaves item 0 (valued by Agent 4 at 84 and Agent 1 at 54) unassigned. Assign it to Agent 4 because they value it the most among remaining allocations.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 2],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their preferences, given the constraints of the problem.
