Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  73  20  20  94  11  37
1  35  85  93  78   0  72  62
2  12   9   8  70  35  51  38
3  91  15   5  43  22  62  94
4  36  40   8  99  37  57  36
5  74  58  10  31  87  23  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation. Given the constraint of integer allocations and the need to allocate exactly 7 items, we can use a heuristic approach to approximate an envy-free allocation.

1. **Identify High Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - For each agent, identify the item with the highest valuation.

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Total Valuation:**
   - Attempt to allocate items such that the total valuation across all agents is maximized.
   - Ensure that no agent is overly dissatisfied compared to others, trying to minimize envy.

3. **Consider Balanced Allocations:**
   - Try to balance the number of items each agent receives, given the constraint of allocating exactly 7 items.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 4 the highest (94).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 2 the highest (93).
- **Agent 2:** Values item 3 the highest (70).
- **Agent 3:** Values item 6 the highest (94).
- **Agent 4:** Values item 3 the highest (99).
- **Agent 5:** Values item 0 the highest (74).

Based on these observations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 4.
   - Agent 1 gets item 2.
   - Agent 3 gets item 6.
   - Agent 4 gets item 3.

2. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 5.
   - Allocate the remaining items to maximize individual satisfaction while keeping envy minimal:
     - Agent 5 gets item 0.
     - Agent 0 gets item 1 (second-highest value after item 4).
     - Agent 2 gets item 5.

Now, each agent has received an item or items based on their high valuation preferences. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued items and attempts to balance the envy across agents.
