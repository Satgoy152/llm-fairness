Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  11   4  70  35  40  26
1  58  51  14  49  58  39  33
2  99  73  87  17  28  46  78
3  22  29  16  67   6   4  50
4  23   6  24  35  67   5  91
5   9  55  94  28  25  20  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the items among the agents in a way that is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.

We will evaluate the valuations provided by each agent for each item and attempt to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation. A common approach in fair division is to try to maximize the minimum satisfaction or minimize envy among agents.

Let's consider the valuations table:

```
Agent\Item   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0           53  11   4  70  35  40  26
1           58  51  14  49  58  39  33
2           99  73  87  17  28  46  78
3           22  29  16  67   6   4  50
4           23   6  24  35  67   5  91
5            9  55  94  28  25  20  65
```

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Assign high-value items to agents with the highest valuation for those items** to minimize envy.
2. **Ensure that each agent receives at least one item** where possible, considering fairness.
3. **Distribute remaining items** based on maximizing the total satisfaction or minimizing envy.

Here is a proposed allocation based on the valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (70).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (58).
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (99), but since it's already taken, the next is item 2 (87).
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 (67), but since it's already taken, the next is item 6 (50).
- Agent 4 highly values item 6 (91).
- Agent 5 highly values item 2 (94).

Taking into account potential conflicts and attempting to keep allocations fair, we can propose the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent's highest or next highest valued item is considered, and all items are allocated. Note that some agents may not receive an item due to the limited number of items and the need to maintain fairness.
