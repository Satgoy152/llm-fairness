Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  39  59  26  46  53  19
1  54  94  96  31  50  61  68
2   5  14  35  56  49  61  96
3   1  45   0  38  76  34  15
4  46   4  34   4  79  81   9
5  33  41  19  12  10  73   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we can try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuation while considering the overall fairness of the distribution. Given the constraints, we can use a simple allocation strategy based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free as possible. However, achieving complete envy-freeness can be challenging with discrete items and different valuations.

One approach is to iteratively allocate items one by one to the agent who values them most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and then balancing the allocations for fairness.

Below is a possible allocation of the items to the agents, aiming for fairness:

1. **Allocate item 2 to agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (96).
2. **Allocate item 6 to agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (96).
3. **Allocate item 4 to agent 4:** Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (79).
4. **Allocate item 5 to agent 4:** Agent 4 values item 5 the second highest (81).
5. **Allocate item 3 to agent 3:** Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (38).
6. **Allocate item 0 to agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (48).
7. **Allocate item 1 to agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 the highest after item 2 (94).

This allocation aims to provide each agent with at least one high-valued item according to their preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation maximizes individual valuations and attempts to distribute the items fairly among the agents. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness is not possible with such diverse valuations and a limited number of items. However, this approach aims to minimize envy by assigning each agent their most valued item whenever possible.
