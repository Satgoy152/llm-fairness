Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  28  75  81  94  48  97
1  93  54  71   5  23  60  75
2  55   4  80  70  40  91  54
3  59  93  79   3  11  35   9
4  92  75  64  58  60  41  27
5  66  71  78  29  22  50  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations. Given the table of valuations, we will attempt to distribute the items in a manner that approaches this concept of fairness.

Here is a procedure to achieve a reasonably fair allocation:

1. **List the total valuation of each agent for all items** to understand their overall preferences. This helps in identifying which agents might benefit the most from particular items:

   - Agent 0: 90 + 28 + 75 + 81 + 94 + 48 + 97 = 513
   - Agent 1: 93 + 54 + 71 + 5 + 23 + 60 + 75 = 381
   - Agent 2: 55 + 4 + 80 + 70 + 40 + 91 + 54 = 394
   - Agent 3: 59 + 93 + 79 + 3 + 11 + 35 + 9 = 289
   - Agent 4: 92 + 75 + 64 + 58 + 60 + 41 + 27 = 417
   - Agent 5: 66 + 71 + 78 + 29 + 22 + 50 + 22 = 338

2. **Allocate items based on each agent's highest valuation** for items that have not yet been allocated. This tends to ensure that agents are receiving items that they value the most, which often helps in minimizing envy.

Following this allocation strategy, here is a possible allocation of items:

- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (97)
- **Item 0**: Next highest is valued by Agent 1 (93)
- **Item 1**: Next highest is valued by Agent 3 (93)
- **Item 5**: Next highest is valued by Agent 2 (91)
- **Item 3**: Next highest is valued by Agent 4 (58)
- **Item 2**: Next highest is valued by Agent 5 (78)
- **Item 4**: Next highest is valued by Agent 0 (94), but already has item 6, so next is Agent 4 (60)

This allocation allows each agent to receive an item they value relatively highly, reducing potential envy. Let's assign the items according to this plan:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items and attempts to fairly distribute them based on the highest individual valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible.
