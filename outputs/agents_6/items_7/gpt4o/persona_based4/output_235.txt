Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  32  86  98  72  44  57
1  88   4  39  94  51  82  60
2  28  20  20  30  88   8  86
3   9  42  24  97  92  17  21
4  62  57  49  47  62   3  41
5   1   2  47   9  84  58  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free distribution where possible, taking into consideration the agents' valuations. Given the data, we have 6 agents and 7 items to allocate. Let's try to distribute these items so that the total perceived value is balanced across agents, thereby minimizing envy.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Highest Valuation Assignment:** Start by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most.
2. **Balancing Values:** Adjust allocations to ensure that no agent feels significantly envious of others, keeping in mind that each agent should ideally get at least one item (given there are 7 items and 6 agents).

### Step-by-step Allocation:
- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (88).
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (32).
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (86).
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (98).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (88).
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (82).
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (86).

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]

Agents 3, 4, and 5 haven't been allocated any items yet. Let's consider reallocating some items to ensure every agent receives at least one item.

### Redistribution for Balance:
1. Reassign item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 3.
2. Reassign item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 4.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 5 (from Agent 0).

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive at least one item, with an attempt to balance perceived values based on initial valuations, thereby aiming for an envy-free distribution.
