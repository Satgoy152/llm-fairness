Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  37  17  40  77  89   1
1  61  64  62  11  59  34  29
2  35  53   1  64  40  13  50
3  27  70  92  95  20  41  16
4  99  86  88  48  65  26  74
5  68   8  28  53   8  39  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents according to their valuations, we aim for a method that minimizes envy among the agents. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation method, though achieving perfect envy-freeness can be difficult, especially with integer allocations and a small number of items relative to agents. In this case, we have 6 agents and 7 items.

Here's one possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while trying to minimize overall envy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 5 (value 89). No other agent values this item as highly as agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 0 (value 61). Agent 4 also values item 0 highly, but we will assign it to agent 1 because agent 4 has other high-value options.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 3 (value 64) the most, which is also the highest valuation of item 3 among all agents.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 (value 92) the highest among all agents.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 1 (value 86) very highly, which is also the highest valuation for item 1.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent highly values item 6 (value 99), which is the highest valuation among all agents for this item.

After allocating these items based on the highest bids, we are left with item 4. To determine the best allocation, consider the remaining agents and their valuations for item 4:

- Agent 0: 77
- Agent 1: 59
- Agent 2: 40
- Agent 3: 20
- Agent 4: 65
- Agent 5: 8

Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 among those not yet maximally satisfied, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to align with each agent's highest-valued item to minimize envy.
