Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  89  13  17  62  75  49
1   4  66  25   5  41  64  67
2  35  59  21  89   8  88  89
3  71  50  66   9  43  28  22
4  62  20   8  68  78   9  11
5  70   1  21  48  90  14  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they are receiving the best possible allocation given the constraints. We will use the following approach:

1. **Calculate total valuations**: Sum the valuations for each item across all agents.
2. **Allocate items based on highest valuation**: Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item**: If any agent does not receive an item, we will make adjustments by reallocating items with the least impact on overall valuations.

Now, let's perform the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 71 by agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 89 by agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 66 by agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 89 by agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 90 by agent 5.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 88 by agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is 90 by agent 5.

After this initial allocation, the distribution is as follows:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [3, 5]
- Agent 3: [0, 2]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [4, 6]

We notice that agents 1 and 4 have no items. We need to make some reallocations to ensure that each agent has at least one item. Let's consider reallocating the least valued items for agents with multiple items:

- **Reallocate Item 2 from agent 3 to agent 1** (since it has the lowest value for agent 3 among 0 and 2).
- **Reallocate Item 6 from agent 5 to agent 4** (since it has the same value as item 4, but reallocating item 4 would cause agent 5 to lose all items).

Now, the revised allocation is:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3, 5]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [6]
- Agent 5: [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes individual valuations under the constraints.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4]
}
```
