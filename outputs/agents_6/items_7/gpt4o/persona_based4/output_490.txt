Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  53  61  10  43  97  11
1  22  93  23  19  20  38  83
2  78  39  55  14  27  84  91
3  48  37  89  86  23  92   8
4  66  88  58  13   9  69  55
5  79  19  10  93  92  51  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should prefer their own bundle of items over any other agent's bundle, based on their valuations.

One common approach is the "adjusted winner" procedure or similar methods, but given the need for a quick solution, I'll use a heuristic method that tries to balance the total value each agent gets. We'll aim for each agent to get approximately equal total value according to their own valuations.

Here are the steps to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Use a greedy algorithm to distribute items, giving each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Review allocations and adjust if necessary to ensure that no agent receives more items than others, if fairness in the number of items is also a priority.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 67 + 53 + 61 + 10 + 43 + 97 + 11 = 342
   - Agent 1: 22 + 93 + 23 + 19 + 20 + 38 + 83 = 298
   - Agent 2: 78 + 39 + 55 + 14 + 27 + 84 + 91 = 388
   - Agent 3: 48 + 37 + 89 + 86 + 23 + 92 + 8 = 383
   - Agent 4: 66 + 88 + 58 + 13 + 9 + 69 + 55 = 358
   - Agent 5: 79 + 19 + 10 + 93 + 92 + 51 + 87 = 431

2. Allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

   - Item 0: Agent 5 values it the most at 79.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 93.
   - Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 89.
   - Item 3: Agent 5 values it the most at 93.
   - Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most at 92.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.

3. Ensure no agent gets more items than others if possible, and that all items are allocated. The initial allocation results in a fair distribution by item value primarily, but let's ensure at least an item is given to each agent:

   - Agent 0: [5]
   - Agent 1: [1]
   - Agent 2: [6]
   - Agent 3: [2]
   - Agent 4: []
   - Agent 5: [0, 3, 4]

4. Adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

   - Move item 3 (valued at 13 by Agent 4) from Agent 5 to Agent 4.

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the highest individual valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and maintains a fairness in terms of the number of items.
