Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  62  73  72  73  37  60
1   6  62  35  51  92  11  43
2  69  56  88  46  74  76  16
3  21  83  38  56  90  27  11
4  82  37  88  54  84  82   5
5  14  86  38  60  92  16  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common method for fair division is to use algorithms like the round-robin or maximum Nash welfare approaches. However, given the constraints and the need for a simple integer allocation, we'll use a heuristic approach to ensure fairness and distribute the items effectively.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  62  73  72  73  37  60
1   6  62  35  51  92  11  43
2  69  56  88  46  74  76  16
3  21  83  38  56  90  27  11
4  82  37  88  54  84  82   5
5  14  86  38  60  92  16  23
```

We need to allocate the 7 items (0 through 6) to 6 agents (0 through 5) such that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 4** is highly valued by multiple agents, especially agent 1 and agent 5. To break the tie, let's give it to agent 1, who has a stronger preference overall.
   
2. **Item 0** is highly valued by agent 0 and agent 4. To ensure agent 0 gets a valuable item early, allocate item 0 to agent 0.

3. **Item 2** is highly valued by agents 2 and 4. Allocating it to agent 2 maximizes their satisfaction early on.

4. **Item 1** is most valued by agent 5, so allocate it to agent 5.

5. **Item 3** is valued by agent 0 and agent 5, but agent 0 has already received an item. Assign it to agent 5 to balance their allocation.

6. **Item 5** is valued by agent 2, who has already received an item. The next best valuation is agent 4, so allocate it to agent 4.

7. **Item 6** is not highly valued by any agent, but it can be allocated to agent 3, who hasn't yet received an item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, except for agent 3, who ends up with the least valued item due to the constraints.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair and envy-free as possible given the constraints, ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives items based on their valuations.
