Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  60  85  37   6  90  11
1  66  56  83   9  32  24  67
2  96  76  99  32  23  16  23
3  25  65   3  93  75  21  82
4  50  40  53  47  90   5  55
5  26  12  66  46  36  78   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents that minimizes envy, we'll aim for an allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction according to their individual valuations of the items. We'll use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare or finding an allocation such that each agent's valuation of their bundle is as high as possible while maintaining fairness.

Given there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the others will receive one item each. The goal is to make the allocations such that envy is minimized.

Let's proceed with distributing the items:

1. **Highest Valuation Assignment**: Initially assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

2. **Iterative Adjustments**: Adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item, while minimizing envy.

Using these principles, we can derive an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuation item is 5 (value 90).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation item is 0 (value 66).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation item is 2 (value 99).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuation item is 3 (value 93).
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuation item is 4 (value 90).
- **Agent 5**: Highest valuation item is 1 (value 12).

Now, we allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 66).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 5 (value 12).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 99).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 93).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value 90).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 90).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 23, second highest valuation for this item).

Now the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item, with Agent 2 getting two items due to their relatively high valuations for those items.
