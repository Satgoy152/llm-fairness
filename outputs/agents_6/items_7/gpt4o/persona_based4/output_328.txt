Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  20  77  37  39  41  52
1  35   7  32  96   7  62  94
2  83  48  31   8  41  76  52
3  80   7  60   7  27  72  59
4  93  62  77  83  96  59  46
5  66  88  90  42  66  32  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, let's try to allocate the items so that each agent gets the maximum possible value according to their preferences. Here is one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 highly, but it's already considered for Agent 0. Let's try item 5.
4. **Agent 3** has a decent valuation for item 5, but item 6 is moderately valued by them as well.
5. **Agent 4** values items 4 and 3 highly.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 highly, but it's already considered for Agent 0, so let's try item 1.

Let's assign the items based on the above observations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 6
- **Agent 4**: Item 4
- **Agent 5**: Item 1

This allocation is an attempt to satisfy the preferences of each agent based on their highest valuations for the available items. Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
