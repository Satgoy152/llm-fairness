Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  81  73  59  73  96  36
1  51  35  80  23  67  29  99
2  70  72  85  52  68  19  59
3  10  17  62  58  78   4  44
4  73  13  96  73  97  41  53
5  32  56  22  60  63  67  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible. Given the constraints, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent has a better allocation. Here is a proposed allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Items 5 (96) and 3 (59)
2. **Agent 1:** Items 6 (99)
3. **Agent 2:** Items 2 (85)
4. **Agent 3:** Items 4 (78)
5. **Agent 4:** Items 1 (13)
6. **Agent 5:** Items 0 (32)

Let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Total value = 96 + 59 = 155
- Agent 1: Total value = 99
- Agent 2: Total value = 85
- Agent 3: Total value = 78
- Agent 4: Total value = 13
- Agent 5: Total value = 32

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while assigning exactly 7 items. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible due to the limited number of items and the varying preferences of each agent, but this allocation seeks to balance the distribution.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
