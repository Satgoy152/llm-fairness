Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  50  59  99  95  25  94
1   4  88  46   9  48  21  20
2  32  45   4  77  87   7  20
3  37  79   2  64  88  50  56
4  96   3  99  20  46  87  34
5  63  11  11  90  15  10  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness. One approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method, which maximizes the product of the agents' utilities and often results in an envy-free allocation.

Given the agents' valuations, we can proceed with a fair allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0** has high value for item 3 and item 0, so they should get item 3.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly, so they are allocated that item.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly, so they are allocated that item.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 highly, but since it's already allocated, their next best is item 4, which is also taken, so they receive item 5.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 2, so they receive it.
6. **Agent 5** values item 6 highly, so they receive it. For item 0, though Agent 5 doesn't value it as high as Agent 0, we can allocate item 0 as it's unallocated, ensuring the number of items matches the constraint.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, maximizing individual satisfaction and overall fairness.

The final allocation is as follows:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6]
}
```
This allocation considers each agent's preferences, ensuring a fair distribution of the items among the agents.
