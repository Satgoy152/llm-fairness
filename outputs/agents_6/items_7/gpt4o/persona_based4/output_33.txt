Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  27  43  18  12  16  71
1  44  25  26   4  27  88  90
2  49  22  84  98  14  23  50
3  42   2  90  34  56  26  65
4  22  17   6  99   0  95  49
5  59  22  88  77  21  76  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure a fair distribution in terms of perceived value. Here's one approach to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** 
   Each agent has different valuations for the items. We begin by identifying which items hold the highest value for each agent.

2. **Allocate Based on Preferences:** 
   We can make allocations by attempting to satisfy the highest value items for each agent wherever possible, and then adjust to balance the allocation.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** 
   Ensure that no agent envies another by considering reallocations or adjustments.

Now, let's determine an allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (71).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (90), but it is already taken by Agent 0. The next highest is item 5 (88).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (98).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (90).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (99), but it is already taken by Agent 2. The next highest is item 5 (95).
- Agent 5 values item 2 the most (88), but it is already taken by Agent 3. The next highest is item 6 (88), but it is taken by Agent 0. Next is item 0 (59).

Given these preferences, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [0, 1]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is based on their highest preferences while minimizing envy as much as possible.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```
