Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  64  91  75  22  78  83
1  15  57   6  78  47  57   0
2  37  21  76  93  49  36  28
3   9  36  14  95  34   3  71
4  67  51   9  59  94  13  71
5   2  16  40  26  60  54  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: \(35 + 64 + 91 + 75 + 22 + 78 + 83 = 448\)
   - Agent 1: \(15 + 57 + 6 + 78 + 47 + 57 + 0 = 260\)
   - Agent 2: \(37 + 21 + 76 + 93 + 49 + 36 + 28 = 340\)
   - Agent 3: \(9 + 36 + 14 + 95 + 34 + 3 + 71 = 262\)
   - Agent 4: \(67 + 51 + 9 + 59 + 94 + 13 + 71 = 364\)
   - Agent 5: \(2 + 16 + 40 + 26 + 60 + 54 + 48 = 246\)

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Individual Satisfaction:**
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each item is allocated exactly once.

3. **Fair Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values items 2 and 6 highly. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most, but it's already taken, so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most, but it's already taken, so assign item 6 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 4 values item 4 the most. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
   - Agent 5 values item 4 the most, but it's already taken, so assign item 5 to Agent 5.
   - Now, assign the remaining item, item 1, to an agent that can benefit from it, such as Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize satisfaction based on initial valuations while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items.
