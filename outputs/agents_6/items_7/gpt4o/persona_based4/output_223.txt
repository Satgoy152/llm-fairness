Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  12  73  54  88  86  34
1  64  67  59  88  58  14   5
2  52  17  97   4  43  93  24
3  79  85  49   3  73  75   8
4  28  34  92  62  34  42  13
5  19   8  43  10  79  42  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while addressing envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Here, I'll use an approach that seeks to maximize the minimum envy or balance the allocation based on preferences.

First, let's summarize the total valuation of each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: \(41 + 12 + 73 + 54 + 88 + 86 + 34 = 388\)
- Agent 1: \(64 + 67 + 59 + 88 + 58 + 14 + 5 = 355\)
- Agent 2: \(52 + 17 + 97 + 4 + 43 + 93 + 24 = 330\)
- Agent 3: \(79 + 85 + 49 + 3 + 73 + 75 + 8 = 372\)
- Agent 4: \(28 + 34 + 92 + 62 + 34 + 42 + 13 = 305\)
- Agent 5: \(19 + 8 + 43 + 10 + 79 + 42 + 16 = 217\)

Next, let's allocate the items to maximize fairness by addressing the highest-valued items for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

1. Allocate items to agents based on their highest preference:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (88)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (88)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (97)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (85)
   - Agent 4: Item 0 (28)
   - Agent 5: Item 5 (79)

Now, only one item (6) remains unallocated. We will assign it based on the next highest preference not yet allocated:

- Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 24, which is the highest remaining unallocated item value for Agent 2.

The allocations would then be:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Item 5

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```
