Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  18  54  72  22   8  93
1  10  19  10  23  96  15   9
2  12  46  91  35  15  62  88
3  72  88  80  74  26  79  30
4  63  93  20  15  47  49  20
5  18  32   4  38  84  89  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the principles of fair division, such as envy-freeness and maximizing the total valuation for each agent as much as possible. We will attempt to allocate the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's first consider the valuations for each item by each agent. Our goal is to allocate items in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's happiness with their allocation based on their individual valuations.

Here is one possible allocation that aims to satisfy these criteria:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most (93), so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most (96), so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (91), so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most (88), so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most, but since it is already allocated, we consider their next highest valuation, which is item 0 (63), so we allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 5 the most (89), so we allocate item 5 to agent 5.
7. Agent 5 also highly values item 3 (38) compared to other unallocated items, and since they have only one item, we allocate item 3 to agent 5.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest available valuations, while also distributing the items fairly among all agents.
