Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  21  29   7  34  10  99
1  11  30  12  74  90  43  49
2  30  30  41  12  62   5  86
3   3   2  57  35  45  33   9
4  58  43  99   1  35  68  65
5  70  19  87  63  91  59   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuation and allocate items to maximize their satisfaction. The goal is to distribute all 7 items among the 6 agents in a way that each agent is satisfied according to their valuation.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 6, so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 6, but since it's already allocated, we look at their next highest value, which is item 0. However, item 0 is more valuable to agent 0. Therefore, we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2, but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 3, which is their next highest value.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 2, but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 0, which is also highly valued by them.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 4, but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 5, which is their next highest value.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items. Since item 1 is the only one left unallocated, we find the best fit for it:
- Agent 0 has the highest remaining value for item 1 compared to other agents with available allocations. Therefore, we allocate item 1 to agent 0.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item (except agent 1), and the allocation is as fair as possible given their valuations.
