Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  87  21  65  52  38  14
1  73   4  37  41  31  99   6
2  49  46  86  24  20  16   9
3  27  92  22  26  62  27  62
4  29  95  77  56   0  70  17
5  24  24  91  71   6  24  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure that the allocation is envy-free, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to make sure each agent feels they received the best possible set of items given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying which items each agent values the most. This will help in prioritizing allocations to minimize envy.

2. **Allocate High-Valued Items**: Assign items to agents who value them the highest, ensuring no conflicts where possible.

3. **Balance the Remaining Items**: After assigning the highest-valued items, distribute the remaining items to balance the allocations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's assign the items based on the given matrix:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (87) and item 0 (73).
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly (99).
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (86).
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly (92).
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (95).
- Agent 5 values item 2 highly (91).

Given these preferences, we try to distribute the items as fairly as possible:

1. **Assign items with highest unique valuation**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets item 5.
   - Agent 2 gets item 2.

2. **Resolve conflicts and balance allocations**:
   - Agent 3 and Agent 4 have high valuations for item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 4 since Agent 4 values it slightly more.
   - Agent 3 can be given item 4, which has a decent valuation (62).
   - Agent 5, having missed item 2, can receive item 3.

3. **Distribute remaining item(s)**:
   - The remaining item is item 6, which can be given to Agent 3, as it fits with their remaining preference.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to minimize envy based on the highest valuation preferences.
