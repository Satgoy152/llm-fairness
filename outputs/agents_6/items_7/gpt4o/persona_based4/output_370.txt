Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  89   2  38  36   4  16
1  95  77  79  66  41  12  96
2  57  34  30  29  16  47  27
3  84  40  30  49   6  39  44
4  90  82  27  75   5  56  47
5  10  97  38  49  65  77  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents, I will use the "Envy-Free" concept to distribute the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
   - Identify the highest valued item for each agent to maximize individual happiness.
   - Attempt to distribute items so that each agent gets an item they highly value based on the given table.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Focus on assigning the most valued items first to each agent.
   - Ensure that no agent ends up envious of another agent's allocation by comparing their current allocations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuations:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (89).
- **Agent 1** values item 6 the most (96).
- **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (57).
- **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (84), but since item 0 is already allocated, the next best is item 3 (49).
- **Agent 4** values item 0 the most (90), but since item 0 is already allocated, the next best is item 1 (82).
- **Agent 5** values item 1 the most (97), but since item 1 is already allocated, the next best is item 5 (77).

After these allocations, we must ensure all items are distributed:

- **Item 2** and **Item 4** remain unallocated, so we need to assign them to agents with fewer items or lower total value.

Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item they value relatively highly, with minimal envy, while all items are distributed.
