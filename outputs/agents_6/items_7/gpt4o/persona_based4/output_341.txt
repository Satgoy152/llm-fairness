Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  90  94   9  68  41  40
1  88  63  88  84   0  63  75
2  67  95  10  93  31  63   4
3   8  20  44  14  51  98  39
4   3  27  85  84  89  61  60
5  65  22  11   6  70  92  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive, while keeping their allocations as balanced as possible. Given that we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive more items than the others, which is unavoidable. Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is Item 2 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is Item 0 (value 88).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is Item 1 (value 95).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is Item 5 (value 98).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is Item 4 (value 89).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value item for Agent 5 is Item 6 (value 93).

This allocation covers 6 items, and each agent has received their highest valued item. We have one item remaining (Item 3). We need to allocate this item to one of the agents who will have two items in total.

Agent 2 values Item 3 the highest among those who have not been fully satisfied with their single item allocation, with a valuation of 93.

So, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent the item they value the most, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
