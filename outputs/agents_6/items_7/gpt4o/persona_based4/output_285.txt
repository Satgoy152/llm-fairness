Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  26  21  46  23   3  24
1   7  25  85  88  14  54  53
2  37  59   6  66  36  83  52
3  53  64  98  71  26  80  34
4   5  76  17  11   3  25  77
5  22  93  69  82  30  61  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their perceived value while trying to minimize envy among agents. The challenge here is to allocate exactly 7 items among 6 agents, which means one agent may not receive any items.

First, let's analyze the valuations to find a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for item 0 (84) and item 3 (46).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for item 3 (88) and item 2 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for item 5 (83) and item 3 (66).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for item 2 (98) and item 5 (80).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for item 1 (76) and item 6 (77).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest values are for item 1 (93) and item 3 (82).

Considering these valuations, we aim to allocate items such that each agent gets their highest valued items where possible:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (84), maximizing their valuation.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (88) and item 2 (85), which are their top two choices.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (83), which is their highest valuation.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 2 (98), their highest value item, but since it is already assigned, assign item 5 (80), which is their next highest.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 6 (77), their highest available choice.
- **Agent 5**: Assign item 1 (93), their highest value item.

Agent 3 does not receive any items as their highest valued items are already allocated to other agents. This ensures that each agent receives their most valued available items, minimizing envy.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1]
}
```
