Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  24  25   8  60  18  78
1  50  58  24  57  12  90  35
2  10  86  74  12  46  53  25
3  91  87  36  26  63  48  10
4  48  36  58  97   4  53  15
5  92  39  45  67   7  35  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the six agents, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. We will use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

We have 7 items to allocate among 6 agents, which means one agent will receive 2 items and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Let's evaluate the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the highest (78).
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (90).
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest (86).
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest (91).
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest (97).
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 the highest (92).

To ensure fairness, we should consider how the allocations affect the overall distribution. Let's start allocating based on the highest valuation for each agent:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (but note that Agent 5 also values 0 highly, so we will need to balance).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 5.

Now, Agent 3 and Agent 5 both value item 0 highly. To balance this:

Let's try to allocate the remaining items considering both agents' preferences:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as they have a relatively high value for it.

Now let's finalize the allocations:

- Agent 0: [4, 6]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [2]

This results in:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by distributing the items based on each agent's highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item they value highly.
