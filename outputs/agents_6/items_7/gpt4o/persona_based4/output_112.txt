Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  11   2  29  90   2  63
1  54  38  64  31   7  78  64
2  35  84   3  90  27  71  51
3  81  65  13  15  96  67  68
4  90  57  43  90  21  46  36
5  44  84  25  86  93  40   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [44 84 25 86 93 40  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible given the valuations. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations provided, let's first examine the total valuation each agent has for all items to guide the allocation process:

- Agent 0: 278
- Agent 1: 336
- Agent 2: 361
- Agent 3: 405
- Agent 4: 383
- Agent 5: 380

Next, we'll use an approach to allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, while trying to keep the overall distribution as balanced as possible in terms of total value.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (most valuable item for Agent 3).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (most valuable item for Agent 2).
3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 5 (second most valuable item for Agent 5).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (most valuable item for Agent 0).
5. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (tied for most valuable for Agent 1).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4 (second most valuable item for Agent 4).
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (second most valuable item for Agent 1).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them an item they value highly, while distributing the total value as evenly as possible.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```
