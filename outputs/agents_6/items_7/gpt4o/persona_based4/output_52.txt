Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  72  47  21   2  70  86
1  29   2  86   2  12  11  69
2  24  38  75  72  72  93  45
3  97   5  45   0  47  30   6
4  33  11  21  93  61  33  30
5  78  46  17  46  71   4  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an algorithm that aims to satisfy envy-freeness, if possible, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Assign items based on highest value**: Start assigning items to agents by selecting the item each agent values the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and that no item is assigned to more than one agent.

2. **Iterate over remaining items**: Once each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining items to the agents based on maximizing the total value for each agent or minimizing envy.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value: 97)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value: 72)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value: 86)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (value: 93)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5 (value: 71)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value: 93)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value: 86)

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, with Agent 0 receiving two items and the other agents receiving one item each.
