Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  23  98  81  53  54  35
1  52  33  23   8  86  42  26
2  60  79  74  73  99  95  73
3  16   9  13  48  67  85  51
4  73  18  52  47  91  59  65
5  37   4  40  15  89  99  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. One approach to achieve this is to look at the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that the sum of values each agent receives is balanced, or as close as possible, across all agents.

Let's first sum up the total valuations for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: 26 + 23 + 98 + 81 + 53 + 54 + 35 = 370
- Agent 1: 52 + 33 + 23 + 8 + 86 + 42 + 26 = 270
- Agent 2: 60 + 79 + 74 + 73 + 99 + 95 + 73 = 553
- Agent 3: 16 + 9 + 13 + 48 + 67 + 85 + 51 = 289
- Agent 4: 73 + 18 + 52 + 47 + 91 + 59 + 65 = 405
- Agent 5: 37 + 4 + 40 + 15 + 89 + 99 + 22 = 306

Next, we can try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share. We'll aim to give agents items they value highly while keeping the total value received by each agent balanced.

After evaluating the values, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```
