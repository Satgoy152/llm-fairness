Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  51   9  56  18  75  18
1  74  54  23  93  67  89  96
2   9  90  85  56  55  76  81
3  16  95  54   9  52   6   3
4  38  84  34  13   7  20   9
5  33  66   6  19  17  88  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One way to approach this problem is to use a method called the "maximum envy-free allocation," which attempts to allocate items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation more than their own.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation for item 0 (96). Give item 0 to agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuation for item 6 (96). Give item 6 to agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuation for item 1 (90). Give item 1 to agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuation for item 2 (54). Give item 2 to agent 3.
   
5. **Agent 4**:
   - High valuation for item 4 (7), which is not the highest but no other unallocated item has a higher valuation from another agent. Give item 4 to agent 4.
   
6. **Agent 5**:
   - High valuation for item 5 (88). Give item 5 to agent 5.
   
Now, we have one item left, item 3. We look at the remaining item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most among those who have not yet reached their highest value allocation. 

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (93). We can give item 3 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures each item is allocated and attempts to respect the highest individual valuations where possible. It is important to note that achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible in certain configurations, but this allocation minimizes potential envy by focusing on high valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```
