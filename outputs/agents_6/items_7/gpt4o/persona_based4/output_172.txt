Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  62  68  43  68  71  74
1  96  43   3  55  13  58  69
2  41  96  72  46  13  47  77
3  90  93   3  80  97  97  91
4  39  82  88  59  58  27  79
5   3  74  44  74   7  83  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an algorithm that seeks to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a procedure similar to the "maximum weighted matching" in graph theory, where agents are vertices and edges connect them to items with weights corresponding to their valuations.

Here's an attempt at allocating items fairly:

1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent and try to assign that item if no conflicts arise.
2. If conflicts arise (i.e., multiple agents want the same item), resolve them by considering next highest values until all items are allocated.
3. Ensure each agent's allocation is as close to their preference as possible, aiming for envy-freeness.

Applying this strategy to the table:

- Agent 0 has high values on item 6.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most.

Allocating based on these preferences and resolving conflicts:

- Assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to agent 4.
- Assign item 5 to agent 5.

Now, we have one item left to allocate (item 3), which we can assign to the agent with the highest remaining valuation:

- Assign item 3 to agent 3 (since agent 3 has the highest remaining valuation for item 3).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5]
}
```
