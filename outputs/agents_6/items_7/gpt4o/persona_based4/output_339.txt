Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22   8  80  49  63  15   2
1  25  10  80  80  99  98  59
2  92  86  38  63  19  56  55
3  13   4  49   5  89  95  41
4  34  16  63   6   7  74  73
5  64  89  38  96  93  29  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we'll aim to give each agent items that maximize their perceived value. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item. We'll try to distribute them such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Here's a potential allocation based on maximizing each agent's total value while trying to maintain balance:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 2 (value 80).
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 4 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most (value 92).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the most (value 95).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 the most, but it's taken; next highest is item 6 (value 73).
6. **Agent 5**: Prefers item 3 (value 96), and as agent 4 is given item 6, agent 5 can take item 1 (value 89).

Given this preference order and ensuring that each item is assigned, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives according to their preferences, while ensuring all items are distributed.
