Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  80  16  98  14  57   8
1   7  37  75  25  38  56  77
2  91  57  81  54  64  48  28
3  87  94  84  66  45  41  59
4  67  10   5  16  51  76  30
5  65  74  23  16  72  36   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this allocation problem, we need to ensure that the allocation is fair, particularly in terms of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of items assigned to another agent over their own allocation. Given this, we will evaluate the valuations provided by each agent for the items and try to allocate them in a way that minimizes envy.

The first step is to calculate the total value each agent gives to all items and consider how we can distribute the items to maintain fairness. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Valuations: [53, 80, 16, 98, 14, 57, 8]
   - Assign item 3 (98), as it is their highest valued item.
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Valuations: [7, 37, 75, 25, 38, 56, 77]
   - Assign item 2 (75) and item 6 (77), maximizing their value.

3. Agent 2:
   - Valuations: [91, 57, 81, 54, 64, 48, 28]
   - Assign item 0 (91), which is their highest valued item.

4. Agent 3:
   - Valuations: [87, 94, 84, 66, 45, 41, 59]
   - Assign item 1 (94), as it is their highest valued item.
   
5. Agent 4:
   - Valuations: [67, 10, 5, 16, 51, 76, 30]
   - Assign item 5 (76), which is their highest valued item.

6. Agent 5:
   - Valuations: [65, 74, 23, 16, 72, 36, 8]
   - Assign item 4 (72), which is their highest valued item.

This allocation ensures that each agent is getting at least one item that they highly value, reducing the chances of envy between agents. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

The allocation assigns all 7 items, and each agent is allocated items in a way that prioritizes their highest valuations, attempting to achieve envy-freeness.
