Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  44  79  38  55  78  90
1  72  24   0  75  91  62  91
2  69  78  24  26  82  88  71
3  49  61  90  81  29   8  66
4  42  74  70  11  53  10  42
5  12  41  41  41   3   7  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the agents' valuations and consider a strategy to divide the items:

1. Start by assigning items to the agent who values them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to minimize any envy.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most, so assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most, so assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most, so assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most, so assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 has low valuations, so assign item 0 to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items, with one remaining (item 3). Let's assign it to agent 3, who has a high valuation for it.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an item based on their preferences, aiming to minimize envy.
