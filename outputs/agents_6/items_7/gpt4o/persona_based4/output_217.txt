Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  29  99  91  71   9  30
1  75   1  63  25  98  78  52
2  38  41  13  90  76  69  26
3  51  93  94  42  64   6  35
4  78  38  45  59  13  85  19
5  30  33   0  72  48  86  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items to agents in a fair manner, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as the bundles assigned to other agents. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and only the 7 items are available, let's proceed with the allocation.

First, let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents based on maximizing their utility while ensuring no envy among other agents.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 17 + 29 + 99 + 91 + 71 + 9 + 30 = 346
- Agent 1: 75 + 1 + 63 + 25 + 98 + 78 + 52 = 392
- Agent 2: 38 + 41 + 13 + 90 + 76 + 69 + 26 = 353
- Agent 3: 51 + 93 + 94 + 42 + 64 + 6 + 35 = 385
- Agent 4: 78 + 38 + 45 + 59 + 13 + 85 + 19 = 337
- Agent 5: 30 + 33 + 0 + 72 + 48 + 86 + 21 = 290

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the value that each agent receives while ensuring no envy. One approach is to allocate the most valued item to each agent first, then allocate the remaining items to minimize envy.

Considering the highest valued items for each agent:
- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (99).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (98).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (90).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (93).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (78).
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most (86).

Allocate these items first:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Agent 5: Item 5

We have one item remaining, item 6. Let's allocate it to the agent who values it the most among those who have already received an item:
- Agent 1 values item 6 at 52, the highest among all agents.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (or as many as possible in a fair manner), and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
