Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  72  39  67  79  22  95
1  90  78  46   1  23  61  71
2  47  73  43   3  41  69  44
3  39  81  32  26  51  98  33
4  54  53  86  62   7  97  52
5  42  41   5  87  34  96  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a balance where no agent envies another, considering their valuations. One common approach is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or other fair division algorithms, but since we're handling integers and a small number of items, a heuristic approach can work well.

Below is a suggested allocation that attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocated items [0, 6]. Valuation: 44 (item 0) + 95 (item 6) = 139.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocated item [1]. Valuation: 78 (item 1) = 78.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocated item [2]. Valuation: 43 (item 2) = 43.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocated items [3, 5]. Valuation: 26 (item 3) + 98 (item 5) = 124.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocated item [4]. Valuation: 7 (item 4) = 7.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocated no items. Valuation: 0.

This allocation does not perfectly balance valuations, but it ensures that all items are allocated and tries to respect the preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": []
}
```
