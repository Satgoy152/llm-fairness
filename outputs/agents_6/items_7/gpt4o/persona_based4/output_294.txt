Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  61  77  97  65  16   1
1   7  89   9  39  42  38  54
2  72   1  61  30  64  51  54
3  63  65  44  43  71  19  79
4  98  80  71  75  44  43  18
5  60  21  14   8  78  30  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation while considering envy-freeness, we can use the maximin share concept, which aims to maximize the minimum value each agent can be guaranteed in a fair allocation. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will have to receive more than one item. We want to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy among agents by ensuring that each receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's calculate a possible fair division of items among agents:

- **Agent 0**: Prefers items with higher values. The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (97). 
- **Agent 1**: The highest value is item 1 (89).
- **Agent 2**: The highest value is item 0 (72).
- **Agent 3**: The highest value is item 6 (79).
- **Agent 4**: The highest value is item 0 (98), but it's already taken, so the next highest is item 3 (75).
- **Agent 5**: The highest value is item 4 (78).

Given these preferences and keeping envy-freeness in mind, we can try to allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 3
2. **Agent 1**: Item 1
3. **Agent 2**: Item 0
4. **Agent 3**: Item 6
5. **Agent 4**: Items 5 (43) and 2 (71) (since their highest preference is taken, distribute remaining based on their next highest preferences)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to a strategy that maximizes their satisfaction while minimizing envy. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 2],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring that all 7 items are allocated.
