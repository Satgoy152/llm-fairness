Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  68  14  55  15  13  21
1  77  82  71  83  64  21  47
2  59  51   1  43  48   5  56
3  38  74  65  97  68  11   4
4  61  58  15  75  82  77  36
5  44   9  35  19  81  87  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels they received an allocation that's at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations. Since we have 6 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We need to ensure that the allocations are as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Identify Key Preferences**: Start by identifying the highest value items for each agent.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items**: Allocate items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that no agent ends up with a significantly lower total value compared to others.

3. **Adjust to Balance**: After allocating high-value items, distribute the remaining items to balance the total value as evenly as possible across all agents.

Here's the allocation based on the strategy above:

- Agent 0 highly values item 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 3.
- Agent 2 highly values item 6.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3, but since Agent 1 values it slightly higher, Agent 3 can take item 1.
- Agent 4 highly values item 4.
- Agent 5 highly values item 5.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [1, 2]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [5]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one highly valued item, and the remaining item is distributed to minimize envy.
