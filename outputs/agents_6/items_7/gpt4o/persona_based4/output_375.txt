Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  93  14  61   1  43  83
1  19  97  67  75   2  79   8
2  20   2  83  70  22  14  71
3  12  27  81  19  59  12  26
4  59  14  66  26  54   8  30
5  96  72  50  85  26  65  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we will use a simple method that tries to balance the total value of items each agent receives. We aim to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives a reasonably fair share according to their valuations.

First, let's compute the sum of each agent's valuations for all items:

- Agent 0: 99 + 93 + 14 + 61 + 1 + 43 + 83 = 394
- Agent 1: 19 + 97 + 67 + 75 + 2 + 79 + 8 = 347
- Agent 2: 20 + 2 + 83 + 70 + 22 + 14 + 71 = 282
- Agent 3: 12 + 27 + 81 + 19 + 59 + 12 + 26 = 236
- Agent 4: 59 + 14 + 66 + 26 + 54 + 8 + 30 = 257
- Agent 5: 96 + 72 + 50 + 85 + 26 + 65 + 83 = 477

Now, let's attempt an initial allocation of items based on maximizing individual agent values and then adjust to balance total valuation:

1. Assign Agent 0 the highest value item for them: item 0 (value 99).
2. Assign Agent 1 the highest value item for them: item 1 (value 97).
3. Assign Agent 2 the highest value item for them: item 2 (value 83).
4. Assign Agent 3 the highest value item for them: item 2 (value 81), but item 2 is already assigned. Instead, assign item 4 (value 59).
5. Assign Agent 4 the highest value item for them: item 0 (value 59), but item 0 is already assigned. Instead, assign item 2 (value 66).
6. Assign Agent 5 the highest value item for them: item 0 (value 96), but item 0 is already assigned. Instead, assign item 3 (value 85).

Now we need to adjust and finalize allocations to ensure each agent gets some items and all items are allocated:

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0] (value 99)
- Agent 1: [1] (value 97)
- Agent 2: [2] (value 83)
- Agent 3: [6] (value 26)
- Agent 4: [4] (value 54)
- Agent 5: [3, 5] (values 85, 65)

This allocation attempts to balance total values received by each agent, given the constraints.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 5]
}
```
