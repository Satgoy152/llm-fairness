Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  40  88  53  41  59   0
1  36  84   3  94  99  59  18
2  73  71  14  98  62  18  46
3   7  91   1   6  60  29  95
4  64  81  72  80  89  93  86
5  24  10  10  85  27  82  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent gets, while ensuring no envy among agents. The aim is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share according to their valuation.

Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation for their allocated items is as high as possible, and ideally, no agent would prefer another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
           Items
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agents
0     60  40  88  53  41  59   0
1     36  84   3  94  99  59  18
2     73  71  14  98  62  18  46
3      7  91   1   6  60  29  95
4     64  81  72  80  89  93  86
5     24  10  10  85  27  82  37
```

To ensure fairness, we can try to allocate items based on the highest value each agent places on them, without overlap.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 2, which they value the most at 88.
- Agent 1 gets item 4, which they value the most at 99.
- Agent 2 gets item 3, which they value the most at 98.
- Agent 3 gets item 6, which they value the most at 95.
- Agent 4 gets item 5, which they value the most at 93.
- Agent 5 gets item 0, which they value relatively high at 24.
- As item 1 is not the highest value for any agent, we can allocate it to Agent 5 to balance the distribution, since they have the lowest remaining allocation.

Let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items with high personal value, and all items are distributed.
