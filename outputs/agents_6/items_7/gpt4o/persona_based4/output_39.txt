Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  99  12  17  82  31  74
1  65  49   7  51  77  33  55
2   0  67  57  12  70  71  68
3  45  46  45   6  85  45   7
4  43  47  19  65  55  55  17
5  73  68  27  11  68  76  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in such a way that the allocation is envy-free, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. Given the valuations, we can use a procedure that attempts to minimize envy by assigning items in a way that maximizes individual agents' valuations, while ensuring a roughly balanced distribution of items.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Create a preference list for each agent based on their valuations.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Begin by allocating each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no two agents are allocated the same item. If conflicts arise (multiple agents wanting the same most-valued item), prioritize based on the second-highest value item, and so on.

3. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - If two or more agents value the same item equally, use a tie-breaking rule, such as random allocation or the next highest valued item for one of the agents.

4. **Complete the Allocation:**
   - After initial allocations, assign the remaining items to the agents who value them the most among the unallocated items.

Following this approach, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most, but since agent 1 also highly values item 1, we assign agent 0 their next highest valued item.
- Agent 1 gets item 1 because it is their highest valued item and no higher competing preference exists.
- Continue this process to distribute all items.

After considering the valuations and resolving conflicts, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7, meeting the requirements.
