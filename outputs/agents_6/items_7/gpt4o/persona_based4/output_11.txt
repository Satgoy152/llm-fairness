Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  61  94  25  53  83  46
1  51   8  84  99   7  88  20
2  85   5  13  73  81   1  69
3  79  19   8  25  19  46  95
4  79  61  41  81   8  72   3
5  95  51   4  97  93  15  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, often referred to as the "max-min fair allocation." This means we want to allocate the items so that the least happy agent is as happy as possible, based on their valuations of the items. We also want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
2. Continue allocating remaining items to the agent who would gain the most value from them while maintaining fairness.

Following this approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most, so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most, so we assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most, so we assign item 6 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most, but it is already taken. The next highest value is item 0, but that is also taken, so we assign item 5 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most, but it is already taken. The next highest value is item 4, but that is also taken, so we assign item 1 to agent 5.

For the remaining items:
- Item 2 is valued the most by agent 0, so we assign it to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated while trying to maximize the fairness based on their valuations.
