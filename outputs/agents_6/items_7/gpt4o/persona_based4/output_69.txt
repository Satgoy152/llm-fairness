Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  11  69   6   2   5   2
1  47  62   1  46  86  94  26
2  10  75  75  83  55  27  29
3  65  83  49  49  40  40  87
4  24   4  90  91  88  54  91
5  69  21   4  61  45  99  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we'll use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent derives from their allocated items, while distributing the items as evenly as possible. Given the constraints, here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly, so let's allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high value for item 5, so we'll allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most, so item 3 will be allocated to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 highly, so we'll allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a high value for item 4, so we'll allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 highly, so we'll allocate item 0 to agent 5.
7. Finally, we have item 1 left. Since agent 3 values item 1 the most, we'll allocate item 1 to agent 3.

This allocation aims to distribute items such that each agent receives some of their higher-valued items, minimizing envy among agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 6 agents, with each agent receiving items in a way that attempts to maximize their individual valuations.
