Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  95  84   5  62  63  18
1  74  23  22  58  28  65  54
2  73  67  80  25  55  89  55
3  91  70  33  30  98  51  38
4  43   3  72  38  15  73  51
5  24  35  86   1  53  74  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while trying to minimize envy, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. The goal is to ensure each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuation of the items. 

Here's an approach to do this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and use this to guide the allocation.
2. Allocate items one by one, at each step assigning the item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't yet received an item.
3. Continue the process until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:**

   - Agent 0: 37 + 95 + 84 + 5 + 62 + 63 + 18 = 364
   - Agent 1: 74 + 23 + 22 + 58 + 28 + 65 + 54 = 324
   - Agent 2: 73 + 67 + 80 + 25 + 55 + 89 + 55 = 444
   - Agent 3: 91 + 70 + 33 + 30 + 98 + 51 + 38 = 411
   - Agent 4: 43 + 3 + 72 + 38 + 15 + 73 + 51 = 295
   - Agent 5: 24 + 35 + 86 + 1 + 53 + 74 + 49 = 322

2. **Allocate items based on the highest individual valuations:**

   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 3 (91)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (95)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 5 (86)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (58)
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 3 (98)
   - Item 5: Highest value by Agent 2 (89)
   - Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (18)

3. **Ensure that each agent gets at least one item and adjust allocations if necessary:**

   After the initial allocation based on the highest valuation, we check to ensure each agent has received at least one item. If any agent has not received an item, we adjust the allocation by considering the second-highest valuation for those items.

4. **Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item:**

   - Agent 0: [1, 6]
   - Agent 1: [3]
   - Agent 2: [5]
   - Agent 3: [0, 4]
   - Agent 4: [2]
   - Agent 5: []

   Since Agent 5 didnâ€™t receive any items, let's give them an item from an agent with more than one item. We can transfer item 6 from Agent 0 to Agent 5, as Agent 0 has two items.

5. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0: [1]
   - Agent 1: [3]
   - Agent 2: [5]
   - Agent 3: [0, 4]
   - Agent 4: [2]
   - Agent 5: [6]

Finally, here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6]
}
```
