Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  94  78  25  13  21  77
1  22  69  67  53  60  35  31
2  38  65  73  11  14   1  60
3  81  80  89  18  60  76  48
4  74   9  10  71  87  61   6
5  97  14  14  41  70  73  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given that we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each.

Let's start by finding a reasonable allocation considering the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 0 with 97. Thus, item 0 is allocated to Agent 5.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 1 with 94, the highest valuation for that item. So, item 1 is allocated to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 2 with 89. Therefore, item 2 is allocated to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4 with 87. Thus, item 4 is allocated to Agent 4.
5. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 with 53, which is the highest among remaining agents for unallocated items. So, item 3 is allocated to Agent 1.
6. **Agent 5** also values item 5 highly at 73 (after already receiving item 0). Allocating item 5 to Agent 5 balances their allocation and reflects their strong valuation for it.
7. **Agent 2** is left with item 6, where they have a valuation of 60, which is the highest among remaining choices for them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with Agent 5 receiving two items due to their strong valuations. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0, 5]
}
```
