Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  52  99  21  64  42  63
1  26  30  79  57  46  31  90
2  26  76  77  71  21  30  63
3  51  23  52  32  58  12  92
4  15  57  55  57  29  77  39
5   4  73  59  81  93  73  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives some benefit according to their individual valuations. Given the constraints and the need to allocate all 7 items, we can attempt a fair division approach, considering each agent's valuations.

**Steps for Allocation:**

1. **Identify High-Valuation Matches:** Start by identifying the highest-valued items for each agent. This can help ensure fairness by prioritizing allocations where agents have strong preferences.

2. **Distribute Items:** Assign items to maximize total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given there are 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will need to receive two items. We aim to allocate the second item to an agent who values it highly.

3. **Check for Envy:** After allocation, check if any agent would prefer another's allocation more than their own, and adjust if necessary to reduce envy.

Here's a possible allocation following these principles:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly, so assign item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly and is the only one who values it significantly, so assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highly, but agent 0 values it more, so allocate a different item to agent 3, such as item 4, which is less contentious.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly, so assign item 5 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 3 highly, so assign item 3 to agent 5.

Now, let's check if there's any remaining item or if we need to adjust:

- After allocation, item 2 remains unallocated. This item is highly valued by agent 0, who already has item 0, but it's also the next highest for agent 2.

Adjustments can be made to balance allocations, but here's a fair allocation based on initial preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide a fair distribution based on individual valuations and ensures all items are allocated. Agent 0 receives two items due to their high valuation for them, and adjustments are made to ensure fair distribution across other agents.
