Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  82  67  22  30  45  40
1  37  76  36  83  18  41  28
2  86  47  30  92  46  58  52
3  52  67  34  76  32  42  54
4  18  98  35  59  47   6  24
5  60  62  42  38   5  92   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents with the goal of minimizing envy and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method to distribute the items such that each agent's share approximates their proportional value as closely as possible.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(8 + 82 + 67 + 22 + 30 + 45 + 40 = 294\)
- Agent 1: \(37 + 76 + 36 + 83 + 18 + 41 + 28 = 319\)
- Agent 2: \(86 + 47 + 30 + 92 + 46 + 58 + 52 = 411\)
- Agent 3: \(52 + 67 + 34 + 76 + 32 + 42 + 54 = 357\)
- Agent 4: \(18 + 98 + 35 + 59 + 47 + 6 + 24 = 287\)
- Agent 5: \(60 + 62 + 42 + 38 + 5 + 92 + 7 = 306\)

The total value of all items as perceived by each agent is different due to subjective valuations. The challenge is to allocate 7 items among 6 agents so that the allocation is as fair as possible.

A possible heuristic is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each item is allocated exactly once. Let's allocate items with the goal of maximizing each agent's value from their assigned items.

1. Start by considering each agent's highest-valued items that have not yet been allocated.
2. Allocate those items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed.

Following these steps, a possible allocation could be as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 2 (67) and item 0 (8).
- Agent 1 receives item 3 (83).
- Agent 2 receives item 6 (52).
- Agent 3 receives item 1 (67).
- Agent 4 receives item 4 (47).
- Agent 5 receives item 5 (92).

These allocations are chosen to give each agent at least one item they value highly, ensuring the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the 6 agents, attempting to ensure each agent receives items that they highly value.
