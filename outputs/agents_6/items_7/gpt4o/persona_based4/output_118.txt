Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  73  87  60  46  29  75
1  61  55  78  45  33  21  69
2  66   8  13  47  41  25   9
3  49  13  60  34  63  86   7
4  60  72  66  47  68  65   3
5   9  42  63  33  79  63  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations and distribute the items in a manner that minimizes envy among agents. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints (an integer number of items per agent and a total of exactly 7 items), here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation for items 2 and 1.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest, but it's already allocated to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest.
6. **Agent 5** values item 4 the highest, but it's already allocated to Agent 4.

By considering these preferences and balancing the allocations, we can propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 2]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [6]

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated.

Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This proposal should ensure that each agent receives an allocation that they value, while also distributing all items.
