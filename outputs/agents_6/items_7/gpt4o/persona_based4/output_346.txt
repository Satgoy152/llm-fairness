Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  40  64  97   4  73  12
1  98  29   9  24  39  58  85
2  83  60  53  82  71  39  31
3  79  43  77  77  73  57  96
4  14  85  74  99  50  70  21
5  58   5  22  41  26  37  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to use an envy-free approach, attempting to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Given the constraints, we want to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step solution to achieve this:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Review each agent's valuation of items to identify which items are most valuable to each of them. 

2. **Consider top preferences**: Start by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations to minimize envy.

3. **Balance allocations**: Ensure that each agent gets a fair share, considering that each agent might not always get their top choice to ensure overall fairness. 

4. **Adjust to ensure all items are allocated**: If any items are left, allocate them to agents with the least total value initially or those who can benefit most from the additional item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 0 highly but can settle for item 3.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly but can settle for item 1.
- Agent 5 has relatively low valuations, but item 0 is a good option as it is not the highest for any other agent except 1.

After considering these, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3] (value 97)
- **Agent 1**: Items [0] (value 98)
- **Agent 2**: Items [4] (value 71)
- **Agent 3**: Items [6] (value 96)
- **Agent 4**: Items [1, 5] (value 85, 70)
- **Agent 5**: Items [2] (value 22)

This allocation maximizes individual satisfaction and balances the distribution fairly. Now, let's present it in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 5],
    "5": [2]
}
```
