Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  76  98  89  71  22  66
1  82   0  19  97   9  37  69
2   7  48  60  64  88  47   0
3  53  92  73  26  16  87  31
4  16  27  50   4  70   9  44
5   9  84   0  85  31   0  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to find a solution that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is as balanced as possible according to their valuations. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to get a sense of their overall preferences.
2. Assign items to agents to maximize their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. Check for envy-freeness and reallocate if necessary to reduce envy.

Let's analyze and allocate based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [30, 76, 98, 89, 71, 22, 66] - Total value = 452
- Agent 1: [82, 0, 19, 97, 9, 37, 69] - Total value = 313
- Agent 2: [7, 48, 60, 64, 88, 47, 0] - Total value = 314
- Agent 3: [53, 92, 73, 26, 16, 87, 31] - Total value = 378
- Agent 4: [16, 27, 50, 4, 70, 9, 44] - Total value = 220
- Agent 5: [9, 84, 0, 85, 31, 0, 57] - Total value = 266

Given the total values, we will allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (98) and item 3 (89). Assign item 2.
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (82) and item 3 (97). Assign item 3.
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (88). Assign item 4.
- Agent 3 highly values item 1 (92). Assign item 1.
- Agent 4 values are relatively low; assign item 5 for balancing.
- Agent 5 values items 1 and 3 highly, but since they are taken, assign item 6 and item 0 to balance the allocation.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6, 0]
}
```
