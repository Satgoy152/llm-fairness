Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  88  61  19  52  52  71
1  43  58  73  41  22  14  42
2  20  83  18  30  47  75  99
3  42  96  75  35  61  94  13
4  32  92   0  65  23  70  93
5  44  51  47  22  21  29  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation based on their valuations. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one item each.

Let's use the maximum sum of valuations to guide the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most (88).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (73).
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most (99).
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most (96). However, since item 1 is already allocated, we look for the next highest value, which is item 5 (94).
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 the most (93). However, since item 6 is already allocated, we look for the next highest value, which is item 1 (92).
6. **Agent 5** values item 0 the most (44).

Now, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item. Let's adjust the allocation to avoid envy:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [0]

Now we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate one more item. We will give this additional item to the agent who has the next highest value among the remaining items:

- Agent 0 also highly values item 0 (78), but itâ€™s taken by Agent 5, who has the least overall value. Agent 4 highly values item 3 (65), and this item is not yet allocated. We can give item 3 to Agent 4.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
