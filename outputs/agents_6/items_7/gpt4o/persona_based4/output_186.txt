Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  48  58  30  90  87  32
1  64  11  63   2  54  23  62
2  11  56  96  75   2  24  18
3  95  43  82  87  54  89  39
4  76  31  94  72  14  39  41
5  66  83  11  77  31   0   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly and that is comparable to what other agents receive. Given the valuations, we aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their individual preferences.

To start, we analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0         44  48  58  30  90  87  32
1         64  11  63   2  54  23  62
2         11  56  96  75   2  24  18
3         95  43  82  87  54  89  39
4         76  31  94  72  14  39  41
5         66  83  11  77  31   0   4
```

We aim for an allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (95), so we allocate it to them.
2. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (90), so we allocate it to them.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (96), so we allocate it to them.
4. **Agent 5** highly values item 1 (83), so we allocate it to them.
5. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (62), so we allocate it to them.
6. **Agent 4** highly values item 3 (72), so we allocate it to them.
7. For the remaining item 5, since Agent 0 values it at 87 (the highest among the unallocated agents), we assign it to **Agent 0**.

Here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 5, which they value at a total of 177.
- Agent 1 receives item 6, which they value at 62.
- Agent 2 receives item 2, which they value at 96.
- Agent 3 receives item 0, which they value at 95.
- Agent 4 receives item 3, which they value at 72.
- Agent 5 receives item 1, which they value at 83.

Each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and this allocation attempts to minimize envy by aligning allocations with preferences.
