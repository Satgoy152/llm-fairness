Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  68  68  43  76  31  31
1  37  47  28  53  39  13  27
2   0  32  41   5  45  97  18
3  20  65  40  72  50  22  33
4  66  80  55  89  46  86  36
5  58  84  27  21  11  93  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible, ideally targeting envy-freeness or minimizing envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

We'll use a heuristic approach to allocate items based on the highest valuations while aiming to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [4, 68, 68, 43, 76, 31, 31]
   - Allocate item 4 (value 76) to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [37, 47, 28, 53, 39, 13, 27]
   - Allocate item 3 (value 53) to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [0, 32, 41, 5, 45, 97, 18]
   - Allocate item 5 (value 97) to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [20, 65, 40, 72, 50, 22, 33]
   - Allocate item 1 (value 65) to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values: [66, 80, 55, 89, 46, 86, 36]
   - Allocate item 2 (value 55) to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Values: [58, 84, 27, 21, 11, 93, 62]
   - Allocate items 0 (value 58) and 6 (value 62) to agent 5.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value assigned to each agent and avoid envy as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```
