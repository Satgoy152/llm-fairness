Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  56  11  53  30  22  81
1  87  93  11  84  64   8   5
2  16  73  27  29  52  75  89
3  32  17  38  94  16  21  20
4  34  68  50  10  37   5  27
5   7  51  89  59   2  26  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given that we have 6 agents and 7 items, not every agent will receive an item, but we'll attempt to distribute them in a manner that minimizes envy.

One approach is to allocate the items to the agents who value them the most. We can do this by looking at the highest valuations across all agents for each item, and assign that item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (87).
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (93).
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 5 (89).
   - Allocate to Agent 5.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (94).
   - Allocate to Agent 3.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (64).
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (75).
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (89).
   - Allocate to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, potentially minimizing envy as each agent receives their most valued items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and while not all agents receive items, those who do receive items they value highly.
