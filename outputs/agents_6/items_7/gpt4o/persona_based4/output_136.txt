Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  31  44  53  33  33  96
1  29  28  79  93  49  55  72
2  81  32  69  75   5  48  87
3  13  94  51  11  32   9  92
4  58  81  40  44  53  15  16
5  57  63  13  51  77  59  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the Max-Min Share (MMS) approach. The goal is to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items that is as close as possible to their fair share, minimizing envy.

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: First, we calculate the total value each agent places on all items.

2. **Determine Fair Share**: Compute the fair share for each agent as the total valuation divided by the number of agents.

3. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: We will aim to allocate items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. 

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (96), Item 3 (53)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 2 (79)
   - Since Item 3 is already allocated, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (81), Item 6 (87)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (94), Item 6 (92)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (81), Item 0 (58)
   - Since Item 1 is allocated, allocate Item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (77), Item 1 (63)
   - Since Item 4 is allocated, allocate Item 5 to Agent 5.

At this point, 6 items have been allocated. The remaining item is 3.

### Allocating the Remaining Item
- **Available Item**: Item 3 is available and has not been allocated.
- Recheck the agents to allocate Item 3 to the agent with the least allocated value so far or to reduce the potential for envy.

Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1, as it complements their existing allocation and balances the fair share more evenly.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance each agent's total value received in terms of their preferences, trying to minimize envy. Each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated.
