Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  58  61  45  50  41  16
1   8   7  95  53  52   3  73
2  86  12  21  72  26  96  64
3  72  64  27  68  18  93   8
4  99  17  74  45  84  93  28
5  10  44  31   3  76  38   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and trying to achieve envy-freeness, we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or a bidding method. Here, I'll use a simple approach that aims to maximize fairness based on the given valuations, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of their valuable items.

Let's consider the following strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to make sure the total number of items allocated is 7.

By analyzing the table, we assign items as follows:

- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 4 (highest value of 99)
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 0 (second-highest value of 58, since Agent 3 also has a high value of 64 but would get another item)
- Item 2: Assigned to Agent 1 (highest value of 95)
- Item 3: Assigned to Agent 2 (highest value of 72)
- Item 4: Assigned to Agent 4 (highest value of 84)
- Item 5: Assigned to Agent 2 (highest value of 96)
- Item 6: Assigned to Agent 1 (second-highest value of 73, as Agent 1 does not get item 4 which Agent 4 prefers more)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 4],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the overall value received by each agent while trying to minimize envy. Note that Agent 3 and Agent 5 do not receive any items, as their values for the available items were not the highest compared to other agents.
