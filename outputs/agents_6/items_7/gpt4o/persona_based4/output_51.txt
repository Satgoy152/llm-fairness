Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  86  68  65  50  14  33
1  68  69  93  79  10  22  51
2  54  32  59  41  26   3  66
3  67  83  81  13   9  10   7
4  36   4  39  15  33  35  14
5  74  74  44  77  81  48   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [74 74 44 77 81 48  4]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (86), so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 highly (93), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 highly (66), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 highly (67), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has relatively low valuations across the board, but values item 5 the most (35), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 4 highly (81), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 5.
7. This leaves item 3, which is valued moderately by several agents. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 5, as Agent 5 has the next highest valuation for this item (77).

This allocation should ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4, 3]
}
```
