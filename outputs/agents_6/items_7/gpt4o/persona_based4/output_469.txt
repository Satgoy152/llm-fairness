Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  56  64  26  56  86   3
1  58  40  83  33  22  26  54
2  61  15   7  54  55  63  50
3  39  78   9  11  78  14  28
4  41  71  45  41  48  78  52
5   8  99  80  83  87  23  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the constraints and the valuations provided, we can attempt to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's consider each item individually and try to allocate it to the agent who values it the most:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 61.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 5 values it the most at 99.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 83.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 5 values it the most at 83.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 5 values it the most at 87.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 86.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 54.

After this initial allocation based on the highest valuations, we can check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 6
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: (None)
- Agent 4: (None)
- Agent 5: Items 1, 3, 4

Agent 3 and Agent 4 have no items. We need to ensure all agents are included, even if they end up with no items (as long as envy-freeness is maintained and all items are allocated).

Let's present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, respects the highest individual valuations, and each agent is accounted for.
