Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  20  87  89  73  33  63
1  40  68  23  80  41  94   7
2  63  54  20  36   0  55  31
3  45  84  41  25   3  62  88
4  51  78  93  71  48  98  28
5  39  33   6  55  57  50  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents, we should aim to minimize envy and try to balance the total valuation each agent receives relative to their own valuations. This is a classic problem in fair division, where we often use methods like the Adjusted Winner procedure or the Envy-free method to achieve a fair distribution. Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Agents**: 
   - For each agent, identify the items with the highest valuations.

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - First, allocate the highest-valued items for each agent if possible.

3. **Reallocation for Balance**:
   - Adjust allocations to ensure that all items are distributed, and no agent has significantly higher envy.

The table provided gives us a matrix of valuations:

| Agent (A) | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0         | 39     | 20     | 87     | 89     | 73     | 33     | 63     |
| 1         | 40     | 68     | 23     | 80     | 41     | 94     | 7      |
| 2         | 63     | 54     | 20     | 36     | 0      | 55     | 31     |
| 3         | 45     | 84     | 41     | 25     | 3      | 62     | 88     |
| 4         | 51     | 78     | 93     | 71     | 48     | 98     | 28     |
| 5         | 39     | 33     | 6      | 55     | 57     | 50     | 10     |

### Fair Allocation

After careful consideration and adjustments, the allocation is as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (87), Item 4 (73)
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (94)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (63)
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (88)
- **Agent 4**: Item 1 (78)
- **Agent 5**: Item 3 (55)

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets items they highly value.

### JSON Format Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent's top preferences are considered, attempting to minimize envy among agents.
