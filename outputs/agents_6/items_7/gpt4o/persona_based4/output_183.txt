Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  16  88  85  48  55  62
1  24  73  63  32  54  94  18
2   4  32  44  85  43  84   4
3  60  96  19  97  25   1   2
4  42  53  69  51  46  26  38
5  21  28   1   2  78  94  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve a division where each agent receives an allocation that they value highly while minimizing envy. Although it's difficult to achieve perfect envy-freeness in practice, we can attempt to approximate it by considering each agent's preferences.

Given the valuations, let's allocate the items in a way that attempts to satisfy each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the most (88).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the most (94).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the most (85).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the most (97), but it's already taken by Agent 2. The next highest is item 1 (96).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the most (69), but it's already taken by Agent 0. The next highest is item 1 (53), but it's already taken by Agent 3. Next, item 4 (46).
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 5 and 6 the most (94 for both), but item 5 is taken by Agent 1. Assign item 6.

Let's assign the remaining items to the agents who value them next highest:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 3 (60).
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 4 (46).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 0, 1
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 6

This allocation tries to give each agent at least one item they highly value, without leaving any item unallocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested json format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6]
}
```
