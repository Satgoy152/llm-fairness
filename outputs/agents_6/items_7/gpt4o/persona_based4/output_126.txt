Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  92  87  81  93  84  80
1  56  73  71   9   1   5  22
2  63  63  44  87  77  62  45
3  65  18  37  84  27  10  82
4  74  96  41  79  94  25  24
5  90   5  71   1  49  43  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents, we can use a method called the "Envy-Free Allocation" approach. This approach aims to distribute items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, let's go through a process to allocate the items.

### Steps:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Evaluate the total value of each item for each agent. Ideally, each agent should receive items that maximize their total value.

2. **Fair Division**: Since we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will end up with 2 items, and the others with 1.

3. **Allocation Strategy**: We will attempt to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring no one is envious.

### Allocation:

To begin, we look at the highest-valued items for each agent and try to allocate based on the highest preference:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 4 (93).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 0 (56).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 3 (87).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 0 (65), but since agent 1 has item 0, the next highest is item 6 (82).
- **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 4 (94), but since agent 0 has item 4, the next highest is item 1 (96).
- **Agent 5**: Highest value is item 0 (90), but it's taken, so the next highest is item 2 (71).

Now, let's allocate items to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (93) 
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (56)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (87)
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (82)
- **Agent 4**: Item 1 (96)
- **Agent 5**: Item 2 (71)

This leaves item 5 unallocated, which has the following values for each agent:

- Agent 0: 84
- Agent 1: 5
- Agent 2: 62
- Agent 3: 10
- Agent 4: 25
- Agent 5: 43

The highest value for item 5 is for agent 0. Thus, agent 0 can receive item 5.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations, with agent 0 receiving two items due to their highest valuations of the remaining item. This distribution respects the constraints of envying-free as much as possible given the limited number of items and agents.
