Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13   5  69  67  72  33  51
1  60  56  43  38  15  34  11
2  78  53   3  86   3  67   7
3  37  25   7  40  47  58  34
4  78  24  37  13  83  65  60
5  24  90  88  38  59  45  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation, ideally aiming for envy-freeness. Given the valuations, we'll try to distribute the items to maximize total satisfaction.

To achieve this, we can use a greedy approach where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item until all items are allocated.

Let's look at the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (78)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value: Agent 5 (90)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value: Agent 5 (88)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (86)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value: Agent 4 (83)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (67)

7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (51)

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item. We'll adjust allocations to ensure fairness, prioritizing agents with fewer items if necessary.

### Adjusted Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (reallocated from Agent 2, who still has the highest value for Item 5)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0, 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (reallocated from Agent 4)
- **Agent 4**: Item 2 (reallocated from Agent 5)
- **Agent 5**: Item 1

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on the initial valuations.
