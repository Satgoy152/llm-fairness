Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  65  57  91  34  17  33
1  86  46  21   6  69  70  31
2  83  59  94  34  47  18  89
3  93  20  84  40   2  13  64
4   2  75  87  26  62  18  99
5  70  25  55  96  64  83  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent based on their own valuation. Given that we have 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will end up with more items than others. However, we will try to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance these considerations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (91) and item 1 (65).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (86) and item 5 (70).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (94) and item 6 (89).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (93) and item 2 (84).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 6 (99) and item 2 (87).
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 3 (96) and item 5 (83).

Since agent valuations overlap on certain items and given that only 7 items are to be allocated, we look for a way to minimize envy by carefully selecting items. Here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets item 3 (91).
- **Agent 1** gets item 0 (86).
- **Agent 2** gets item 6 (89).
- **Agent 3** gets item 2 (84).
- **Agent 4** gets item 4 (62).
- **Agent 5** gets items 5 (83) and 1 (25).

This allocation aims to assign each agent at least one of their higher valued items, while also ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5, 1]
}
```
