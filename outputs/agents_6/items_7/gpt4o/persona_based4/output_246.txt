Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  40  93  63  77  75  31
1  72  94  22  44  33  54  77
2  92   4  77  23  60  71  95
3  95  73  39   3  46  52  37
4  44  42  86  81   0  68  47
5  61  24  46   9  24  35  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among 6 agents, we can use a fair division method that ensures envy-freeness, meaning no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item.

To achieve this, we'll consider each agent's valuations and try to allocate items in a way that is as fair as possible. 

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 3, as they value it the highest at 95.
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 1, as they value it the highest at 94.
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 0, as they value it the highest at 93.
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 4, as they value it the highest at 81.
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 0, as they value it second highest at 77 (agent 0 already received item 2).
6. Allocate item 5 to agent 2, as they value it highest at 71.
7. Allocate item 6 to agent 5, as they value it highest at 99.

This allocation tries to maximize the sum of the agents' valuations for their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, with agent 0 receiving two items.
