Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  12  44  78  21  23  87
1  87  46   1  94  80  29  15
2  62  57  90  85  50  38  34
3  94   2  17  52  48  70  28
4  29  18  52  11  19  47  90
5  36   0  34  61  49  60  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for every item and try to maximize the utility for each agent without causing envy. In this scenario, we have 6 agents and 7 items, so one agent will receive an extra item, and some agents might receive no items. 

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  12  44  78  21  23  87
1  87  46   1  94  80  29  15
2  62  57  90  85  50  38  34
3  94   2  17  52  48  70  28
4  29  18  52  11  19  47  90
5  36   0  34  61  49  60  64
```

To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can use the following strategy:

1. Identify the item each agent values the most and try to allocate it to them.
2. Ensure that no agent envies another's allocation by considering their next highest valued items.

Following this strategy, the allocation might look like:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (87).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (94).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (90).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (94).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (90). However, since item 6 is already allocated, we assign item 5 (47), the next highest.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the most (60). However, since item 5 is already allocated, we assign item 4 (49), the next highest.

Ensure that allocations are adjusted to minimize envy:

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation tries to give each agent their highest-valued item, ensuring minimal envy. However, some agents received fewer items due to the constraint of having only 7 items, and some adjustments were made to avoid conflicts over the same item.
