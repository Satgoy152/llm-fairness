Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  63  91  19  94  74  49
1   9  14  50  29  96  94   3
2  50  83  36   2  30  95  84
3  21  23  91  26  72  65  59
4   1  35  61  41  37  98  45
5  31  34  56  56  31  14  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received an appropriate share of the items based on their valuations. This can be quite complex, but one way to approach this is to maximize the sum of each agent’s valuation for the items they receive. Given the table of valuations, let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

### Steps for Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent can value items differently, and the goal is to allocate all 7 items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.
   - We want to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, but given 7 items and 6 agents, one agent may receive two items.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by identifying the highest-valued items for each agent.
   - Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their personal valuation while ensuring that each item is allocated only once and all items are allocated.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Allocate each agent their highest-valued item that has not yet been allocated.
   - Adjust as necessary to ensure all items are allocated and no two items are allocated to the same agent when possible.

### Allocation:

Based on the valuations provided, here’s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4, but it's already taken, so assign the next highest valued item, which is item 5, to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 5, but it's already taken, so assign the next highest valued item, which is item 6, to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2.
- Agent 4 highly values item 5, but it's already taken, so item 3, which is the next, to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 highly values item 6, but it's already taken, so item 2 is already taken, so assign item 0 to Agent 5.

Ensure that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1] (next highest after 4)
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [5] (next highest after 3 and 5)
- Agent 5: [0, 3]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation method tries to maximize individual satisfaction based on their highest available valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.
