Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  85  16  77  97  42  56
1  42  36  74  30  98  74  17
2  85   4  86  47  87  91  50
3  36   6  10  46  69  81  80
4   8  57  14  62  99  46  63
5  78  31  44  49  92  90  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. We will try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value of their allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 4 (97). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 4 (98), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 2 (74). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 5 (91). Assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 5 (81), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 6 (80). Assign item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 4 (99), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 6 (63), but it's already taken. Assign item 3 (62) to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highly values item 0 (78). Assign item 0 to agent 5.

Now, all items except item 1 are assigned. We need to find an agent who can receive an additional item:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 4, their next highest is item 1 (85).
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 2, their next highest is item 1 (36).
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 5, their next highest is item 0 (85).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 6, their next highest is item 5 (81).
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 3, their next highest is item 1 (57).
- **Agent 5**: Already has item 0, their next highest is item 5 (90).

Assign item 1 to **Agent 0**, since they value it highly (85), which would make their allocation more valuable.

Here's the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
