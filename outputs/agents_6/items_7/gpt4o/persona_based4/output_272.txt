Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  19  10  14  25  33  73
1  21  56  27  54  90  71  32
2  82  31  89  38  47   8  10
3  41  80  38  74  97  65  90
4  46  63  44  75  21  51  53
5  47  56  86   8  67   7  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider an allocation strategy that could lead to an envy-free division or at least minimize envy among the agents. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the table of valuations for the 6 agents and 7 items, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation that respects these constraints:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:** [64, 19, 10, 14, 25, 33, 73]
2. **Agent 1's valuations:** [21, 56, 27, 54, 90, 71, 32]
3. **Agent 2's valuations:** [82, 31, 89, 38, 47, 8, 10]
4. **Agent 3's valuations:** [41, 80, 38, 74, 97, 65, 90]
5. **Agent 4's valuations:** [46, 63, 44, 75, 21, 51, 53]
6. **Agent 5's valuations:** [47, 56, 86, 8, 67, 7, 60]

By analyzing these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0:** Gets item 0 (highest value 64).
2. **Agent 1:** Gets item 4 (highest value 90).
3. **Agent 2:** Gets item 2 (highest value 89).
4. **Agent 3:** Gets item 6 (highest value 90).
5. **Agent 4:** Gets item 3 (highest value 75).
6. **Agent 5:** Gets item 1 (highest value 56) and item 5 (highest value 7).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they highly value, minimizing the potential for envy. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 5]
}
```

This configuration ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
