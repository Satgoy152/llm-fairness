Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  91  97  35  91  76  60
1  87  46  40  31  42   0  35
2  17  68  55  92  76  13  73
3  15  59  55  83  68  20  32
4  61  98  13  10  62  94  64
5  46  85  11  43  94  50  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items among agents in a way that is fair and envy-free, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the minimum value among the agents or minimizes the potential for envy. Given the constraints of integer allocation and the valuations provided, one heuristic method is to allocate items by considering both the total value an agent might receive and balancing the distribution to minimize potential envy.

The table of valuations for the agents is as follows:

```
Agent 0: [92, 91, 97, 35, 91, 76, 60]
Agent 1: [87, 46, 40, 31, 42, 0, 35]
Agent 2: [17, 68, 55, 92, 76, 13, 73]
Agent 3: [15, 59, 55, 83, 68, 20, 32]
Agent 4: [61, 98, 13, 10, 62, 94, 64]
Agent 5: [46, 85, 11, 43, 94, 50, 48]
```

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents such that the total perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.
2. Ensure each item is allocated to only one agent.

Following these steps, a potential allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives item 2 (value 97)
- Agent 1 receives item 0 (value 87)
- Agent 2 receives item 3 (value 92)
- Agent 3 receives item 4 (value 68)
- Agent 4 receives item 1 (value 98)
- Agent 5 receives item 5 (value 94)
- Agent 0 also receives item 6 (value 60) to balance the distribution

This allocation attempts to distribute the highest values first to ensure a fair division, and then balances the remaining distribution to minimize envy. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
