Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  88  46  41  54  18  94
1  95  53  88  66   5  38  43
2  88  34  42  40  61  38   2
3  10  13  51  67  74  97   9
4   5   0   7  63  61  21  33
5  27  12  31  57  38  32  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where no agent envies another agent's allocation, considering their respective valuations. This is known as an envy-free allocation, but since achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible goods sometimes isn't possible, we'll aim for a balanced allocation where each agent receives items based on their preferences as much as possible.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0:  86, 88, 46, 41, 54, 18, 94
Agent 1:  95, 53, 88, 66,  5, 38, 43
Agent 2:  88, 34, 42, 40, 61, 38,  2
Agent 3:  10, 13, 51, 67, 74, 97,  9
Agent 4:   5,  0,  7, 63, 61, 21, 33
Agent 5:  27, 12, 31, 57, 38, 32, 86
```

We can follow a strategy of assigning each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring all items are allocated and at least some balance is maintained across the agents.

1. **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 1 (95), allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 0 (88), allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 1 (88), allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 3 (67), allocate to Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 3 (74), allocate to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 3 (97), allocate to Agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value by Agent 0 (94), allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 3, 4, 5
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 4, 5],
    "4": [],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is given to one agent, and the distribution respects the highest valuations while ensuring all 7 items are allocated.
