Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  53  65  39  89  71  79
1  60  31   1  88  65  51  53
2  91  13  70  75  75  43  31
3  49   0  83  62   2  46  69
4  40  46  54  28  50  95  52
5  92  43  46  62  15  98  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that no agent feels another agent has a better allocation based on their valuations. However, given that there are more items than agents, perfect envy-freeness might be difficult to achieve under integer allocation constraints. Nevertheless, we can aim for a reasonable allocation such that the total perceived value is balanced across agents.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix for a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest with 89. We allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3 the most with 88. We allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 with 91. We allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the highest with 83. We allocate item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 5 with a valuation of 95. We allocate item 5 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 0 at 92, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5, but it's also taken. We allocate item 1 to agent 5 with a valuation of 43.

At this point, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 1 more item, which is item 6.

Considering fairness and ensuring everyone has some allocation, let's look at the remaining item 6. It has the highest valuation by agent 0 (79), but agent 0 already has a high-value allocation. Agent 3 also values item 6 moderately (69), so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
