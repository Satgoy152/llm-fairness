Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  75  57   5  16   6  45
1  38  76  77  93  23   6  56
2  64  18  40  26  44  99  46
3  49  92  76  87  52  30  87
4  80  63  71  39  91   9   2
5  60  94  90  59  20  53   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 6 agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of items received by another agent over their own allocation, based on their own valuations.

To achieve this, we can use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" process, considering the agents’ valuations for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent’s satisfaction with their own allocation.

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 1 (94).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (93).
3. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4 (91).
4. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 (99).
5. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (70).
6. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 6 (87).
7. **Agent 0** can take item 2 (57), as it is the one remaining with the highest value to them.

Now, let's assign these items to the agents:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Item [6]
- Agent 4: Item [4]
- Agent 5: Item [1]

In this allocation process, each agent gets the item they value the most among the remaining items, which helps in achieving a fair distribution while aiming for envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1]
}
```
