Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  58  56  54  55  82  75
1  36   1  38  14  56  21  20
2  89  14  63   1  39   2  89
3  28  83  55  17  73  59  74
4  77  45  80  70  44  63  61
5  37  32  88   2  35  32  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents with respect to their valuations, we aim to minimize envy among the agents. The goal is to ensure that each agent values their received items at least as much as every other agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

Let's try to create an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 5, and 6.
2. Agent 1 has relatively lower valuations across the board, with item 4 being the highest.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 0 and 6.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 highly but also has some preference for item 6.

Given these preferences, we can try the following allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 since they value it the highest.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 for their highest preference.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 as it is their highest preference.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it is not highly valued by others and Agent 1 has generally low valuations.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, who has a preference for items 0, 5, and 6, but 0 and 6 are better for others.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it's one of their higher preferences.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it's among their highest preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the preferences of the agents and ensures that the total number of items allocated is seven.
