Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  16  45  97  88  42   0
1  41  30  21  62  88  32  30
2  87  65  92  68  17  33   2
3  57  25  72  43  75  64  90
4  14  73  39  33  14  84  52
5  52   4  77  48  78  51   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the 7 items among the 6 agents fairly, we need to consider an allocation that minimizes envy, aiming for an envy-free or as close to envy-free allocation as possible. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve that:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (88).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (92).
   - Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (90).
   - Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (73).
   - Agent 5 values item 4 the highest (78), but it conflicts with Agent 1's preference.

2. **Initial Allocation Attempt:**
   - Allocate high-value items to respective agents:
     - Agent 0 gets item 3.
     - Agent 1 gets item 4.
     - Agent 2 gets item 2.
     - Agent 3 gets item 6.
     - Agent 4 gets item 1.
     - Agent 5 needs an alternative since item 4 is taken. The next best option is item 2, but it's also taken, so consider alternatives based on overall preferences.

3. **Resolve Conflicts and Complete Allocation:**
   - Check remaining items: 0, 5.
   - Allocate the remaining items based on preferences:
     - Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 2, but allocating it to Agent 0 is better since Agent 2 already received a highly valued item.
     - Item 5 goes to Agent 5 as it is among their next preferred items.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [3, 0]
   - Agent 1: [4]
   - Agent 2: [2]
   - Agent 3: [6]
   - Agent 4: [1]
   - Agent 5: [5]

By ensuring each agent receives at least one item they highly value (where possible) and adjusting to minimize envy, we achieve a fair allocation.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```
