Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  89  97  46  35  26  10
1  45  73  64  76   8  11  32
2   9  13  75  54  22  85  98
3  86  42  75  32  14  45   9
4  12  62  51  99  41   7  81
5  93  55   7  26  26  61  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we will try to distribute the items such that each agent's perceived total value is as balanced as possible.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [98, 89, 97, 46, 35, 26, 10]
- Agent 1: [45, 73, 64, 76, 8, 11, 32]
- Agent 2: [9, 13, 75, 54, 22, 85, 98]
- Agent 3: [86, 42, 75, 32, 14, 45, 9]
- Agent 4: [12, 62, 51, 99, 41, 7, 81]
- Agent 5: [93, 55, 7, 26, 26, 61, 88]

To achieve a fair distribution, we will try to balance the total perceived value for each agent. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1]
- Agent 1 receives items: [3]
- Agent 2 receives items: [5, 6]
- Agent 3 receives items: []
- Agent 4 receives items: [4]
- Agent 5 receives items: [2]

Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1 with total valuation 187 (98 + 89).
- Agent 1 receives item 3 with valuation 76.
- Agent 2 receives items 5 and 6 with total valuation 183 (85 + 98).
- Agent 3 does not receive an item, as their highest valuation item (0) is already allocated, and this ensures others have satisfactory allocations.
- Agent 4 receives item 4 with valuation 41.
- Agent 5 receives item 2 with valuation 7.

Let's note that this allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items they value highly while considering the constraints of integer allocation and the limited number of items. Now, we'll present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
