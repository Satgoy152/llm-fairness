Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  83  83  69  19  90  35
1  72  39  24  34  24  16  24
2  28  23  59  28  15  83  41
3  94  96  97  80  66  57  34
4  98   7  72  80  63  45  92
5  12  37  85  93  54  66  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we aim to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share. A common method to achieve this is to use the "maximum envy-free" strategy, where we try to minimize the maximum envy.

Let's start by examining the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  83  83  69  19  90  35
1  72  39  24  34  24  16  24
2  28  23  59  28  15  83  41
3  94  96  97  80  66  57  34
4  98   7  72  80  63  45  92
5  12  37  85  93  54  66  98
```

Given that we have 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. The goal is to fairly distribute these items based on the valuations while considering the envy-free criterion. Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. First, assign the highest valued items to agents who value them most.
2. Try to ensure each agent gets at least one item they value relatively highly.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 90), which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 72), which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 59), which is one of the higher values for them.
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (value 96), which is the highest value in the entire table.
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 63), which is among their higher valuations.
- Agent 5 gets item 6 (value 98), which is the highest value for them.

This allocates 6 items, and we have one item left to allocate. We aim to minimize envy by giving the remaining item 3 to agent 5, who has a high valuation for it. Let's ensure the allocations are balanced:

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item that they value highly, and agent 5 receives an additional item due to their high valuation for it.
