Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  42  59   8   0   3  43
1  97  56  40  75   8  45  87
2  44  23  13  99  89  21  22
3  41  20  37  38   9  10   6
4  49  19  96  76  28  48  54
5  92  64  94  80  67  14  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value any other agent's allocation. This is a complex problem, and achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible. However, we can strive for a solution that minimizes envy.

We have 6 agents and 7 items, so some agents will receive more items than others. Let's try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Given the table of valuations:

```
         0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent 0  28  42  59   8   0   3  43
Agent 1  97  56  40  75   8  45  87
Agent 2  44  23  13  99  89  21  22
Agent 3  41  20  37  38   9  10   6
Agent 4  49  19  96  76  28  48  54
Agent 5  92  64  94  80  67  14  50
```

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (97) and item 3 (75). Let's allocate these items to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 5** values item 2 (94) highly, so we assign item 2 to Agent 5.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 (89) highly, so we assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** values item 6 (43) more than others, so we assign item 6 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 (48) more than others, so we assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 3** will get item 1, which is the remaining item.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by prioritizing each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.
