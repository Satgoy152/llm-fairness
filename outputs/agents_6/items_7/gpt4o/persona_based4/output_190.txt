Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  32  99  98  49  24  85
1  58  56  22  27  47  58  68
2  14  85  72  36  87  47   6
3  85  33  40  28  70  41  61
4  34  32  25  59  78   3  74
5  60   4  11  13  82  41  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider different approaches to ensure that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible. One common method is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations and the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we can use a simple approach to allocate the items. One possible way is to maximize the minimum satisfaction or to ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, considering the total number of items is 7.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 2 with a value of 99. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 0 with a value of 58. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 1 with a value of 85. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 0 with a value of 85 (already taken), so consider the second-highest item, item 4 with a value of 70. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 4 with a value of 78 (already taken), so consider the second-highest item, item 6 with a value of 74. Assign item 6 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 6 with a value of 93 (already taken), so consider the next-highest item, item 4 with a value of 82 (already taken). Next, consider item 0 with a value of 60 (already taken), so the next available is item 5 with a value of 41. Assign item 5 to Agent 5.

Finally, we have allocated 6 items so far. We need to ensure that the remaining item is also allocated. The remaining item is item 3, which can be allocated to Agent 3, as it has a moderately high value of 28 for Agent 3 and is a reasonable addition to their allocation.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and at least one item is allocated to each agent based on their preferences.
