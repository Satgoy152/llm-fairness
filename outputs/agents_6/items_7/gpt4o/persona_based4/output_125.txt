Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  41  56  11   3  36  35
1   4  56  36  27  72  50  67
2  65  94  55  48  99  58  31
3  73  48  55  60  21  53  82
4  13  55  19  44  41  58  59
5  56  54  58  45  42  29  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of any other agent. Given the valuations table, we can use a simple heuristic approach to achieve this. We will try to give each agent the item(s) they value the most while ensuring that all items are allocated. 

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Identify each agent's highest-valued items**: 
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (56)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (72)
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (99)
   - Agent 3: Item 0 (73)
   - Agent 4: Item 5 (58)
   - Agent 5: Item 2 (58)

2. **Allocate unique highest-valued items first**:
   - Agent 3 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets item 4.
   - Agent 4 gets item 5.

3. **Resolve conflicts for highest-valued items**:
   - Both Agent 0 and Agent 5 value item 2 highly. We allocate item 2 to Agent 0 and give Agent 5 their next highest available item, which is item 3 (45).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 4, but since it's already allocated to Agent 1, give Agent 2 their next highest available item, which is item 1 (94).

4. **Distribute remaining items**:
   - Remaining item is item 6. It can be allocated to Agent 5, as they have already received item 3.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and no agent has more than one item except for when necessary:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Items 3, 6

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3, 6]
}
```
