Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  19  32  22  66  57  32
1  95  58  84  17  95  22  54
2  54  15  33  82  93   7   7
3  44  44  45  81  31  37  60
4  80  68  31  42  41  44  87
5  12  51  81  38   2  88   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 58 84 17 95 22 54]
 [54 15 33 82 93  7  7]
 [44 44 45 81 31 37 60]
 [80 68 31 42 41 44 87]
 [12 51 81 38  2 88  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we can aim for a solution that is as fair as possible by considering the preferences (valuations) of agents for each item.

Below is one possible allocation that takes into account the valuations of the agents:

1. **Agent 0** gets item 4: Valuation = 66
2. **Agent 1** gets item 0: Valuation = 95
3. **Agent 2** gets item 3: Valuation = 82
4. **Agent 3** gets item 6: Valuation = 60
5. **Agent 4** gets item 5: Valuation = 44
6. **Agent 5** gets item 2: Valuation = 81
7. **Agent 4** also gets item 1: Valuation = 68

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item (except for agent 4 who receives two items), and it aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their strongest preferences.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 1],
    "5": [2]
}
```
