Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  53   3  63  47  43  48
1  88  40   2  84  37  70  91
2  54  26  42  22  90  26  25
3  89  16  50  68   7  54  60
4  90  88  41  95  43  58   9
5  54  10  22  47  45  87   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate 7 items among 6 agents based on their valuations such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, the allocation should minimize envy among the agents.

The valuations are as follows:

```
Agent\Item | 0  1  2  3  4  5  6
0          | 91 53  3 63 47 43 48
1          | 88 40  2 84 37 70 91
2          | 54 26 42 22 90 26 25
3          | 89 16 50 68  7 54 60
4          | 90 88 41 95 43 58  9
5          | 54 10 22 47 45 87  3
```

We'll use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Identify the highest value each agent has for any item** and allocate that item to the agent if it hasn't already been taken.
2. **Repeat** the process until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (91), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest (91), so allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (90), so allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 0, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 3 (68), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest, but it's taken. Next highest is item 1 (88), so allocate item 1 to agent 4.
- **Agent 5** values item 5 the highest (87), so allocate item 5 to agent 5.

Now, all items except item 2 have been allocated. We need to allocate item 2 to ensure all items are distributed:

- No agent has item 2 as their highest preference among remaining unallocated items. However, Agent 3 values item 2 the highest among remaining items for them. Thus, allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least some value from their allocation, and all items are fairly distributed.
