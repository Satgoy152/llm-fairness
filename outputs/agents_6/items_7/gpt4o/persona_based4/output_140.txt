Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  21  22  42  62  18  81
1  27  52  80   9  43  47  95
2  15  14  35  49  89  33   2
3  32  35   0  31  28  13  41
4  12  46  17  80   1   6  45
5  14  56  70  67   4  63  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing envy among the agents. Given the valuations of the agents for each item, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on their preferences.

Let's try to allocate the items step-by-step considering the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation for item 0 (93) and item 6 (81). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 6 (95). Assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 (89) the most. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a relatively high valuation for item 1 (35) compared to others. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 (80) highly. Assign item 3 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 5 (63). Assign item 5 to agent 5.
7. The only remaining item is item 2. We need to assign it to an agent who hasn't received an item or has the least value so far. Agent 2 has a need for more items given their allocation so far. Assign item 2 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to minimize envy by distributing the items based on the highest preferences of each agent for the available items.
