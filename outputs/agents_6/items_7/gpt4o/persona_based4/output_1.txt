Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  80  48  77  16  22  65
1  99  26  97  72  19  75  27
2  34  45  32  67  51  23  31
3  25  71  64  57  84  68  54
4  61  40   1  55  45  34  63
5  35  20  56   3  60  72  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair division of the 7 items among the 6 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for each item. Our goal is to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, which is the essence of envy-freeness.

Firstly, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items, which helps us understand their overall preferences:

- Agent 0: 40 + 80 + 48 + 77 + 16 + 22 + 65 = 348
- Agent 1: 99 + 26 + 97 + 72 + 19 + 75 + 27 = 415
- Agent 2: 34 + 45 + 32 + 67 + 51 + 23 + 31 = 283
- Agent 3: 25 + 71 + 64 + 57 + 84 + 68 + 54 = 423
- Agent 4: 61 + 40 + 1 + 55 + 45 + 34 + 63 = 299
- Agent 5: 35 + 20 + 56 + 3 + 60 + 72 + 72 = 318

Next, we will try to allocate items in such a way that the sum of values for each agent's allocation is as balanced as possible, while also ensuring that no agent envies another.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 1 values item 0 (99) the highest across all agents. We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 1 (80) highly. We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1 also highly values item 2 (97). We allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 (84) the highest. We allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 5 values item 5 (72) and item 6 (72) equally high. We allocate item 5 to Agent 5.
6. Agent 0 also values item 3 (77) highly. We allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
7. Agent 4 values item 6 relatively highly (63), considering we want to distribute remaining items effectively. We allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent receives items in a way that attempts to balance their perceived value, minimizing envy among agents.
