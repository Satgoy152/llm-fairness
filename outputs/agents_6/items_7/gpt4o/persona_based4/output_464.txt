Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41   5  28  80  84  64  72
1  90  69  82   9  51  14  46
2  98  95  95  18  77  39  80
3  86  11  42  56  70  68  27
4  68  18  42  82  50  62  75
5  15  51  51  23   0  51  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with the goal of envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility across all agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value assigned by each agent to all items.
2. Try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the minimum value received by any agent. 

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0** has relatively high values for items 3 (80) and 4 (84). 
- **Agent 1** values item 0 (90) highly.
- **Agent 2** values item 0 (98) and item 1 (95) highly.
- **Agent 3** prefers item 0 (86).
- **Agent 4** values item 3 (82) highly.
- **Agent 5** has a relatively even valuation, with item 1 (51) being one of the higher values.

Based on this preference, we could allocate the items as follows to ensure each agent gets a fair share, with the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2, as it holds high value for them.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 5, as it's one of the higher valued items for them.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 5, as it matches their value for item 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 4, since it holds high value for them.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it holds high value for them.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, as it is one of the few remaining items with moderate value.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1, as it provides a reasonable value for them.

This allocation aims to balance the distribution based on highest preferences and ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1, 2]
}
```
