Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  35  91  55  37  39  76
1  15   5   1  17  64  47  95
2  34  96  19  82  20  33  30
3   9  17  17  18  40  66   8
4  65  84  56  96  33  92  72
5  93   7  74  11  34  30  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives a combination of items that maximizes their perceived value. This can be a complex problem, but we can approach it with a simple heuristic to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that no agent receives more than two items, as there are 6 agents and 7 items.

Let's analyze the table and make the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 5 values it most at 93.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it most at 96.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it most at 91.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it most at 96.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it most at 64.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it second most at 92 (after item 3).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it most at 95.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: item 2
- Agent 1: items 4, 6
- Agent 2: item 1
- Agent 3: (no item allocated, but will ensure at least one item is reallocated for fairness)
- Agent 4: items 3, 5
- Agent 5: item 0

This allocation is not entirely fair as Agent 3 gets nothing. To ensure fairness and that each agent gets at least one item, we can reallocate item 5 from Agent 4 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 values item 5 more than item 3.

Here's the adjusted allocation:

- Agent 0: item 2
- Agent 1: items 4, 6
- Agent 2: item 1
- Agent 3: item 5
- Agent 4: item 3
- Agent 5: item 0

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item. Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0]
}
```
