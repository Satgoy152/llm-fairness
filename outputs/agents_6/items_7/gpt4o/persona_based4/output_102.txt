Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  95  76  92  15  67  12
1  88  31  30  84  90  35   2
2  86  84  95  48  24  39  64
3  42  33  44  25  32  19   9
4  82  62  18  39  60  87  55
5  34  88  80  76  19  45  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an approach that balances the valuations of items across agents. One potential method is to use the "maximin" strategy, which aims to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives.

Let's evaluate the total valuation of each agent for all items and allocate items to balance these totals as evenly as possible.

First, let's calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: 68 + 95 + 76 + 92 + 15 + 67 + 12 = 425
- Agent 1: 88 + 31 + 30 + 84 + 90 + 35 + 2 = 360
- Agent 2: 86 + 84 + 95 + 48 + 24 + 39 + 64 = 440
- Agent 3: 42 + 33 + 44 + 25 + 32 + 19 + 9 = 204
- Agent 4: 82 + 62 + 18 + 39 + 60 + 87 + 55 = 403
- Agent 5: 34 + 88 + 80 + 76 + 19 + 45 + 65 = 407

Now, we can proceed with an allocation strategy. Given that there are 7 items, each agent will receive at least one item, but one agent will receive two items.

### Allocation Strategy

1. Start by giving one high-value item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Continue assigning items to balance the total valuations.

### Allocation

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
  - Valuation: 95 + 67 = 162
- Agent 1: Item [4]
  - Valuation: 90
- Agent 2: Item [2]
  - Valuation: 95
- Agent 3: Item [6]
  - Valuation: 9
- Agent 4: Item [0]
  - Valuation: 82
- Agent 5: Item [3]
  - Valuation: 76

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives the item(s) they value the most, while also aiming to balance the total value each agent receives as evenly as possible.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives a share that reflects their valuations as fairly as possible.
