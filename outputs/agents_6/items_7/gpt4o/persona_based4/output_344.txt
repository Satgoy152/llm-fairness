Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  68  52   0  53  65  41
1  72   5  44  12  22  44  62
2  59  47  70  40  88  70  99
3  44  26  33   6  42   2  47
4  12  64  87  22  20  71  33
5  57  62  54  97  29  56   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a division that minimizes envy. Although achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible goods is not always possible, we can strive to get as close as possible. One approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method, which seeks to maximize the product of the utilities of the agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to maximize the minimum utility gain.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation
- Agent 0: 33 + 68 + 52 + 0 + 53 + 65 + 41 = 312
- Agent 1: 72 + 5 + 44 + 12 + 22 + 44 + 62 = 261
- Agent 2: 59 + 47 + 70 + 40 + 88 + 70 + 99 = 473
- Agent 3: 44 + 26 + 33 + 6 + 42 + 2 + 47 = 200
- Agent 4: 12 + 64 + 87 + 22 + 20 + 71 + 33 = 309
- Agent 5: 57 + 62 + 54 + 97 + 29 + 56 + 4 = 359

### Step 2: Allocate Items

Allocating items to maximize fairness based on valuations:

- **Item 0**: Highest value to Agent 1 (72), allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Highest value to Agent 0 (68), allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Highest value to Agent 4 (87), allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 3**: Highest value to Agent 5 (97), allocate to Agent 5.
- **Item 4**: Highest value to Agent 2 (88), allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Highest value to Agent 2 (70), allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 6**: Highest value to Agent 2 (99), allocate to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item based on their highest valuation, prioritizing those with higher total valuations to ensure fairness.

### Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 5, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to maximize the overall utility while striving for fairness.
