Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  64  64  90  14  42  72
1  17  83  15  40  50   3  84
2   3  83  57  92  57  43  96
3  36  82  80  18  62   1  88
4  83  18  20  64  51  47  60
5   7  71  79  41  13  12  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. In this problem, we have 6 agents and 7 items to allocate. We'll consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have a fair allocation.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (96) and also has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (90).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1 (83) and also values item 6 (84) highly.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 6 (96) and also values item 3 (92) highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the highest (88) and also has a high valuation for item 2 (80).
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the highest (83) but also has moderate valuations for other items.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 the highest (79) but does not have very high valuations for other items.

Based on these observations, let's try to allocate items in such a way that no agent envies another:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 6
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Item 3
- **Agent 5**: Items 4 and 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is 7. The allocations minimize envy among agents based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 5]
}
```
