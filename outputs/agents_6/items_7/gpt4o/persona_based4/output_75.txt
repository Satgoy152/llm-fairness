Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45   3  62  46  51  47  87
1  11  78   2  40  82  64  32
2  41  67  64  96  54  23  94
3   9  89  25  94  24  90  37
4  37  78  85  62  79  28  39
5   0  17  89   3  88   8  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the values provided by each agent for each item, we can use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or simply prioritize the items according to the agents' preferences to achieve a fair distribution.

Below is the step-by-step allocation based on maximizing individual satisfaction while aiming for envy-freeness:

1. **Identify the most valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (87)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (82)
   - Agent 2: Item 3 (96)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (89)
   - Agent 4: Item 2 (85)
   - Agent 5: Item 4 (88) (Since item 4 is already taken, Agent 5's next best is Item 2 (89), which is also taken. Next best is Item 6 (52), but taken by Agent 0. Finally, Item 5 (8).)

2. **Assign items based on the identified preferences:**
   - Agent 0: Item 6
   - Agent 1: Item 4
   - Agent 2: Item 3
   - Agent 3: Item 1
   - Agent 4: Item 2
   - Agent 5: Item 0

3. **Ensure all items are allocated:**
   - The remaining item, Item 5, is not yet allocated. Check for the least envy-inducing allocation for this item:
     - Item 5 is valued by Agent 3 (90), so assign to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that minimizes envy.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0]
}
```
