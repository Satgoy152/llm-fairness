Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  23  79  63  51  41  84
1  31  64  28  51  77  34  91
2  27  63  96  76  88  26  13
3  32  58  71  43  80   8  62
4  27  78  60  96  37  26   2
5  54  69  53  13  48  42  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items to the agents while considering the agents' valuations, we can apply a simple method that aims to minimize envy. One approach is to use an algorithm that assigns items sequentially to the agent who values the item the most. We also need to ensure that each agent can receive at least one item if possible, but since there are only 7 items and 6 agents, one agent may not receive any item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from agent 0 (56), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from agent 4 (78), so assign item 1 to agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from agent 2 (96), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from agent 4 (96), but since agent 4 already has an item, assign item 3 to the next highest valuation, which is agent 2 (76).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from agent 1 (77), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is from agent 0 (41), but since agent 0 already received an item, the next highest is agent 5 (42), so assign item 5 to agent 5.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is from agent 1 (91), but since agent 1 already received an item, the next highest is agent 0 (84), and since agent 0 has already received an item, the next highest is agent 3 (62), so assign item 6 to agent 3.

In this allocation, each agent except one receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, attempting to minimize envy by prioritizing the highest valuations.
