Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  10  17  66  81  22  18
1  10  37  16  70  44  51  56
2  19  86  53  76  96  46  56
3  64  44  15   3  10   2  25
4  93  34  23  48  48  83  18
5   3  48  36  77  21  80  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. Given that we have more agents (6) than items (7), some agents will naturally receive more items than others. However, we'll aim to allocate the items in such a way that the least happy agent is as happy as possible.

Let's consider the following steps to allocate the items:

1. **Sum of Valuations**: Calculate the total valuations of each agent for all items:
   - Agent 0: 290
   - Agent 1: 284
   - Agent 2: 432
   - Agent 3: 163
   - Agent 4: 347
   - Agent 5: 308

2. **Allocate High Valuation Items**: Start by assigning high-value items to agents who value them the most to ensure they get significant utility right away.

3. **Iterative Allocation**: Attempt to allocate remaining items by considering how much each item increases the utility of each agent. This ensures that the allocation is as balanced as possible.

4. **Balance and Review**: Ensure that each agent's bundle is reasonably fair by comparing the total value of items each agent receives.

Let's start allocating:

- **Item 0** (valued highest by Agent 4): Allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 1** (valued highest by Agent 2): Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 2** (valued highest by Agent 2): Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 3** (valued highest by Agent 5): Allocate to Agent 5.
- **Item 4** (valued highest by Agent 2): Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 5** (valued highest by Agent 4): Allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 6** (valued highest by Agent 1): Allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation gives a relatively balanced distribution of total valuation across agents. Agent 2 receives multiple items because they value those items significantly more than other agents. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 2, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 5],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, respects the preferences of the agents, and attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction among all agents.
