Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  31   7  92  50  58  60
1  32  51  57  21  61  75  32
2  33  25  86  29  42  92  75
3  88  79  58  15  50  92  56
4  23   8  66  31  19  54  86
5  82  76  39  25   8  49  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, given the constraint that each agent can only receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - There are 6 agents and 7 items. This means one agent will receive 2 items while the rest will receive 1 item each.
   - We should aim to allocate items such that the total value for each agent (based on their own valuations) is as close as possible to prevent envy.

2. **Valuation Matrix**:
   ```
   Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
   -------------------------------------
   0          25  31   7  92  50  58  60
   1          32  51  57  21  61  75  32
   2          33  25  86  29  42  92  75
   3          88  79  58  15  50  92  56
   4          23   8  66  31  19  54  86
   5          82  76  39  25   8  49  16
   ```

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Agent 3 has a particularly high valuation for item 0 (88) and item 5 (92), so we consider starting by allocating these items to Agent 3.
   - Next, check who values the remaining high-value items the most, ensuring no agent feels envious.

4. **Allocation Plan**:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value = 92)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (value = 61)
   - Agent 2: Item 6 (value = 75)
   - Agent 3: Items 0 and 5 (value = 88 + 92)
   - Agent 4: Item 2 (value = 66)
   - Agent 5: Item 1 (value = 76)

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Every agent receives at least one item, and Agent 3 receives two.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1]
}
```
