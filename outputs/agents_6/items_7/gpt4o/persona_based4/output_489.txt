Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  22  97  69  55  14  19
1  26  99  63  68   4  78  64
2  67  21  64  18  22  94  70
3  55  98  71   6  62  57  79
4   4  90  46  11  95  23  21
5  43   7  66   7  65  54  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations for the items and attempt to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 2 highly (97), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 1 highly (99), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 5 highly (94), so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 1 highly (98), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 6 (79), so assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 4 highly (95), so assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5:** Values item 6 highly (87), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 4 (65), but it's already taken. Next is item 2 (66), but it's already taken. Next is item 5 (54), so assign item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:

- **Remaining Items:** 0, 3
- **Agent 0:** Already has item 2. Next highest is item 0 (94), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Already has item 1. Next highest is item 3 (68), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Re-evaluating, Agent 5 has no item allocated. Let's reassign item 3 to Agent 5 since Agent 5 values it 7, and Agent 1 doesnâ€™t have a high preference for it.

Let's finalize this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to meet the criteria of each agent feeling satisfied with their share based on their valuations.
