Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  35  84  57  90  92  99
1  96  87  30  42  41  54  59
2  88  29  29  23  56  78  21
3  33  11  94  18  50  20  88
4  67  77  40  58  40  41  57
5  50  15  93  72  85  74  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation. One common approach is the envy-free algorithm or the Adjusted Winner procedure, but given the problem constraints, I will manually attempt to allocate the items to balance the valuations.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 6, so let's assign item 6 to them.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 0, so let's assign item 0 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5, so let's assign item 5 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 2, so let's assign item 2 to them.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values item 1, so let's assign item 1 to them.
6. **Agent 5**: This agent highly values item 4, so let's assign item 4 to them.

Now, we have one remaining item (item 3) to allocate. Since agent 5 has the second-highest valuation for item 3, we can allocate item 3 to agent 5 to maximize their satisfaction.

Let's put this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.
