Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  31  81  22  54  78  46
1  22  12  55  73  37  48  49
2  96   6   0  47  32  92  86
3  22  10  76  26  67  53  40
4  27  68  79  60  43   5  59
5  84  48  24  40  47  92  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive. One approach to achieve this is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) principle, which maximizes the product of the utilities each agent derives from their allocation. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 52     | 31     | 81     | 22     | 54     | 78     | 46     |
| 1     | 22     | 12     | 55     | 73     | 37     | 48     | 49     |
| 2     | 96     | 6      | 0      | 47     | 32     | 92     | 86     |
| 3     | 22     | 10     | 76     | 26     | 67     | 53     | 40     |
| 4     | 27     | 68     | 79     | 60     | 43     | 5      | 59     |
| 5     | 84     | 48     | 24     | 40     | 47     | 92     | 96     |

The goal is to allocate all 7 items to the 6 agents in a way that is fair and envy-free as much as possible. Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing valuations:

1. Agent 0 values Item 2 highly, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values Item 3 highly, so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values Item 0 highly, so allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values Item 4 highly, so allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values Item 1 highly, so allocate Item 1 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values Item 6 highly, so allocate Item 6 to Agent 5.
7. The only item left, Item 5, is valued highly by Agent 5 as well, so allocate Item 5 to Agent 5.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value significantly, while also ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by aligning the highest individual preferences with the allocations as much as possible while ensuring all items are distributed.
