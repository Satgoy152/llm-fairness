Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  57  68  54  66  24  89
1  22  30  47   2  98   6  51
2  48  47  75  17  12  68  42
3  70  77  40  36  40  26   5
4  43  69  66   0   6  54  95
5  83  22  21  80  96  15  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the six agents, we can use concepts from fair division, specifically aiming to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given that there are 6 agents and only 7 items, it's not possible to give each agent an equal number of items. However, we can try to allocate the items in a way that balances their values as evenly as possible across the agents.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Distribute items to agents to maximize their total allocation value, while trying to ensure no agent is left envious.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 28 + 57 + 68 + 54 + 66 + 24 + 89 = 386
- Agent 1: 22 + 30 + 47 + 2 + 98 + 6 + 51 = 256
- Agent 2: 48 + 47 + 75 + 17 + 12 + 68 + 42 = 309
- Agent 3: 70 + 77 + 40 + 36 + 40 + 26 + 5 = 294
- Agent 4: 43 + 69 + 66 + 0 + 6 + 54 + 95 = 333
- Agent 5: 83 + 22 + 21 + 80 + 96 + 15 + 65 = 382

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 4 (96). Allocate item 4 to Agent 5.
- Agent 0 values item 6 highly (89). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly (66). Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly (77). Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (22). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly (68). Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 4 also values item 3 (0). Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Finally, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 3],
    "5": [4]
}
```

This allocation seeks to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy as much as possible given the constraints.
