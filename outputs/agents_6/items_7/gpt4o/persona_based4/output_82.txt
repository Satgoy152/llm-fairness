Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  37  73  39  99  81  43
1  42  83  50  91  49  99  91
2  97  92  43  28   3  36  98
3  87  17  71  62  72  96  75
4   3   9  43  21  58  46   5
5  70  97  98  37  97  70  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation that considers the agents' valuations and attempts to achieve envy-freeness, I'll use a strategy based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Given that we have 6 agents and 7 items, it is possible that some agents might not receive any items, or that one agent might receive more than one item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation highly while minimizing envy.

Here is one potential fair allocation based on the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest at 99.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest at 99.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest at 97.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest at 96, but item 3 is the next highest at 62, which is not yet allocated.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest at 58, but item 2 is the next highest at 43, which is not yet allocated.
6. **Agent 5** values item 2 the highest at 98, but item 1 is the next highest at 97, which is not yet allocated.

Considering these priorities, I will assign items as follows:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [2]
- Agent 5: [1, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, except for Agent 5, who receives two items due to the remaining available items and their high valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1, 6]
}
```
