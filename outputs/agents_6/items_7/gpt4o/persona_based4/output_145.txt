Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  93  72  86   0  15  38
1   5  56  48  26   2  58  41
2  33  75  96  37   8  95  67
3  34  27  71  70  22  18   2
4  28  90   9  39  21  30  21
5  83  31  62  36   1  88  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items in such a way that each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocation. Here's one way to allocate the items while aiming for fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 1 (93) and item 2 (72). Let's allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 5 (58). Let's allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 2 (96) and item 5 (95). Item 5 is already allocated, so let's allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 2 (71) and item 3 (70). Item 2 is already allocated, so let's allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 highly values item 1 (90). Item 1 is already allocated, so let's allocate item 0 (28) to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 highly values item 0 (83) and item 5 (88). Both are already allocated, so let's allocate item 6 (48) to agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We have 2 more items left: item 4 and item 6. We will have to adjust the allocation so that all items are allocated.

- **Item 4 (22)**: Allocate to Agent 3, who values it the most.
- **Item 6 (38)**: Allocate to Agent 0, who values it.

Let's finalize the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [1, 6]
2. **Agent 1**: Items [5]
3. **Agent 2**: Items [2]
4. **Agent 3**: Items [3, 4]
5. **Agent 4**: Items [0]
6. **Agent 5**: []

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints and valuations provided.
