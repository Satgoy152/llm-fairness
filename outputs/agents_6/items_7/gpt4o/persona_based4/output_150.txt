Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  82  91  11  57  72  52
1  92  49  67  98  98  81  29
2  78  62  41  78  19  74   1
3  52  79  37  51  64  81  31
4  20  94  55  81  60  33  54
5  96  20  14  64  54  70  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness with discrete items and integer allocations, we strive to minimize envy as much as possible.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocated Item 2, as it has a high value for Agent 0 (91) compared to others.
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Allocated Item 3 and Item 4. Agent 1 places a high value on these items (98 each).
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Allocated Item 0, since it has a reasonably high value for Agent 2 (78).
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Allocated Item 5, which has a high value for Agent 3 (81).
   
5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Allocated Item 1, as Agent 4 values it highly (94).
   
6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Allocated Item 6, since Agent 5 places a relatively high value on it (43).

By distributing the items in this manner, we ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value. It's not perfectly envy-free, but it is a reasonable attempt given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6]
}
```
