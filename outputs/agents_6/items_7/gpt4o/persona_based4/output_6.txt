Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  20  30  35  11  84  74
1  58   1  28   1  22   4  76
2   1  64  47  30   0  51  76
3  40   5   8  59  23  40  74
4  10  66  38   8  76  39   4
5  81  93   3  80  94  96  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [81 93  3 80 94 96 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Given the table, let's try to assign items to agents such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is somewhat balanced and any envy is minimized.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 5.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 6.
3. Agent 2 values item 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 2.

Based on this, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [6]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Item [3]
- Agent 4: Item [4]
- Agent 5: Item [2]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item that they value, which should help in reducing envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2]
}
```
