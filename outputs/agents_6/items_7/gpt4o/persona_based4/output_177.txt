Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  78  82  52  33  10  29
1  37  41  65  17  79   0  90
2  17  47  66  40  87  99  30
3   5  25  69  60  37  47  89
4  16  78  62  24  34  58  38
5  52  31  11  65  56  57  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating the items among the agents, we need to consider the principles of fair division, specifically focusing on the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations matrix, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation to the best extent possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most**: This helps in minimizing envy since each agent gets at least one item that they highly value.

2. **Balance the distribution**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while keeping the total number of items correctly allocated.

3. **Check for envy-freeness**: After an initial allocation, check if any agent would prefer another's allocation over their own and make adjustments if necessary.

Following these principles, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (82), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly (90), so assign item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly (99), so assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly (60), so assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (78), so assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 highly (52), so assign item 0 to agent 5.

After this initial assignment, only item 4 remains unallocated. We distribute it to an agent who does not have the highest envy or would benefit from an additional item:

- Agent 1 values item 4 fairly high (79), and since they only have one item (item 6), allocate item 4 to agent 1.

Now, all items are allocated, and the distribution seems reasonably fair. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0]
}
```
