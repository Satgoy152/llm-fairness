Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  56  33  58   7  88  97
1   2  17  28  87  91   5  88
2  65  42  26  76  47  59  12
3  55  97  98  32  34   3  63
4  40  96   9  29  35  40  84
5  39  88  84  73   3  19  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an approach that balances the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations. Given the constraints, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy by ensuring that each agent values their allocation as highly as possible within the given structure.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the most at 97.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the most at 91.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most at 65.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the most at 98.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the most at 96.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 2 the most at 84 (next best after Agent 3).

A possible allocation respecting the highest preferences and aiming for envy-freeness could be structured as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 0
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Item 1
- **Agent 5**: Item 5

Now, we have allocated 6 items, but we need to allocate all 7 items. We have one item left (Item 3), which can be allocated to an agent to balance the total perceived value:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (provides a significant valuation boost for Agent 0)

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a valuable item according to their preferences, while aiming to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives at least one item.
