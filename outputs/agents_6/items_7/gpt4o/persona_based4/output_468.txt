Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  61  58  82   1  53  71
1   0  38  49  68   2  19  61
2   3   5  52  76  70  54  36
3  70  87  16  24   7  31  39
4  80  22  88  12  49  62  46
5  75   0  93  54  75  27   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to ensure that each agent receives items such that no agent envies another's allocation. Given the varying valuations, a common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation that aims for fairness based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: We notice that Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for items 3 and 6. Allocating these to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 2 have moderate valuations for Agent 1, ensuring they receive a fair share.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4 stands out as having a high valuation for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 0 is allocated here, as it provides a reasonable valuation for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5 has a relatively high valuation for Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Since Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 2, but it is already allocated, we need to consider the remaining items. However, item 2 is already allocated, so Agent 5 might take a less valuable item like item 5. But since Agent 4 has item 5, they will take item 2. 

Based on these considerations, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that are relatively more valuable to them, aiming for a fair division based on the given valuations.
