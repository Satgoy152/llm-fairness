Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  99  26  74  50  11  28
1  63  33  58  40  43  13  26
2  37  27  76  26  51  72  87
3  20  24  68  98  14  74   9
4  47   9  64   3  28  24  33
5   1  72  56  86  65   1  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations provided in the table. The goal is to assign items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

We will follow an iterative approach, attempting to give each agent items that maximize their satisfaction while also ensuring that all items are distributed. This often involves balancing the highest valuations with equitable distribution.

Let's examine the table and assign items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1 (99) and item 0 (93).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 2 (58).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6 (87).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3 (98).
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4 (28).
6. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 5 (72).

Based on these observations, let's allocate items to maximize valuations while ensuring everyone receives at least one item:

- **Agent 0** receives item 1.
- **Agent 1** receives item 2.
- **Agent 2** receives item 6.
- **Agent 3** receives item 3.
- **Agent 4** receives item 4.
- **Agent 5** receives item 5.

Now, each agent has received one item, and we have one item left (item 0). We will assign this item based on remaining agent valuations:

- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 0 (93).

Thus, we allocate item 0 to Agent 0. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5]
}
```

All 7 items are now allocated, and each agent has received at least one item.
