Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  81  51  53  29  46   0
1  72  73  23  38   7  47  93
2  81  14  33  39   5  38  67
3  62  61   8  95  66  65  80
4  40  24   4  31  54  55   1
5  63  14  96  29  85  28  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find an envy-free allocation of items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as the bundles received by other agents, given their own valuations.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 81.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 81.
   - Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most at 96.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most at 85.
   - Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most at 55.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 93.

2. **Allocate the Items to the Agents with Highest Valuation:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 5.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 5.
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 4.
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Check the Allocation:**
   - Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.
   - Ensure all 7 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, every item has been allocated to the agent who values it the most, achieving a form of envy-freeness where no agent desires any other agent's allocation more than their own.
