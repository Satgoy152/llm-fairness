Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  85  37  86  42   3  20
1  39   3  33  94  84  50  21
2  17  90   3  35  71  63  64
3  43   0  74  78  74  35  41
4  41  23  97  38  63  29  57
5  88  70   2  20  23  76  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the adjusted winner procedure or a greedy allocation approach. Here, I'll employ a simple method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation given their preferences. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives a "fair" share based on their valuations, and no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (86).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (94), but since Agent 0 also highly values item 3, we allocate it to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the second highest (84).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (90).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (74).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (97), but since Agent 3 also highly values item 2, we allocate it to Agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the highest (88).

Here's how the allocation could look:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 5.

This leaves items 5 and 6, which we can allocate to the agents with fewer items:
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 values it at 63, which is relatively high).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 5 (Agent 5 values it at 80, which is relatively high).

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to be fair and minimizes envy by trying to allocate items according to the highest valuations and balancing the total number of items each agent receives.
