Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25   9  73  94  35  82  75
1  15  12  94  88  11   3  74
2   0  39  38  52  99  74  64
3  17  57  26  30  35  49  62
4  29  25  24  52  22  29  46
5   6  44  50   9   0  12  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we want to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent given their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations and consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: High value on item 3 and item 5.
2. **Agent 1**: High value on item 2 and item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: High value on item 4 and item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: More balanced values, but slightly higher on items 5 and 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Values are relatively low overall but has a somewhat higher valuation for item 3.
6. **Agent 5**: Higher value on item 2 and item 6.

We'll construct an allocation where each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution tries to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items 3 and 0 (values: 94, 25)
- **Agent 1**: Receives item 2 (value: 94)
- **Agent 2**: Receives item 4 (value: 99)
- **Agent 3**: Receives item 6 (value: 62)
- **Agent 4**: Receives item 1 (value: 25)
- **Agent 5**: Receives item 5 (value: 12)

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value relatively highly, and all items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```
