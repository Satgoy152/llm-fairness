Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  25  68  11  16  96  11
1  13  56  14  17  27  91  47
2  49  27  96  12  90  38  29
3  97  86  50  74   9  87  35
4  55   8   2  83  88  93  14
5  38  98  39  48  39   6  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items to agents fairly, ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use the maximum valuation method. This method assigns items to agents such that each item goes to the agent who values it the most. This approach does not guarantee perfect envy-freeness, but it attempts to maximize individual satisfaction by allocating based on maximum individual valuations.

Let's analyze the table and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 97 (highest).
- Item 1: Agent 5 values it at 98 (highest).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 96 (highest).
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it at 83 (highest).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 90 (highest).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 96 (highest).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 47 (highest).

Now, we can allocate the items to agents as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This method tries to minimize envy by maximizing individual valuations, but please note that achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations is not always possible in every scenario.
