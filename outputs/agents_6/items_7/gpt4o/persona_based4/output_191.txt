Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  56   7   5  94  17  13
1  73  52  28  65  19  49  22
2  13  18  85   9  35  74  38
3  44  69  24  95  99   5  95
4  33  65  49  76  57  27  43
5  14  24  51  37  27  76  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, it's essential to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. We'll aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation that considers the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (94) and item 0 (91), so allocating item 4 and item 0 to Agent 0 maximizes their utility.

2. **Agent 1** has a relatively balanced valuation, but they value item 3 (65) highest among items not yet allocated, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** places the highest value on item 2 (85), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** values item 4 (99) and item 3 (95) the most, but since item 4 is already allocated, we assign item 6 to Agent 3 to maximize their utility (95).

5. **Agent 4** values items 3 (76), 1 (65), and 4 (57) highly, but with item 3 and 4 already allocated, we can allocate item 1 (65) to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5** values item 5 (76) the highest, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, let's put this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the 6 agents while maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items available.
