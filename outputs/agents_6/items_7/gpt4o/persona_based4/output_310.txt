Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  51  91  69  81  73  28
1  91  91  23  58  26  85  89
2  38  92  93  10  75  86  86
3  34  43  11  68  52  69  41
4  66  33  37  69  68  77  79
5  24  29  60  40  56  85  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and try to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Given the valuations, we can use a simple approach to allocate items by considering each agent's highest-valued items in sequence, ensuring that every agent is considered, and that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 2 (91). Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for items 0 and 1 (both 91). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 2 (93), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 1 (92). Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 5 (69). Allocate item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 6 (79). Allocate item 6 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 5 (85), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 3 (60). Allocate item 3 to agent 5.

Now, each agent has been considered once. We have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. One item remains unallocated: item 4.

7. **Final Allocation**: For item 4, we check which agent values it most among those who have fewer items. Agent 0 values item 4 at 81, which is the highest remaining value for item 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

The final allocations can now be presented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [3]
}
```
