Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  13  35  54   7  19   2
1  24   9  69  12  54  58  19
2   3  53  48  25  71  60  25
3  37  83  27  29  55  65  68
4  93  93  95   3  75  77  40
5   5  13  69  32  78  54  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among agents. To start, let's consider some basic principles of fair division such as maximizing total utility and attempting to ensure each agent is satisfied according to their valuations.

First, let's summarize the total valuation each agent has for all items, which might help in understanding their preferences:

- Agent 0: Total valuation = 149
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 245
- Agent 2: Total valuation = 285
- Agent 3: Total valuation = 364
- Agent 4: Total valuation = 476
- Agent 5: Total valuation = 328

Given these total valuations, we attempt to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. We will try to minimize envy by allocating items that maximize each agent's individual satisfaction and ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's proceed with a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefer items with highest valuations, which are item 3 (54) and item 2 (35). They get item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 2 (69) and item 5 (58). They get item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for item 4 (71) and item 5 (60). They get item 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 1 (83) and item 5 (65). They get item 1.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for item 2 (95) and item 5 (77). They get item 5.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuations are for item 4 (78) and item 6 (77). They get item 6.

Now, let's allocate the remaining item:

- The remaining item is item 0. Given the highest valuation for item 0 is by Agent 4 (93), but they've already gotten item 5, we need to balance remaining items with agents who have fewer allocations. Agent 0, who values item 0 at 19, has only one item allocated so far, thus they get item 0.

With these allocations, let's summarize:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent gets items in a way that attempts to balance their satisfaction based on their individual valuations.
