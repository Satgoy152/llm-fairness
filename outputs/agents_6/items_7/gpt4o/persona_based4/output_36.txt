Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  67  93  62  31  51   5
1  48   7  82  23   7  39  81
2  21  13  13  68  20  96  55
3   0  70   2  27  68  11   1
4  47   3  94  32  79  41   9
5   0  25   2  58  84  40  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of "envy-freeness," which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that we have 6 agents and 7 items, one agent will receive an extra item compared to others. 

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Prioritize giving each agent at least one item based on their highest valuation.
2. Allocate the remaining items by trying to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible.

Let's consider the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (93)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (82)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (96)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (70)
- Agent 4: Item 2 (94)
- Agent 5: Item 4 (84)

Since Item 2 is highly valued by multiple agents, we should try to allocate it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring a fair allocation for others.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 2
- Agent 5: Items 3 and 4

With this allocation, each agent gets one item, except for Agent 5, who gets two items. This is a balanced approach given the constraints.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item, with the goal of minimizing envy.
