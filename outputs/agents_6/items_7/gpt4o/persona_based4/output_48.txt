Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  47   6  17  96   3  34
1   8   1  86  39  57   2  50
2   9  27  25  53  76   7  24
3  74  33  22  25  68  92   4
4  60  19  71  27  78  83  26
5  21  51  64  91  29  21  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we want to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their own bundle of items, given their valuations. A common method is to use algorithms like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or "Divide and Choose," but given the discrete nature of this problem, I will use a simple direct assignment approach to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, with the highest value for them.

Let's analyze the problem and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (value 96).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (value 86).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 4 (value 76). But since item 4 is already assigned, next highest is item 3 (value 53).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 5 (value 92).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 5 (value 83). But since item 5 is already assigned, next highest is item 4 (value 78). Both are taken, so next is item 2 (value 71).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 6 (value 99).

Reviewing the allocations so far, there are still some items left:

- Item 0: Allocate to Agent 3 (second highest value after item 5)
- Item 1: Allocate to Agent 5 (second highest value after item 6)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [6, 1]
}
```

Each agent gets the items with the highest available values from their perspective, and all items are allocated.
