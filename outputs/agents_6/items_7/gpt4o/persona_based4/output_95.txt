Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  30  73  62  49  12  47
1  74  84  41  19  10  37  42
2  19  58  51  31  38  58  37
3  69  39   8  75  11  42  48
4  37   8  92  51   8  13  68
5  96  83  30  63  86  92  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations while trying to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Given there are 7 items and 6 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that attempts to balance the valuations:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** We start by identifying items with high valuation differences, which might be crucial for specific agents to feel less envious. For instance, agent 5 highly values item 6.
   
2. **Initial Allocation of High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 6 to agent 5 since they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 4 since they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 5 since they have the highest valuation for it.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance Valuation:**
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1, maximizing their valuation for an item they value highly.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 5, again maximizing their valuation.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 3, as it provides them with a high value.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0 to give them a meaningful allocation.

Now, let's verify that each item is allocated and each agent has been considered. The allocation should ensure that no agent feels too envious of another, considering the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and the allocation attempts to maximize each agent's value based on the given valuations.
