Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  50  87  48  12  22  83
1  85  94  45   1   0  42  36
2  65  93  85   1  27  37  49
3  36  49  12  43  50  95  12
4  80   8  18  20  99  71  66
5  66  85  32  82  57  89  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the six agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. One common method to achieve a fair division is to use a round-robin approach or an envy-free algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure. Given the small number of items and agents, a simple heuristic approach could also be sufficient. 

Here's a proposed allocation process:

1. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 0 (94, 85). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 (85) and item 6 (49). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (95). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 (99). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
5. **Agent 5** highly values item 3 (82). Assign item 3 to Agent 5.
6. **Agent 0** values item 6 (83) the most, among the remaining items. Assign item 6 to Agent 0. 
7. Assign the remaining item 0 to the agent who has not yet received any item, which is Agent 0. 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the assignment tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued available item.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure each agent gets at least one of their higher-valued items, reducing potential envy among agents.
