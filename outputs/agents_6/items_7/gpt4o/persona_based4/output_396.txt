Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89   0  66  93  16  71  34
1  81  40  14  31  40  48  20
2  66   5  48  24  62  34  26
3  34  74  21  11  10   0  24
4  30  82  11  37  22  42  51
5  52  77  19  23  89  31  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. A common approach is to use a method such as the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" method, where each agent picks their most valued item from the remaining items, one at a time.

Given the valuations provided, we can attempt to allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3, so they will pick item 3.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0, so they will pick item 0.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4, so they will pick item 4.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 1, so they will pick item 1.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 1, but since it's already taken, they go for the next highest, which is item 6.
6. **Agent 5** highly values item 4, but since it's already taken, they go for the next highest, which is item 5.

Now the remaining item is item 2. Distribute it to the agent who has the lowest total value based on their already allocated items:

- Agent 0: 93 (item 3)
- Agent 1: 89 (item 0)
- Agent 2: 62 (item 4)
- Agent 3: 74 (item 1)
- Agent 4: 51 (item 6)
- Agent 5: 31 (item 5)

Agent 5 has the lowest total value, so they receive item 2.

With this allocation, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent has a fair share of the items according to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5, 2]
}
```
