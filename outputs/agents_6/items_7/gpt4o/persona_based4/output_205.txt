Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  76  81  31  69   2  61
1  45  49   6  30  67  30  27
2  37  78  60  45  18  63  14
3   6  87  65   4  62  60  60
4  37  83  33   1  32  23  76
5  63   3  27  61  44  63  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate these items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method similar to the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach. This method involves each agent taking turns to pick their most preferred item from the remaining available items. 

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (value of 90). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** next values item 4 (value of 67). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 (value of 78). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1, but it's taken. So, item 2 is next (value of 65). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 (value of 76). Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** values item 6, but it's taken. So, item 5 is next (value of 63). Assign item 5 to Agent 5.

Now, we go for the remaining unallocated items:

7. The remaining item 3 can be allocated to the agent who values it the most among those with fewer items. Agent 5 values item 3 the most (value of 61). Assign item 3 to Agent 5.

In this way, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to respect agents' preferences, reducing potential envy between them. Each agent gets at least one item, and no agent is left without any allocation.
