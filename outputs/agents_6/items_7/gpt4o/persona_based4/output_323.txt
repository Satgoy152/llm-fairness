Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  82   6  46  57  40  10
1  12   9  40   8  32  46  15
2   9  37   7  78   0  72  96
3  60  13  46  67  70  97  47
4   1  71  47  54   1  76  84
5  29  36  30  54  68  98  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider the preferences of each agent and try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations. Given that there are 7 items and 6 agents, one agent will receive two items and the others will receive one item each.

To achieve a fair division, consider the highest valuations each agent assigns to the available items, ensuring that each agent receives at least one highly valued item according to their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (95) and Item 1 (82).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (46) and Item 2 (40).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (96) and Item 3 (78).
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (97) and Item 4 (70).
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (84) and Item 5 (76).
   - Since Item 6 is taken, allocate Item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (98) and Item 4 (68).
   - Since both are taken, allocate Item 1 to Agent 5.

Now, we have allocated 6 items, so we need to allocate one more item to make it 7 in total. We can give one more item to an agent who can receive an additional item without causing envy:

- Agent 0, who values Item 1 highly, can also be allocated Item 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one highly valued item, and one agent (Agent 0) receives two items, which is necessary given the total number of items.
