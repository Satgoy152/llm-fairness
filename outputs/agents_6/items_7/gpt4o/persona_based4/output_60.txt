Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  14  37  91  43  13  23
1  70  33  92  63  92  20  96
2  54   3  79  10  99  63  56
3  22  29  16  13  32  75  88
4  97   9  46  36  51  46  84
5  50  41  54  66  97  95  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, or at least as fair as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations and the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items while ensuring all 7 items are allocated, we can proceed with a simple heuristic to distribute these items.

We'll start by considering each agent's highest-valued item and proceed from there, trying to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 1** values item 6 the most (value of 96), so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (value of 99), so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- **Agent 4** values item 0 the most (value of 97), so we allocate item 0 to agent 4.
- **Agent 5** values item 5 the most (value of 95), so we allocate item 5 to agent 5.
- **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (value of 91), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- **Agent 3** values item 6 the most, but it's already allocated, so we allocate the next highest available item, item 2, to agent 3.
- **Agent 1** has a remaining high value for item 1 (value of 33), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed, with each agent receiving items that are among their higher-valued ones.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and no more than 7 items are allocated in total.
