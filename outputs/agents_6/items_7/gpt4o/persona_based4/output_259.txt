Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79   6  26  77  67   1  49
1  43  31  93  23  33  38  19
2  98  46  94  85   4  31  13
3  75  24  15  22  88  38  76
4  85  51   0  11  40  91  32
5  20  12  45  17  44  36  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider an allocation strategy that prioritizes fairness and aims to minimize envy. A common method for achieving envy-freeness in fair division is the "maximum marginal utility" approach, where we iteratively allocate items to the agent who values them the most.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (98). Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (51). Assign Item 1 to Agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (94). Since Agent 2 already has Item 0, we check other agents. The next highest valuation is by Agent 1 (93). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (85). However, Agent 2 has already received an item, so we consider the next highest valuation, which is by Agent 0 (77). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (88). Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (91). Since Agent 4 already has Item 1, we consider the next highest valuation, which is by Agent 3 (38). But since Agent 3 also has an item, we assign Item 5 to Agent 5 (36), the next highest.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (49). Since Agent 0 already has Item 3, we check the next highest, Agent 3 (76), who already has an item. Finally, assign to Agent 5 (54).

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on the highest utility for each item while ensuring each agent gets at least one item or none where unavoidable. Note that there's a trade-off between ensuring every agent gets an item and maximizing the total valuation per agent.
