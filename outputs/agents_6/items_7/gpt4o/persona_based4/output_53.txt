Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 6 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  60  80  20   5  63  43
1  30  37  57  59  82  24  58
2  55  81  42  33  82  39   0
3  39  92  21  89  49  51  24
4  21  24  86  64  63  52   7
5  50  36  87  24  37  48  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the 7 items to the 6 agents in a way that is as fair as possible, taking into account their individual valuations of the items. We'll aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

To start, let's analyze the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [33, 60, 80, 20, 5, 63, 43]
Agent 1: [30, 37, 57, 59, 82, 24, 58]
Agent 2: [55, 81, 42, 33, 82, 39, 0]
Agent 3: [39, 92, 21, 89, 49, 51, 24]
Agent 4: [21, 24, 86, 64, 63, 52, 7]
Agent 5: [50, 36, 87, 24, 37, 48, 13]
```

To achieve a fair distribution, we can use a method like the "maximum value allocation," which assigns items to agents based on their highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet. We need to ensure each item is allocated and that the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's proceed with assigning items based on each agent's highest remaining value:

1. **Assign item 2 to Agent 5** (highest value: 87)
2. **Assign item 4 to Agent 1** (highest remaining value: 82)
3. **Assign item 1 to Agent 3** (highest remaining value: 92)
4. **Assign item 0 to Agent 2** (highest remaining value: 55)
5. **Assign item 5 to Agent 0** (highest remaining value: 63)
6. **Assign item 3 to Agent 4** (next highest remaining value: 64)
7. **Assign item 6 to Agent 1** (remaining item with reasonable value: 58)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest available values without overlapping.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items, ensuring each agent receives items closest to their highest valuations, which helps in minimizing envy.
