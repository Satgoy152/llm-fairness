Input:

The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items.  numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.9.

      0     1      2
0  1.06  0.62   3.68
1  8.13  7.60  13.90

Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
{
    "0": [0,1,2],
    "1": [3,4],
    "2": [5,6,7]
}

Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we have two agents and three items to allocate.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 1.06
  - Item 1: 0.62
  - Item 2: 3.68

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 8.13
  - Item 1: 7.60
  - Item 2: 13.90

To allocate the items fairly, we can use the following approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Following this rule:

- Item 0 is valued more by Agent 1 (8.13) than by Agent 0 (1.06).
- Item 1 is valued more by Agent 1 (7.60) than by Agent 0 (0.62).
- Item 2 is valued more by Agent 1 (13.90) than by Agent 0 (3.68).

Therefore, all items will be allocated to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values all items more than Agent 0.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives no items, and Agent 1 receives all items. This allocation maximizes the total value received by the agents based on their valuations.
