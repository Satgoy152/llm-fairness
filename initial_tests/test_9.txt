Input:

The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items.  numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.04.

      0     1     2
0  3.94  2.36  0.13
1  4.15  5.80  0.04

Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Output:

To fairly allocate items between the two agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the “max-min fairness” or “envy-free” allocation approach. In this context, each agent should ideally receive the items they value most to maximize fairness and satisfaction.

Here’s how we can approach the problem:

	1.	Rank the items for each agent based on their valuations.
	2.	Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible.
	3.	If an item can be valued by both agents (i.e., one agent values it slightly more), consider allocating to avoid creating envy or bias in the overall distribution.

Step 1: List the Valuations

From the table:

	•	Agent 0’s valuations for items are [3.94, 2.36, 0.13].
	•	Agent 1’s valuations for items are [4.15, 5.80, 0.04].

Step 2: Identify High-Valuation Preferences

To fairly allocate:

	•	Item 0: Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (4.15 vs. 3.94).
	•	Item 1: Agent 1 values it significantly more than Agent 0 (5.80 vs. 2.36).
	•	Item 2: Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 (0.13 vs. 0.04).

Step 3: Allocation Based on Maximized Fairness

To achieve a balanced, envy-free allocation:

	•	Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
	•	Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
	•	Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

Final Allocation

The final allocation ensuring integer ownership and maximizing satisfaction is:

	•	Agent 0 receives Item 2.
	•	Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.

This allocation maximizes each agent’s utility by assigning them the items they value most, resulting in a fair and envy-minimized distribution.
