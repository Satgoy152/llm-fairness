Input:

The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items.  numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.91.

       0     1      2
0   7.59  6.09  25.96
1  28.04  6.32   8.91

Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Output:

To fairly allocate items between two agents so that each receives an integer number of items, we’ll use the following strategy:

	1.	Determine the total number of items: We have three items (0, 1, and 2).
	2.	Optimize fairness based on valuations: To create a fair allocation, we aim to maximize each agent’s satisfaction with the items they receive. Given that each agent will receive one or two items, we’ll find an allocation that gives each agent the highest possible total value from their assigned items.

Here’s the allocation solution process:

Step-by-Step Allocation

	1.	Calculate all possible allocations: With two agents and three items, possible allocations of items include:
	•	Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, and Agent 1 receives item 2.
	•	Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receives item 1.
	•	Agent 0 receives item 1, and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.
	2.	Sum up the valuations for each allocation:
	•	Allocation 1:
	•	Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1: ￼
	•	Agent 1 receives item 2: ￼
	•	Allocation 2:
	•	Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2: ￼
	•	Agent 1 receives item 1: ￼
	•	Allocation 3:
	•	Agent 0 receives item 1: ￼
	•	Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2: ￼
	3.	Evaluate fairness and select the optimal allocation:
	•	Allocation 1 gives Agent 0 a value of 13.68 and Agent 1 a value of 8.91.
	•	Allocation 2 gives Agent 0 a value of 33.55 and Agent 1 a value of 6.32.
	•	Allocation 3 gives Agent 0 a value of 6.09 and Agent 1 a value of 36.95.
Allocation 3 maximizes total satisfaction by giving each agent the highest possible combined value for their assigned items.

Final Allocation

	•	Agent 0 receives item 1 (value = 6.09).
	•	Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2 (values = 28.04 and 8.91, total = 36.95).

This allocation provides a fair distribution of the items while maximizing each agent’s overall valuation, with Agent 0 receiving one item and Agent 1 receiving two items.
