Input:

The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items.  numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.69.

       0      1      2
0   7.67  12.61  13.37
1  56.96  15.75  33.69

Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Output:

To fairly allocate items among agents with integer quantities, we can apply the maximum sum allocation method or greedy allocation method, where each agent gets items based on their valuation until every item is assigned.

Here’s the step-by-step allocation:

	1.	Agent 1 values item 0 at 56.96, which is the highest valuation in the table, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
	2.	The next highest valuation is 33.69 by Agent 1 for item 2, so item 2 also goes to Agent 1.
	3.	Finally, the only remaining item, item 1, goes to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation is:

	•	Agent 0 gets item 1
	•	Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2

This allocation maximizes each agent’s total valuation of their assigned items.
