Input:

The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 3 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2
0  66  50  79
1  62  45  52

Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
{
    "0": [0,1,2],
    "1": [3,4],
    "2": [5,6,7]
}

Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method known as "maximum sum assignment" or "Hungarian algorithm," which maximizes the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.

Given the valuations table:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|------------|----|----|----|
| 0          | 66 | 50 | 79 |
| 1          | 62 | 45 | 52 |

We aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's consider the possible allocations:

1. **Total Value Calculation:**
   - If Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 gets item 1:
     - Agent 0's total value = 66 (item 0) + 79 (item 2) = 145
     - Agent 1's total value = 45 (item 1)
     - Total value = 145 + 45 = 190

2. **Alternative Allocation:**
   - If Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, and Agent 1 gets item 2:
     - Agent 0's total value = 66 (item 0) + 50 (item 1) = 116
     - Agent 1's total value = 52 (item 2)
     - Total value = 116 + 52 = 168

3. **Another Alternative Allocation:**
   - If Agent 0 gets item 1, and Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2:
     - Agent 0's total value = 50 (item 1)
     - Agent 1's total value = 62 (item 0) + 52 (item 2) = 114
     - Total value = 50 + 114 = 164

The allocation that maximizes the total value is the first option, where Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 gets item 1.

Thus, the fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1]
}
```
